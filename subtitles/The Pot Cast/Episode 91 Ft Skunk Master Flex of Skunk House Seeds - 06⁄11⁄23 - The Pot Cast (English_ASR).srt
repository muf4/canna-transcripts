it I'm a huge fan of Bubba Kush um

169
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
really really really like the high from

170
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,680
it really relaxing High

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,079
uh it's always been a favorite since the

172
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,639
first day I smoked it um it doesn't

173
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,560
doesn't make its rounds anymore people

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,639
aren't really using it too much you know

175
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,598
some of the older guys I mean I see uh

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,038
CSI and a couple guys still working with

177
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,879
bubak Kush but definitely not as popular

178
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,279
as it was in the past it's kind of

179
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,439
upsetting

180
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,239
really yeah I mean I think the the the

181
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,399
main criticism I hear of bber is that

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,160
it's a slow veger I guess the question

183
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,758
is do you think that's the predominant

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,639
reason for the decline or do you think

185
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,560
there's other sort of types of high that

186
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:08,160
have replaced it I think I think it's a

187
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,800
little bit of everything really you know

188
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,479
um it is a slow veger but so is URL and

189
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,280
so are a lot of other ones um I think on

190
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:20,598
a production standpoint the prices of

191
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,159
cannabis in the United States right now

192
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,639
I mean I don't think people are doing it

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,520
to scale but I mean on a personal Garden

194
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:32,280
I always have a couple in there um yeah

195
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,519
I said it's just yeah just not as

196
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,959
popular I think people are going through

197
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,758
these new you know designer strings

198
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,159
these

199
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,919
hybrids sativas I'm even seeing starting

200
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,199
to pop up more than they were in the

201
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,799
early 2000s 2010s so who knows where

202
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,960
it's going to be here for

203
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,680
now yeah look you just quickly mentioned

204
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,680
it so I'd love to touch on it where do

205
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,918
you sit on sativas versus indicas

206
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,639
because I think if a lot of people

207
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,279
looked at your catalog of work they'd

208
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,879
see a lot of indicio work do you have a

209
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:04,758
soft spot for C

210
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,599
uh I'm not a sativa guy for just

211
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:11,199
medicinal purposes myself I'm heavy Inda

212
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,240
smoker um sativas give me anxiety

213
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,759
sometimes

214
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,158
man

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,240
um bod gave me a cut of Temple Haze

216
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:24,319
years ago and it was like my first entry

217
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:28,360
to like a full-blown sativa that was

218
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,560
like super racy and I like drew it out

219
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,200
got all excited did um rolled up the

220
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,399
first joint of it and took like maybe a

221
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,320
quarter of it down and like wanted to

222
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,440
crawl out of my own

223
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,720
skin it was just it was just too much

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,480
for me you know um not my cup of tea I

225
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,839
do need to work with some though because

226
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,839
I do you know appreciate that people do

227
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,880
like sativas but um yeah on a personal

228
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,680
level it's just just not for

229
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,799
me yeah wow look I think I think most

230
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,278
people can relate to uh you know

231
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,958
indulging in some sativa and going a

232
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,519
little too far feeling a bit like

233
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,639
yourself there that's that's really

234
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,600
interesting to hear I mean out of

235
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,679
curiosity um have you ever had any

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,720
requests to breed with sativas I feel

237
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,359
like super silver hay is having a bit of

238
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,278
a comeback do you ever get any request

239
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,919
to do any Harbridge with things like

240
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:24,559
that absolutely um and Super Silver Haze

241
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:28,879
is a classic man um I had like this 45

242
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:31,838
50-day pheno um like a decade ago that I

243
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,919
used used in some of my earlier stuff um

244
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,320
it

245
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,519
just kind of got overshadowed by

246
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,360
everything else you know but I do agree

247
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,759
that sativas are kind of like you know

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,720
hot right now they're definitely coming

249
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:46,078
back um lots of people requesting it I

250
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,440
just haven't really you know dip my toe

251
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,159
into that sativa world really and uh

252
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,959
gotten to appreciate it because I don't

253
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,199
you know for my personal use I don't I

254
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,278
don't really touch it but for other

255
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,399
people I mean yeah obviously as as a

256
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,480
breeder you want to offer things in your

257
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,120
catalog for every everybody so

258
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,920
definitely some sust work coming down

259
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,278
the

260
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:08,319
line yeah nice stuff cool to hear I

261
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,559
guess this might seem like a silly

262
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
question to you but I've actually heard

263
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:14,799
a lot of people discuss this um before

264
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,879
we delve into you know the the rabbit

265
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,639
hole that is the GMO I'd love to just

266
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,759
quickly ask as a preface do you

267
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,399
understand what people say when you

268
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,360
maybe sometimes hear people say that

269
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:30,600
they feel GMO is a sativa absolutely um

270
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,159
the thing about GMO that tricky that I

271
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,399
think a lot of people caught in on is

272
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:37,399
the amount of time taken to flower that

273
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,600
plant to get it to completion where it's

274
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,720
where it's actually fully matured um if

275
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,839
you take it early it can get racy you

276
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,320
know um proper GMOs like close to 90

277
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,760
days so I mean if you're talking about

278
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
you know somebody maybe running on a

279
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:58,399
commercial scale maybe trying to stay in

280
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,159
the 9we 60 63 day range um I mean I've

281
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
I've had race batches that I've taken

282
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:07,439
down early some people love it for me my

283
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,959
sweet spot for the GMO is like 80 to 83

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,320
days it's it's a perfect balance it's

285
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:18,399
not too hard I can still enjoy it um it

286
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,360
won't put me down to sleep but I don't

287
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,759
get any of that sativa out of it but

288
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,200
that's you know that's a personal thing

289
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,639
that's again you know I'm not a sativa

290
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,720
really smoker so that's where my sweet

291
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,639
spot

292
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,360
is yeah interesting and I mean what part

293
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,560
of the genetics do you think it is that

294
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,600
leads it to have that what most people

295
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,359
would consider to be quite uh like a

296
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
longer flowering time than what you

297
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,919
might expect from the parents on paper

298
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,320
any idea where that might be coming from

299
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,919
there's like you know I've had this

300
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,079
conversation with a lot of people over

301
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:55,078
the years and there was mentions about

302
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,638
maybe something got mixed up in a bag

303
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,359
maybe it's not what it's you know it's

304
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,839
not CHD crossed with Forum cut maybe

305
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,360
it's something else maybe there's you

306
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:09,000
know maybe a sne seed stuck in the bag

307
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,320
that I got was different it's you know I

308
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,078
mean it was completely different than

309
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,760
the rest of the [ __ ] seeds that I

310
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,919
popped out of that that um bag of seed

311
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,759
that I got you know it was the standout

312
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:25,759
the entire time from sprouting the seed

313
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:28,519
in a Solo Cup to um you know

314
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:32,078
transplanting it to everything like that

315
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,959
that grew finished looked completely

316
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,879
different than everything else in that

317
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,759
in that group so I mean I wouldn't be

318
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,958
surprised if it if it might be something

319
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,799
else

320
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,278
but you know who's to say you know that

321
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,519
whole Cham lineage is so you know

322
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,320
unknown really that maybe it's something

323
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,198
in the back genetics you know a

324
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,360
grandparent coming through um who knows

325
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:58,159
you know so hard to call it you know I

326
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,399
just kind of take it for what it is and

327
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,919
it's just a just a really unique plant

328
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,159
that I I just really love to you know

329
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:08,159
breed with and people seem to love to

330
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,759
hash and it's just really really you

331
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,519
know epic it's an epic

332
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,519
find yeah tell me a little bit about the

333
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,198
concentrate potential and how maybe um

334
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,879
you know that doorway has opened up

335
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,679
since finding the GMO because I know for

336
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,879
a lot of people you know GMO was a game

337
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,799
changer for concentrates to them how has

338
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,078
it changed your perspective on it I mean

339
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,359
I've had people walk up to me and say

340
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:34,719
the GMO made me a

341
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,000
millionaire you know like and it's like

342
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,000
like a big group of people like many

343
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,720
people um it's a hash monster you know

344
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,240
it just dumps the type of triome it

345
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,120
produces um it put you know it puts out

346
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,440
that Sandy type of you know

347
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,679
Tricom and it just it as a breeding tool

348
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,160
for you know making hash strains is just

349
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,559
amazing you know especially if you can

350
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,838
if you can breed read it where you can't

351
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,039
really see its presence as much but some

352
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,279
of its attributes gets passed through

353
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,480
it's just like I said just just an epic

354
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,519
fres yeah incredible and I mean like I

355
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,560
think one of the comments I've

356
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,600
specifically heard a lot is that you

357
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,518
know the the turpine profile it really

358
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,159
translates to the end product of

359
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,198
concentrates and obviously you know not

360
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,120
every strain does that as well as you'd

361
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,159
like what's your plans in terms of

362
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,240
breeding concentrates going forward is

363
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,958
it something you actively think about or

364
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,639
is it just a peripheral thing and it's

365
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,439
like well if the genetics facilitate a

366
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,720
good plant then like you know

367
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,720
cool I mean these days you have to

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,879
basically breed for part of the intent

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,160
to be

370
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,720
concentrates um the concentrate Market

371
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:48,958
is just so big between you know people

372
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,240
making these um rosin and resin pens um

373
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,758
just the demand for hashers is so big

374
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,879
that to breed and not take that

375
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,639
consideration would be a major mistake

376
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,919
in my opinion um

377
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,278
luckily the majority the bulk of the

378
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,240
work that I do has you know small

379
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:09,399
amounts at least of GMO in the lineage

380
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,759
so um any cross really if you really do

381
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,519
a proper hunt you can come across

382
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,360
something you know that'll just dump

383
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,078
that's that's awesome you know amazing

384
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:22,240
and unique um the GMO does tend to be

385
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,879
dominant in genetic crosses um so I

386
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,240
found like if you kind of like knock it

387
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,720
down to where it's like 25% of a

388
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,600
pedigree um you can really start finding

389
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,199
some amazing things that don't get

390
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,480
dominated by it but just offer you know

391
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,399
their own you know unique twists that

392
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,480
are

393
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,839
just you know amazing and yield and and

394
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,079
dump and just tastes great and have

395
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,639
unique tur

396
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,239
profiles

397
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:52,318
um a lot of the work that I do you know

398
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,198
it's it is for hash so luckily the GMO

399
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,599
kind of definitely assists in that

400
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,240
department yeah that's awesome to hear

401
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,839
Look I think we may as well we jump into

402
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,318
the discussion now because we've already

403
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,560
we've already basically started it but I

404
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:08,039
just wanted to ask one one last quick

405
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:11,239
question which is I um I I got given a

406
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:13,318
bud of a GMO from Adam Dunn last year at

407
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,079
one of the events and I have to be

408
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,639
honest it was it was so putrid smelling

409
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,039
in a good way I was like I don't know if

410
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,440
I can smoke this have you ever had any

411
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,240
experiences like that where it was like

412
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,279
a little too gnarly and you're like this

413
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,079
is this is full on yeah it's like so

414
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:32,078
when when I first started doing a of it

415
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:34,479
you know obviously this is um premedical

416
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,359
um at least you know we weren't doing

417
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,440
medical grows it was just a you know

418
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,639
kind of a black market grow um we would

419
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,839
have to move a bunch of the you know

420
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,278
pounds and go from City to city and it

421
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,720
was just so gnarly smelling you know um

422
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,799
my buddy that was helping me you know

423
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,680
move a bunch of it he had this uh this

424
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,799
two-door Cadillac and uh we always threw

425
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,439
a bunch in the in the trunk and drove to

426
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,758
Ann Arbor which was the first place that

427
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,558
we were kind of doing drops at um Tree

428
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,838
City and uh we moved so much weight in

429
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:12,918
that trunk that it permanently stained

430
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:14,279
his car it just the smell never came out

431
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,759
they had to you know they had to send it

432
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,160
out to I think it was like Dubai or

433
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,838
something like or Lebanon or some some

434
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,519
other country just to just to get rid of

435
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,159
it you know anybody that sat in the

436
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,798
thing in the used car lot was like man

437
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
this thing smells terrible like it

438
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,519
smells like weed they just couldn't get

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
the smell out of it so I mean it

440
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,480
definitely has a staining attribute to

441
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,600
it and it's putrid and and some people

442
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,919
love it and some people just absolutely

443
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,599
hate

444
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,120
it which you know I get you know you

445
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,719
know everybody has their own you know

446
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:50,239
preferred flavors for cannabis but um

447
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,640
it's it's almost unbearable to some

448
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
people and I find that kind of

449
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,240
fascinating and hilarious at the same

450
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,038
time you know like it's just from the

451
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,679
first batches of it it was just like I

452
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,079
said like it was a standout it was

453
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,400
unique lots of opinions on it you know

454
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,158
like you said you know you got got a bud

455
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,360
and it was just like so so so offensive

456
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,799
that you didn't want to smoke it like I

457
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,959
think that's I don't know I find that to

458
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:13,960
be

459
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,279
funny definitely and I mean another sort

460
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,839
of comment SL observation I'd heard is

461
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,519
that you know GMO really illustrates the

462
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,240
point that you know with just I I guess

463
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,839
I'll have to sort of paint in Broad SS

464
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,839
here but like a lot of males in the

465
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,959
industry are really attracted to the

466
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,199
most accurd offensive off-putting sort

467
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,319
of smells you get and GMO really

468
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,200
highlights that and then you know you

469
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,038
you find that some of the females are

470
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
really not that interested in that sort

471
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,879
of smell you know have you ever noticed

472
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,440
this yourself that it's like it's like a

473
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,960
bit grotesque and some some people are

474
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,480
just inherently really into it and

475
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,279
others are just like not absolutely um I

476
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,519
mean I I now that you kind of you know

477
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,918
mention it it's it is kind of um guys

478
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,960
definitely tend to draw themselves

479
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,400
toward the the they want the funkiest

480
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,640
lead you

481
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,559
know the uh the um females that I smoke

482
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,799
with or or have in the past typically

483
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,319
tend to like Fruity genetics things that

484
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,759
aren't as offensive um you know like the

485
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,000
kkes and stuff like that um obviously

486
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,038
not exclusively but like you said it's

487
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,599
it's definitely guys like stank

488
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:30,200
weed yeah totally totally and look all

489
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll put it out there I'm I'm a fruity

490
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,640
guy myself so what does that say about

491
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,759
me I don't know okay okay okay little

492
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,799
feminine in there no no I like I like

493
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,079
Fruity I like Fruity too man I just I

494
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:43,918
like if I have my fruit in there I have

495
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,240
to have some gas to it you know

496
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,038
something that kind of like makes it not

497
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,200
just

498
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:53,079
fruit um you know but I you know I I

499
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,798
like to get some uh purple punch every

500
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,158
once in a while and you know just

501
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,679
something that tastes good that doesn't

502
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,600
necessarily like get you [ __ ]

503
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
annihilated but like it's just enjoyable

504
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,399
smoke good

505
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,840
flavor yeah totally totally all right

506
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,400
well let's let's dive into it tell me a

507
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,678
little bit about the Genesis of the GMO

508
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,240
in the sense of what was it that Drew

509
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,000
you to those seeds and how did you get

510
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,960
them you know did you have a friendship

511
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,880
with mimo did you just happen to find

512
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,840
yourself with those seeds how did it all

513
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,200
go down initially so initially mimo was

514
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,798
not even mentioned at all in it um you

515
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:31,600
got to go back this is like 2012 2011

516
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:33,759
201 12 THC farmer I'm a moderator on

517
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,959
there or was a moderator on there um

518
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:41,679
along with you know cap and all those

519
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:45,120
guys um Divine genetics was ran by Logic

520
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,840
who was the owner of THC farmer um not

521
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,519
sure if you're familiar or not um yeah

522
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,678
yeah lots of lots of bad a couple good

523
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,679
lots of bad though

524
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,798
um uh he had a bunch of seed that he

525
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,600
wanted tested

526
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,679
um so I you know I threw my hat in the

527
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,079
ring and said sure you know I'll I'll

528
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,159
run some seed I'll see I'll see what

529
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,240
it's about you know um cam D cross with

530
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,200
Girl Scout cookie Forum cut was one of

531
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,839
the crosses that landed in my lap which

532
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,400
um didn't really actually get named

533
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:23,720
until like you know probably years down

534
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:27,240
the road um did the pheno hunt didn't

535
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,558
know that he was white labeling the

536
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,400
genetics

537
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:35,440
um not until years later um like years

538
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,240
and probably almost five years later did

539
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,600
we find out that Miko made uh the seed

540
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,960
so I mean as soon as he as soon as we

541
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,439
fig you know a lot of us figured it out

542
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,079
he definitely got credit for it um but

543
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,519
logic was kind of keeping that like

544
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,158
tucked away he wasn't really letting

545
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:56,119
anybody know about it so it was kind of

546
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,039
news you know to our ears but yeah man

547
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:01,239
um the seeds wound up because they were

548
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:03,158
they were tester sees wow okay so you

549
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,120
you really got them truly early on in

550
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,559
the picture I guess yes sir like like I

551
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,759
said I think I believe it was like 2012

552
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,359
was when I got him feno hunted him right

553
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,798
away

554
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,479
um feno hunted all the seeds that he

555
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:20,679
gave me and then over the years uh ran

556
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,400
into other people that wound up buying

557
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,360
the seeds after they had been released

558
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,120
um and they they shot me the seeds that

559
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,240
they had left and everybody was

560
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,639
convinced that just you know it's

561
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,000
whatever was going to get tapped out of

562
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,600
there was tapped out of there and the

563
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,119
GMO and there was a couple others um

564
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,959
honorable mentions that I found in the

565
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:43,158
seed stock um but the GMO was definitely

566
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,919
the stand out um there was a root beer

567
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,679
feno my buddy used to say smelled like

568
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:51,000
root beer it was a it was like a stout

569
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,840
plant completely different um there was

570
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,839
a bunch of weird stuff that popped up in

571
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,959
there but you know like I said nothing

572
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,519
nothing that was do anything close to

573
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,159
GMO

574
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,400
yeah wow that's interesting as a quick

575
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,520
little digression have you ever spoke to

576
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,000
mean Jean about that because it's almost

577
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,240
coincidental that he's done some

578
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,200
pairings with his root beer in the GMO I

579
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,278
thought maybe maybe you'd spoke about

580
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,840
that with him and he thought oh I'll

581
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:16,480
pair them together no big fan of his

582
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,959
though um love his work don't know him

583
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
personally haven't really had much

584
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,720
interaction with him but yeah I saw that

585
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,880
GMO across with his root beer bx1 or or

586
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,720
whatever it was that he was working um

587
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,880
love to try those seeds haven't had the

588
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,480
chance but yeah I saw it and I was very

589
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,200
interested very intrigued in what he was

590
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,798
doing with that line wow that's some

591
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,278
synchronous stuff right there that you

592
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,798
know you sort of got a pheno like that

593
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,359
and he's sort of paired them together

594
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,599
that's cool okay well if we loop back to

595
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,278
the story I guess the question is you

596
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,038
mentioned a little earlier that you know

597
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,119
even during that first run you flowed

598
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:51,720
him out you could tell this was

599
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,158
something a bit different to the rest

600
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,798
the question is did you like you know

601
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,880
you've acknowledged you realized it was

602
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,599
different did you realize like how

603
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,480
special it was and I guess let's say

604
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,079
when you had the first or second batch

605
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,558
of flour from it what was like the

606
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,158
public SL your friend's responses did

607
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,480
they realize what it was or did it take

608
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,720
some time to catch on so that that pheno

609
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,679
hunt actually went down in the basement

610
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,400
of the house that I lived in the time

611
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,960
and uh you know used a couple carbon

612
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,519
filters but that thing was like a carbon

613
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,919
filter

614
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,839
Destroyer that one plant that one plant

615
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,919
that I had the first during the feno

616
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,199
hunt I mean I had buddies that came over

617
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
house and you know we're like dude your

618
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,840
house like stinks man like it's it's

619
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,240
worse than it usually is you know like

620
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,839
what what do you got going on down there

621
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,399
like you got something different like

622
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,199
what's up let me see what you got you

623
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:44,000
know so I I showed I showed it off a

624
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,480
little bit in the in the testing phases

625
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,079
and everybody said the same thing they

626
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,519
were just like look at the stack on that

627
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,158
thing it's throwing out like baseball

628
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:55,679
bats you know like never seen anything

629
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:58,039
like it before um it was just a unique

630
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,679
plant like from day one you know was

631
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:05,960
just so vigorous and it just it stood

632
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,038
out always and um we didn't really find

633
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,840
out how well of a Hatcher it really even

634
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,558
was until um I did you know larger rooms

635
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:14,879
and we kind of like started processing

636
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,000
it like by itself and the numbers that

637
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,880
we were getting back just like holy cow

638
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,159
the hell is going on here this thing is

639
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,799
incredible like these numbers are

640
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,120
nothing like what you know anything else

641
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,319
we're

642
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:31,158
running yeah wow just a game ch

643
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,439
so I guess the question then

644
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,919
becomes was it like a linear progression

645
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,480
did was it like everyone you showed it

646
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,840
to was interested in it was just

647
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,360
building in popularity or did it take a

648
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,439
little bit of time for it to really

649
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,798
start to spread like wildfire cuz at a

650
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,640
certain point it obviously hit critical

651
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:52,480
mass and just exploded and I'm just

652
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,960
wondering when was that so pheno hun

653
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,558
kind of started to scale it up a little

654
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,240
bit realized it was something special

655
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,319
and it could yield and we could use it

656
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:04,319
for hash making um the name itself was

657
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,519
kind of a big deal in the beginning um

658
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,720
the first places like I said Street City

659
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,278
and an Arbor Michigan here that we would

660
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,159
drop it at uh when we first dropped it

661
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:17,240
it didn't move it's sat on the Shelf huh

662
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,840
nobody you know no a lot of people

663
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,759
didn't want to touch it it's kind of a

664
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,639
kind of a vegan area kind of a hippie

665
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:27,720
area you know and uh the name was a

666
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,720
turnout for them so the owner said uh

667
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,519
you know look would you be offended if I

668
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,880
changed the name of this and I said no

669
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:37,079
absolutely not like you know if it's you

670
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,360
know not going to move I'm I'm not gonna

671
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,839
you know get you burnt here um so he

672
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,359
said what do you think about you know

673
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,678
everyone says it smells like garlic what

674
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:50,479
do you think about calling it uh garlic

675
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,759
cookies and I said you know should give

676
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,159
it a try so he did the name change and

677
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:59,038
then it just couldn't stay on a shelf it

678
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,240
just flew so the demand grew so we had

679
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,960
to produce more and then it just kind of

680
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,359
like was a Snowball Effect it just

681
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,319
became you know a huge favorite in the

682
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,199
area amongst everybody that tried it

683
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,599
just it just really started to explode

684
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,278
at that point um we just couldn't even

685
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,158
keep up with

686
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,599
demand yeah wow and I mean you touched

687
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,600
on a a point that comes up in almost

688
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,398
every website if you Google GMO which is

689
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,079
you know as you mentioned the name you

690
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:28,599
know what what did the name originally

691
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,759
mean to you and does it mean now if

692
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:34,639
that's changed at all so GMO to me was

693
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,480
just like referring to its like how just

694
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,960
wild it grew just like how how strong it

695
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,038
was you know like it grew at three times

696
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,840
the speed and veg that anything else did

697
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,519
that I had in the rooms and just how it

698
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,720
threw out these huge baseball bats you

699
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,798
know I'm like this thing's got to be

700
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,720
like you know genetically

701
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,398
modified um so I started kind of giving

702
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,880
it the nickname GMO you know it's like

703
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:01,479
joking around like this thing is you

704
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,760
know kind of a force of its own um also

705
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,880
coincidentally at the time the Girl

706
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,480
Scout uh cookies were getting like you

707
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,278
know a bunch of press in the news for

708
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,159
putting GMOs um in their in their bait

709
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:15,640
goods and stuff so it's just kind of

710
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,760
like I don't know the Universe telling

711
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:23,759
me to just call it GMO um which is

712
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:26,200
actually kind of ironic because um logic

713
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,398
was completely against and like forbid

714
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,200
me to call it GMO

715
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:34,518
and then years down the road put out GMO

716
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,399
seeds which is just I don't know I find

717
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,919
kind

718
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:40,599
ofal yeah he made him backflip on it I

719
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,679
love that I love that and I mean I guess

720
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:45,639
as a how would you phrase it a question

721
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,000
that people are probably wondering and I

722
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,480
certainly am is you know given the

723
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,839
dominant chmd profile within the GMO

724
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,079
what's your thoughts on the chmd and the

725
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,319
chem dogs in general I love the chem I

726
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,439
think the chem are amazing I mean I like

727
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,879
them on a personal level to smoke I like

728
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,759
him to use in genetic breeding I like

729
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,399
them to just grow for flower um I think

730
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,038
the chem D is

731
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:14,479
amazing

732
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:18,000
um probably my favorite chem at least to

733
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,000
grow I do like the chem 991 but the

734
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,119
whole chem line itself man is just it's

735
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,480
so strong it's so you know epic in in

736
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:29,678
genetic crosses it's just to to not like

737
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,120
would be insane to

738
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,200
me yeah no certainly certainly and I

739
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,759
mean I I was probably meant to slot this

740
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,919
in just the prior question but just to

741
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,599
100% rule it out what's your thoughts on

742
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,120
when people say that GMO stands for

743
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,879
garlic mushroom onions do you think like

744
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,639
oh it's just a funny coincidence and it

745
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,320
sort of works out or is it just like no

746
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,880
that's definitely not anything related

747
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,839
to it I think it's just funny

748
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,880
coincidence it kind of works out I mean

749
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,918
some people get garlic smell in there

750
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,000
some people get onion smell in there to

751
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,919
me it just kind of smells skunky

752
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,319
you know um definitely not what I

753
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,120
intentionally you know put the GMO you

754
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:08,639
know out there for as an acronym but um

755
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,319
I think it's cool hearing the stories of

756
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,399
people kind of like going in their own

757
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,278
Direction with it and it's probably one

758
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,398
of the most asked questions I ever get

759
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,440
is just you know did the GMOs you know

760
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,719
stand for this or me and my buddies are

761
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,798
having a debate and you know I bet him

762
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,519
that it stood for this or that and I

763
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,759
don't know it's it's fun you know I I

764
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,759
have a good time with it you know the

765
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,519
Cannabis Community reaching out and kind

766
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,558
of trying to get the the lore of the

767
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,960
Back stories of everything and you know

768
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,440
I think it's I think it's cool I enjoy

769
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,278
it people can call it whatever they want

770
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,759
but to me it's it's always just going to

771
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,159
be GMO and it's just based on how it

772
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:45,278
grows and you know my experience with it

773
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,000
but yeah that's beautiful so I mean we

774
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,159
we've sort of touched on this but I just

775
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,919
wanted to delve into the topic a little

776
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,159
more you know you referenced earlier

777
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,759
maybe there was some pollen

778
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,799
contamination or something like that but

779
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,519
I guess my question is to me the GMO

780
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,798
seems like like a lottery ticket

781
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,399
phenotype in the sense that you know as

782
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,319
you've said many people have popped

783
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,839
those seeds and no one's really found

784
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,480
anything that similar I guess the

785
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,480
question is do you feel that it's like

786
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,720
in my mind I guess maybe an analogy is I

787
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,360
feel like it's kind of similar to the

788
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,880
Mac 1 you know it's like it's this

789
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:19,158
insane cut and no one's really been able

790
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,679
to find anything that stands up to it

791
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,559
while hunting those same seeds is that

792
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,480
how you think about it or do you lean

793
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:27,879
more towards the possibility of pollen

794
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,399
contamination as opposed to like this is

795
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:34,760
just the one fer where we really locked

796
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,319
out I mean I think in my opinion I think

797
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,119
it's just something in the back genetics

798
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,879
that came out and popped out um for one

799
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,278
random seed to pop in there and just

800
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,600
kind of like be that much of a game

801
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:50,119
changer would just be I

802
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:52,599
guess to me it just not as not as

803
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,359
possible um everything to me just leans

804
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:58,798
toward just the cam is just

805
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:01,678
awesome and uh just it was just a freak

806
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,839
feno that came out and you know kind of

807
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,600
made its way and just it was meant to be

808
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,319
kind of thing you know

809
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,879
um our group kind of held it in our our

810
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,879
little circle for a while but we just

811
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,320
felt like really the world need to

812
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,440
really enjoy it you know get out there

813
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:20,398
and uh make some people's Gardens

814
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,480
happy yeah that's awesome to hear have

815
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,798
you ever made or ran any s1s from it and

816
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
found anything interesting in there so

817
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,079
the is with the GMO when you start doing

818
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,798
s1's and reversing it is obviously

819
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,839
hermod [ __ ] you know Tendencies it

820
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:38,038
wants to throw poin and the lowers from

821
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,759
seed doesn't necessarily stay in the

822
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,919
traits kind of like i' I've done some

823
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,240
s1s and um I've cloned them before I ran

824
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,399
the seed and didn't run the straight

825
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,599
seed and I didn't have the issues but

826
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,918
like you know as a breeder you can't

827
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:53,879
rely on people to do that so I've always

828
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,679
kind of like steered away from putting

829
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,399
out

830
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:02,559
s1's and do doing a lot of fem work in

831
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:05,518
general um not that fem are always going

832
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:09,720
to be you know Herm issues but something

833
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:12,278
about that particular strain um I've

834
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,240
just had issues with it with f seeds not

835
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:18,278
so much being the palen um receiver but

836
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,120
being the donor ah okay and so I guess

837
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:21,960
the flip side of that question is what

838
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,439
sort of genetics do you think the GMO

839
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,759
pairs well

840
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,278
with I like to put it with stuff that

841
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:31,000
kind of you know stays shorter stays a

842
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:33,240
little squatter though I mean I love OG

843
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,119
Kush and pairing it with OG when I when

844
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,558
I did the Han Solo Burger um was just

845
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:42,119
amazing you know but I'm a big gas fan

846
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:43,599
and I like that kind of stuff um but I

847
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:47,479
did some I did some work I did some

848
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:50,278
Urkle crosses with it um I did an obamus

849
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,639
cross um with the BX the donni burger

850
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:57,720
which is a GMO bx1 um some of those

851
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:59,119
fenos came out just incredible um

852
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,000
you know I like to pair it with stuff

853
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,638
that it's kind of like opposite of you

854
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,759
know it already has that funkiness it

855
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:09,440
already has that that wild stretch so to

856
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:12,599
pair it with something that's you know

857
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,240
kind of fruity or kind of more Stout and

858
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,879
you know has attributes that kind of

859
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,398
like mellow it out with the stretch and

860
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:22,279
everything I I found to be the most

861
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:25,118
beneficial yeah sure and I guess an

862
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,280
extension of that is what sort of traits

863
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,519
are you looking to improve so guess if

864
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,320
you had to you know be critical what do

865
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,679
you think could be better so I mean

866
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,440
everybody's everyone's complaint with

867
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,838
the GMOs it takes too long to flower um

868
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,720
which I agree with you know it does it

869
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,519
does take a long time so it kind of

870
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,239
negates the commercial standpoint of it

871
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,918
though you can run it commercially it's

872
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,519
just most people nowadays because of how

873
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,878
the industry is they want to run like

874
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,679
nine weeks and proper GMO just can't go

875
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:55,358
nine

876
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,480
weeks

877
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:02,159
um so when you when you breed with it or

878
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,519
use as a tool your main at least my main

879
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:08,598
goal is to shorten flower times which

880
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,599
I've you know I've been able to do um

881
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,680
and still be able to pull a lot of that

882
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:16,599
funk a lot of those things that people

883
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:18,480
love about the GMO it just people just

884
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:23,119
don't have the patience to run 90 days

885
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,519
85 days so definitely the time got to

886
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,000
knock that down the stretch some people

887
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,400
have an issue with it that have short

888
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
ceilings or more confined space so

889
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,880
knocking that stretch down a little bit

890
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
is is always something that I I Look to

891
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,559
accomplish when breeding with it

892
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,480
um I like to kind of like dense it up

893
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,320
don't really like to give it things that

894
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,920
have fox tail

895
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:53,039
Tendencies um the GMO can kind of fox

896
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,838
tail sometimes on its own so anything

897
00:35:53,039 --> 00:36:00,000
that can kind of like help densen it up

898
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:02,159
so basically flower time flower density

899
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,838
stretch those are like the main my main

900
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,279
concerns whenever I use it as a tool for

901
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:09,400
breeding yeah nice and I'm really Keen

902
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,720
to jump into some of the Donny Burger

903
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,920
Han Solo Burger all that sort of stuff

904
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,879
but before we get there I just want to

905
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,200
quickly ask you I read an interesting

906
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,800
comment by a good friend of the show

907
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,598
dirolf he's a well-known Canadian grower

908
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,039
and he made a comment a few weeks ago

909
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,800
that sort of stuck with me which was I'm

910
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,318
paraphrasing but essentially he said you

911
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,400
know GMO has done more for the Canadian

912
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,920
cannibis scene than any other strain

913
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,800
since breeda Steve sweet skunk which

914
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,599
obviously you know made a big splash

915
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,480
many years ago have you heard sentiments

916
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,800
to this effect and how does it feel to

917
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,159
be associated with a strain that's has

918
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,760
such far reaching impacts in a you know

919
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,598
a place like Canada which is you know

920
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,440
well-known cannabis

921
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,440
producer H I think it's amazing I think

922
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,119
it's amazing that I was able to be part

923
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,838
of that and just you know I didn't I

924
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,358
didn't breed it I just selected I just

925
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,719
found it I'm just the the person that

926
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,559
bought the lottery ticket that you know

927
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:04,118
hit a jackpot so to speak but um being a

928
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,719
part of that

929
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:09,480
and being able to share that and and

930
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:12,239
hearing people's stories about how it's

931
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,920
changed the industry in such a positive

932
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,159
way especially like I said you know

933
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,639
these these guys that are big hashers

934
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,399
and make a lot of rosin and you know all

935
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:24,078
these concentrates and just hearing

936
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,000
their stories about just how it's

937
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:31,359
changed their lives financially just

938
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,920
like personally it's just it's amazing

939
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm so proud and happy to be a part of

940
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,318
that and just be part of the story you

941
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,000
know just to be somebody that

942
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:42,279
contributed to it it's just fills me

943
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,400
with

944
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,960
joy ah humble man I love it I love it

945
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,318
all righty well let's jump in to some

946
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,119
more breeding stuff but before that take

947
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,960
me back tell me about your first

948
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,039
experience with

949
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,480
cannabis um started smoking at a young

950
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:04,838
age um

951
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,519
the first time I smoked I knew that it

952
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:10,519
was going to be something important in

953
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:15,639
my life um it just like had this hold on

954
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:17,599
me where it was really calming and it

955
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:19,159
just went along with a certain type of

956
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,079
lifestyle that I knew I wanted to be a

957
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:27,838
part of and I just just haven't really

958
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:30,720
put it down um since you know suffer a

959
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,559
short little period with uh with the

960
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,358
court system

961
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,759
but besides that it's just been a been a

962
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:41,318
constant in my life man and you know

963
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,200
I've I've feel like it's just changed me

964
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:46,039
for the

965
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,919
better yeah wow that's awesome to hear

966
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,318
that you had that connection with it so

967
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,240
early on when you first started smoking

968
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:54,519
was this at a time frame when like there

969
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,159
was strain names or was it before that

970
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,480
and do you remember the sort of effects

971
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,318
you were feeling when you were first

972
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,358
starting

973
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:03,960
smoking so like I'm decently old not

974
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:05,039
super old in the community the majority

975
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,480
of the peers like you know all the

976
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:11,039
Breeders and stuff I'm I'm in my late

977
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:15,519
30s so the peak I guess when I started

978
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:17,519
was like 99 you know um we weren't

979
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,639
really getting genetics that had like

980
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,639
full-on names they would come around

981
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,960
every once in a while but the area that

982
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,159
I'm at wasn't really like a cannabis

983
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,838
Capital here in Michigan

984
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,559
um we would get stuff like northern

985
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:32,639
lights every once in a while from like

986
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,199
older smokers some skunk skunk was

987
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:39,000
really big in Michigan here um if you

988
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:41,039
could get your hands on it but couple

989
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,559
years maybe into smoking we started to

990
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,199
see um some of my buddies like older

991
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,599
brothers and stuff started doing little

992
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,598
closet grows and go to like Amsterdam

993
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,559
and bring back seed and some of the some

994
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:58,680
of the early centy stuff and and serious

995
00:39:53,559 --> 00:40:01,199
seed stuff like AK-47 and um sensey star

996
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:03,919
I remember being just like amazing where

997
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,480
it was just like once you got your hands

998
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,358
on that like you're like I'm not I'm not

999
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,240
smoking this uh you know offbrand

1000
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:12,480
whatever it is like this is this is all

1001
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:15,118
I want now this is it's a game changer

1002
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,719
it's just you know unique and the highs

1003
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,519
are different and they're exciting and

1004
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:23,439
yeah

1005
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,039
just early on you know it's just they we

1006
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,440
didn't have what people have now with

1007
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,000
this variety and the accessibility you

1008
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,240
know I'm I'm sure that you can probably

1009
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,199
somewhat relate to that um I'm not sure

1010
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,439
how available genetics are there in

1011
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:41,719
Australia but um you know it's it's to

1012
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,200
grow up in an era where you had to seek

1013
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,759
really good weed and it wasn't always

1014
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:47,480
available and then to have what we have

1015
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,599
now here where you can just walk into a

1016
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,679
store and pick off of a menu it's just

1017
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,318
how times have

1018
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:59,318
changed yeah hugely hugely I mean yeah

1019
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:01,318
paradigm shift for sure so I guess then

1020
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,838
I'm interested to know what was the

1021
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:06,079
progression from you know having the

1022
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,279
first few encounters with it realizing

1023
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,079
this is something you're highly into to

1024
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,839
then progressing to your first grow do

1025
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,839
you remember that and what you were

1026
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:19,119
growing absolutely so I went to Jamaica

1027
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:22,279
on a trip and got to tour some really

1028
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,440
cool ganja Fields out there um found

1029
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,640
some seeds and some

1030
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:32,039
buds uh brought him back horrifyingly

1031
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,000
brought him back and uh built this

1032
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,960
little

1033
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,358
box um and just did my first grow with a

1034
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,838
400 light bulb and it was just like I I

1035
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:44,799
didn't even think about it it just came

1036
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,400
naturally or it was just like you know

1037
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,880
nothing that anybody I knew was doing at

1038
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,680
the time no one was no one was growing

1039
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,000
any flowers I was you know 18 years old

1040
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,480
and it was just something that people

1041
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,280
weren't really talking about there

1042
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,760
wasn't even like grow supply stores you

1043
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,800
could walk into and just openly talk

1044
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,200
like you can now um so it was

1045
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,280
like you know was kind of difficult it

1046
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,399
was you know internet wasn't even

1047
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,880
something that you know people were

1048
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,880
really much using at the time it was you

1049
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,559
know just starting to get where you know

1050
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,318
forums were you know getting formed and

1051
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,558
people were talking about it openly like

1052
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:24,719
on the internet it was it was a lot more

1053
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,519
difficult to start back then

1054
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,318
um but it was progression was was

1055
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:31,838
constant it was just a flow just

1056
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,800
something that naturally I wanted to get

1057
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,960
involved in and seek out other people

1058
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,599
that were doing the same thing

1059
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,440
like-minded people and kind of led me to

1060
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,960
like I see mag and and you know THC

1061
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,559
farmer and stuff like that um where I

1062
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,159
could just interact with other people

1063
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,359
that were going through the same stuff

1064
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:51,440
and could relate to what I was trying to

1065
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,880
accomplish and give me ideas and we

1066
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,159
could just kind of like feed off of each

1067
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,400
other

1068
00:42:54,159 --> 00:43:00,838
and it was it was a unique thing to

1069
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,440
experience um growing flower when nobody

1070
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:05,960
else in the area did you know now it's

1071
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,119
you know everybody's involved some way

1072
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:13,519
in either cultivation or cannabis

1073
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:16,480
and it just wasn't the case back

1074
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:19,519
then yeah totally everyone's a cannabis

1075
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,240
consultant these days aren't they

1076
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:27,079
um so tell me what was the first plant

1077
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,759
you grew where like it was like a stand

1078
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,160
out you know I remember the I remember

1079
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,680
when I first started growing you know a

1080
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,358
lot of the plants were pretty midy and

1081
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,598
it was mostly because of my skill but I

1082
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:38,838
do remember a plant you know tolerating

1083
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,559
my my horrible grow Styles and still

1084
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,239
producing a nice sort of crop and you're

1085
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:46,400
like oh some plants produce really good

1086
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:47,879
bud what was that moment like for you I

1087
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,039
started growing with this group of guys

1088
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,440
in Detroit um they were doing Warehouse

1089
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:56,679
grows um they had already developed

1090
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,280
their own kind of tech I went along with

1091
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:01,679
um they were growing this strain that we

1092
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,079
just called the per it wasn't the same

1093
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:07,519
as the seed bank perss it was what I was

1094
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,640
told years later was something called

1095
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:13,318
Green Cross or something which is kind

1096
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:17,358
of you know hilarious considering it was

1097
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:21,358
pure purple but um they were doing like

1098
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:24,598
one gallon pots like 40 of them per 4x4

1099
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:27,078
just packed side by side growing like

1100
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,240
single colas

1101
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:32,400
and I knew if I had gotten my hands on

1102
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,399
it that I could kind of develop a better

1103
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,280
method and grow it more efficiently and

1104
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,838
better and I did not that it was like

1105
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,920
you know a game Cher but um you know

1106
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:48,199
just doing a scrog of just one gallons

1107
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:52,119
was just not not the method but that was

1108
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:55,159
my first like obtained clone that was

1109
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,119
like something special that I could do

1110
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,799
you know

1111
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,039
different types of grows with and and

1112
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,359
kind of like document it and kind of

1113
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:08,400
figure it out and play with it and you

1114
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:11,119
know screen grows and and you know dwc

1115
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,000
grows and when you

1116
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,599
know Hydroponics and all that stuff you

1117
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,159
know first kind of like I got introduced

1118
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,680
to that it was unique seeing the

1119
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:23,199
differences but I wanted being a soil

1120
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:26,719
grower and stayed with organic soil for

1121
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:28,039
for a lot of years and um

1122
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,799
that's pretty much where I stayed for a

1123
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:31,358
long time until I switched over to Coco

1124
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,200
and I didn't switch over to Coco until

1125
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,239
like I don't even know maybe maybe four

1126
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:38,439
years ago or five years ago but yeah

1127
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,558
that that one per that one purple strain

1128
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:44,159
was definitely um the one early on that

1129
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:45,400
kind of changeed the game for me open

1130
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,679
some

1131
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,240
doors yeah incredible incredible okay

1132
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,919
and do you remember in your early years

1133
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:54,759
I think a lot of people you know we end

1134
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,680
up getting these seed addictions and we

1135
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,000
end up buying lots of and lots of seeds

1136
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:01,199
what sort of stuff were you buying oh

1137
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,159
man I was buying

1138
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,639
everything seeds were like my I don't

1139
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,199
even know they were like by drug I would

1140
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,039
just anytime that seed drops would

1141
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:12,118
happen and I was following them I just I

1142
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:15,400
had to I I still to this day have seeds

1143
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,920
that I bought like you know 15 plus

1144
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,639
years ago that are just sitting in the

1145
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,960
refrigerator that I just never did

1146
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,639
anything with it was just like a it was

1147
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,838
like a habit you know it's like got to

1148
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:26,039
have these seeds these are these are

1149
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:27,599
going to be these are going to be the

1150
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:29,480
ones and you know some of them touched

1151
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,079
and got into and some of them are still

1152
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,800
sitting there just waiting to be messed

1153
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,200
with I like to go down little Memory

1154
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,318
Lane every once in a while and open up

1155
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:37,919
the fridge and go through all the

1156
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:40,039
containers of seeds that I have and but

1157
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,838
I was I was buying up you know earlier

1158
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:44,119
days I was getting a bunch of like centy

1159
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:47,519
seed stuff and you

1160
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,960
know uh Syria seeds Flying Dutchmen you

1161
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,960
know I was getting stuff over from like

1162
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,318
Europe and then um once the Forum days

1163
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,159
kind of started you know these this OG

1164
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,679
Kush kind of wave started and you were

1165
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:00,519
just looking for things that had like OG

1166
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,919
Kush in them or you know Bubba Kush in

1167
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:05,239
them or any of the chem if you're lucky

1168
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,760
enough to get anything with cemin it and

1169
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:10,639
you know um which is the whole just

1170
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,079
buying seeds and bulk thing was just

1171
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,799
kind of like why I started making my own

1172
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,880
seeds because it was just I I was

1173
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,280
Finding not great representation of what

1174
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,318
I was really looking for in seed form so

1175
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,119
it kind of like mentally put me in this

1176
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,599
position where I'm like you know I need

1177
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:29,400
to I need to start doing some creating I

1178
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:32,838
need to you know get my get my hand in

1179
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:36,160
some of this genetic stuff and

1180
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:39,159
uh kind of changed you know me buying

1181
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,358
seed to trading seed and kind of things

1182
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:41,558
kind of went in a you know different

1183
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,960
directions from

1184
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,319
there yeah so tell me about it what was

1185
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,720
your first Endeavor with

1186
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:51,880
breeding I was playing around with male

1187
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,759
plants kind of trying to you know

1188
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,838
understand you know how dropping pollen

1189
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,079
and and what kind of traits you know

1190
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:02,838
plants put out or gave indic you know

1191
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,760
looking for indicators stem rug and you

1192
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,759
know stressing out plans to kind of play

1193
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,440
with them see what it made it do and you

1194
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,720
know starve them out or don't give them

1195
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,358
water for a little while and kind of

1196
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,919
drought them out and see what kind of

1197
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,279
Expressions come out with them see if

1198
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,159
they you know makes them drop pollen and

1199
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,559
you know my whole thing my whole

1200
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:22,920
breeding experience is all it's all

1201
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,280
based on trial and error you know I'll

1202
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,240
make things and and they'll be awesome

1203
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,839
you know make things and they're [ __ ]

1204
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,279
terrible and you know it's like it's all

1205
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:33,558
just like a constant learning experience

1206
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,160
for me and it's a you know there's a big

1207
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:36,839
learning curve to the whole breeding

1208
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:39,358
thing and and just growing in general

1209
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:44,159
and I don't think you can grow unless

1210
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:47,358
you have failure and just breeding even

1211
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,759
more so like like I've been work I

1212
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,480
worked at Larry line still work in the

1213
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,599
same Larry line um for like 10 plus

1214
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,880
years and I had certain Generations that

1215
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,920
I you know made and and went back

1216
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,280
because I wasn't I wasn't happy with how

1217
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,400
you know The Offspring was so I mean

1218
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,079
even to this day I still make plenty of

1219
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,280
error like constant error but you know I

1220
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:12,359
pride myself in you know when I have

1221
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:14,359
success in it and you know it's it would

1222
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:18,000
be naive to think that everything that

1223
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:21,039
is ever made is is going to be you know

1224
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,880
awesome yeah sure look you touched on

1225
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,599
the the Larry and that was certainly

1226
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,920
something I was hoping for us to delve

1227
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,119
into you know wanted to first off start

1228
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,760
by asking where did the passion for the

1229
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,640
Larry OG come from well a lot of the

1230
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,160
passion came from it being the only OG I

1231
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:36,159
could get my hands

1232
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,440
on so kind of wanted being the leading

1233
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:44,838
horse there in the uh in the race but um

1234
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,838
luckily I mean the Larry is epic like

1235
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:49,279
it's it's a great OG cush like I wish I

1236
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:50,960
still had the original cuddle Larry i'

1237
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,240
would be thrilled to have the original

1238
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:58,760
Larry um pretty much worked it into a

1239
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:01,239
solid SE and something like basically

1240
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,079
spot on or close to pops up on a regular

1241
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,118
basis for me

1242
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:09,519
but it was definitely like you know it

1243
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,680
was my first dealings with OG Kush the

1244
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:15,000
first genetic that I got in physical

1245
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:17,558
form of of a clone of OG Kush and I just

1246
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,679
love the plant so much and you know I

1247
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:22,240
was lucky enough to get it have a real

1248
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,078
version of it and it kind of just like

1249
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:25,239
made it in no Briner for me like that it

1250
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,240
was going to be something that I worked

1251
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:31,919
with and uh early on in the game I was

1252
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:33,039
blessed enough to um kind of get to know

1253
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,880
Elite

1254
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,798
genetics and he was also a big Larry fan

1255
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,480
um he had worked something that he was

1256
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:44,679
calling the lemon Larry which was Larry

1257
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,719
OG Kush crossed with sour diesel IBL

1258
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:50,960
from um res

1259
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:53,838
seeds uh he passed me some of the seeds

1260
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,318
uh to work with so I was able to do like

1261
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:59,759
a little BX across the uh mail that I

1262
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:03,759
found from his seed stack to the Larry

1263
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,720
clone only um making the first VX and

1264
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,240
then uh I just worked you know FG from

1265
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:12,239
that point on and and you know finished

1266
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,798
up

1267
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,479
f10s and you know I'm still going to

1268
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:19,599
continue to work the line until I don't

1269
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,838
know just probably forever it's just

1270
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,720
such a great line it's it's amazing um

1271
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:28,679
the the outcrosses that I've made from

1272
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,838
it people loved it's just uh it's

1273
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:31,598
something that's special to me as a

1274
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:34,239
reader it's just I put a lot of time and

1275
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,200
work into it so um I'll probably always

1276
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,039
continue align to

1277
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:41,798
that ah that that's awesome to hear and

1278
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:44,599
I I read on your website that you'd sort

1279
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:46,599
of um you know briefly discuss this

1280
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:48,720
experience where you got to try this

1281
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:51,000
legendary OG while you're on Venice

1282
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,798
Beach do you think that was the

1283
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,559
Larry I think that was probably just the

1284
00:51:53,798 --> 00:52:01,559
original OG um grown really well by

1285
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:03,599
somebody there in Southern California

1286
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:08,280
um

1287
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:11,880
I've grown the original just briefly um

1288
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,839
I just I just got it back from Josh um

1289
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,880
him and I are actually uh working on a

1290
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:20,599
collab project together an OG project um

1291
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,039
so it should be cool to see how the

1292
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,359
original which I think is what they were

1293
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:29,079
calling the Venice OG um grown locally

1294
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:32,519
in the area of Venice at the time um how

1295
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:34,000
that grows and and contrast to you know

1296
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:35,599
being hit with the lar that I've worked

1297
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,599
on for so long and seeing what kind of

1298
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,960
Expressions come out of that what kind

1299

1309
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:04,000
lovely you know just really easy to talk

to guy so definitely shout out joshd I

1311
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,280
got a question that's more of a personal

1312
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:10,480
one for me than anything else but years

1313
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,040
ago probably at least 10 years ago I

1314
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,440
tried some lario that was imported Bud

1315
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,558
from the States you know came to

1316
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,679
Australia and I remember thinking you

1317
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,040
know it had this sour lemon sort of

1318
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:23,480
flavor to it and then years later I

1319
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:25,838
tried Larry OG at Mr Bob hemp's house

1320
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,639
and it was like the original OG and I

1321
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:30,119
was like oh this isn't lemony like the

1322
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:31,639
one I tried years ago and then you know

1323
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,798
as you've sort of touched on you hear

1324
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:34,879
that there's this other one you know

1325
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:37,318
this electric lemon Larry it's got a few

1326
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,200
different names do you think that that

1327
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,039
ex that is the explanation for the

1328
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,719
experience I had I probably just tried

1329
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:46,119
the electric lemon and the original

1330
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:48,118
Larry OG is more like the original OG

1331
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:50,760
where it's like an earthy cushy like not

1332
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,400
really a lemon thing or any explanation

1333
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,160
for maybe how I had those two different

1334
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,119
experiences yeah I mean I've gone back

1335
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:59,519
back and forth with a few people on this

1336
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,400
and the original is just a lot a lot

1337
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:05,960
more rare than people would think it is

1338
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:09,480
there's a lot of um seed genetics that

1339
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:13,920
have been created I know swerve did um

1340
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:16,559
did a Larry uh bx2 or something um years

1341
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,838
back and some of those phenos that

1342
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:23,040
people found were getting pasted as the

1343
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:25,719
Larry um I know that some of Elites from

1344
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,759
Elite genetics I know that some of his

1345
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:29,719
seeds that he made of the lemon Larry

1346
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,799
were getting tossed around is just Larry

1347
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:34,318
clone only um so most likely I mean if

1348
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:35,920
my opinion it would probably be one of

1349
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,199
those type of situations where if you

1350
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,440
got something that was truly like

1351
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:42,000
lemony then it was probably like had

1352
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,280
some some of that sour diesel or

1353
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,760
something in it you know that gave it

1354
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,599
kind of that twist it does it does have

1355
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,040
like a little bit of a a more citrus

1356
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,798
than you know the original but it still

1357
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,920
has that classic OG to it you know what

1358
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:58,719
I mean it's it's it's not like candy

1359
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,200
coated typee of thing it's more like a

1360
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:05,919
mouth coating cush that has like that

1361
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:08,960
little slight like electrified kind of

1362
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,838
you know little lemon to it it's very

1363
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,599
very light though it's it's not like the

1364
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:15,880
lemon Larry or the one that swerved in

1365
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,318
but there was and I know because i' I've

1366
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,519
gotten past a couple Larry's that I've

1367
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:23,199
grown out and was like you know this

1368
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:26,920
isn't the original one this is one of

1369
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:29,038
the ones from seed um so I think there's

1370
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,358
a lot of that going on or was going on

1371
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,200
there for a period of time uh I don't

1372
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:36,519
really see the Larry popup at all

1373
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:38,000
anymore um there's been a couple people

1374
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:40,559
I've talked to recently that have been

1375
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,798
like on a you know wild Witch Hunt for

1376
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,000
this alleged you know real Larry and I

1377
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:48,239
don't know I've I haven't been able to

1378
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,159
you know track it down myself and grow

1379
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:53,919
it and get a get a real version of it

1380
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:57,879
so it's out there somewhere somebody has

1381
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:00,000
it but probably the difference that

1382
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,519
you're seeing is that the one later on

1383
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,119
down the road that you tried out that

1384
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:05,639
was more like the original that was

1385
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,160
probably the real lar and the ones from

1386
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:13,000
the earlier days were were crosses is

1387
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:15,639
what I would probably best uh gas on

1388
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,838
that yeah okay cool that that certainly

1389
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:19,960
makes sense in my mind so I'd love to

1390
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:21,960
hear a little bit more about your Larry

1391
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,599
OG line and some of the specifics about

1392
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,798
it because we did have some fans

1393
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,760
submitted questions and I guess one of

1394
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:29,318
the obvious things that jumps out to

1395
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,680
most people is that you've bred it a

1396
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:34,519
number of filial generations I think as

1397
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,759
you mentioned up to the F10 the question

1398
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:38,920
is what sort of traits were you looking

1399
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,599
to preserve and what sort how would you

1400
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,639
describe the plants that you'd get from

1401
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,400
that line in general the the seed line

1402
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,679
as opposed to the Clone so what I was

1403
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,280
really trying to do is just kind of

1404
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:53,879
capture the original into seed form um I

1405
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,798
wasn't really trying to necessarily in

1406
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:59,119
the beginning

1407
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:01,920
um add anything to it or strengthen it

1408
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,880
in any ways um I guess maybe like

1409
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,079
subconsciously I would select you know

1410
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,798
plants by structure that had better node

1411
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:10,079
spacing than the original the original

1412
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,719
kind of you know has a little bit of

1413
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,960
lengthiness to it um maybe I was doing a

1414
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,879
little bit of that subconsciously but it

1415
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,519
was really trying to just lock down the

1416
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,200
original and um you know just in case

1417
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:25,239
down the road I kind of lost it which

1418
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:26,719
you know it's exactly what happen um I

1419
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:28,558
could kind of like pop seed and just

1420
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,558
kind of you know start over again you

1421
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,960
know

1422
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,960
um

1423
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,838
definitely think that some of the

1424
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,119
generations that I ran through some of

1425
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:43,679
the sour popped up in and I would get

1426
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:48,400
phenos that ranged almost on the diesel

1427
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:50,598
side um the f6s that I made I got a lot

1428
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,440
of sour in them and even some like

1429
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,720
purpling that came in which was kind of

1430
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,838
different than some of the other

1431
00:57:53,719 --> 00:58:00,078
Generations but but

1432
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:02,599
um the f7s were the ones that I started

1433
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,960
doing out crossbreeding with the f8s

1434
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:06,640
were more public ones that I did drops

1435
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,838
with

1436
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:12,920
um it's like I said it's probably really

1437
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:15,440
just like the goal was to get that and

1438
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,440
just lock it in in seed

1439
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,639
form yeah and and would you say that in

1440
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,480
general you feel like you've been able

1441
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,519
to do that or do you feel like each

1442
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,599
generation sort of represents the Clone

1443
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:28,960
in a slightly different

1444
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:31,640
way um I think I've been able to do it

1445
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,798
for the most part I mean there's there's

1446
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:38,318
certain Generations that I I favor just

1447
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:41,440
because I like you know how they are but

1448
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:44,920
um the last ones the last two the the

1449
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,159
f8s were pretty locked in there wasn't a

1450
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,240
whole lot of variation really at all um

1451
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:53,118
there wasn't any sours that came up the

1452
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:57,038
f9s were just like amazing they were you

1453
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:59,599
know straight OG push like every plant

1454
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,599
looked very similar there was no you

1455
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,359
know massive nug fenos or no sour fenos

1456
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:07,119
or nothing weird that was popping up it

1457
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:09,279
was you know it was real uniform where

1458
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:12,079
you know as it should be you know that

1459
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,720
far work down the line um but it's

1460
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,440
surprising even when you inbreed some

1461
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:16,919
stuff that far like you know you get

1462
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,119
some things that pop up every once in a

1463
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,798
while especially if you're popping

1464
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,920
enough seed and and looking through

1465
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:25,038
things properly you know some of the

1466
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,880
back genetics that'll come up in it and

1467
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,400
it's

1468
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:32,760
just I mean at this

1469
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:36,318
point it's just keeping the gene alive

1470
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,319
and kind of preserving it it's just for

1471
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:39,838
fun it's not like you know I'm trying to

1472
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,719
accomplish anything more at this point

1473
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,199
with it but um the outcrops are really

1474
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,919
what what really exciteed me about that

1475
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:51,558
Larry line and um look forward to kind

1476
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:56,280
of like what that can mix with the whole

1477
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:59,079
Josh collab and you know it's just uh an

1478
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,039
honor to be a part of the OG Kush thing

1479
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:03,839
and trying to make my way with that like

1480
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,920
like I did with the GMO you know yeah

1481
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:08,679
nice and I mean you just sort of touched

1482
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,039
on it there what was the first outcross

1483
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:14,639
you did with it that really got you

1484
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:19,599
excited um I had did a

1485
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:23,639
chem4 uh cross with Larry OG and that

1486
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:26,599
was just like so unique and it drew like

1487
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:30,199
different types of hems in the phenos

1488
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:33,119
that were like ranging from just huge

1489
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:34,679
flowering um plants just covered in

1490
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:39,599
resin

1491
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:42,519
to just gas and just it was just amazing

1492
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:46,359
the chems in the ogs mesh very well

1493
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:51,199
together um in my experience they have

1494
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:54,239
um I did some other OG C I did the TK I

1495
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,558
used the TK and cross it with the Larry

1496
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:58,439
um

1497
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:00,079
the Louie a lot of the ogs that were

1498
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,400
around

1499
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,680
um I just thought you know like what

1500
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,519
could go wrong mixing an OG with an OG

1501
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:10,399
and some of them did well some of them

1502
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:12,000
didn't do as well as the other ones um

1503
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,519
but yeah lots of exciting stuff when you

1504
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,480
work with those you know types of

1505
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:18,159
genetics the kushes and and the Bubbas

1506
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:21,599
and that stuff what kind of pops

1507
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:23,558
out yeah for sure and I mean in general

1508
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,519
would you say there's a certain type of

1509
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,000
plant that you're all line pairs well

1510
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,798
with or is it more of like a case by

1511
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,838
case

1512
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:33,838
basis it's kind of case by case you know

1513
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:36,199
I mean I obviously like tend to want to

1514
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:40,480
breed with plants that I enjoy

1515
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:45,598
smoking so um you know I've done a bunch

1516
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:48,480
of work with Bubbas and and kkes and um

1517
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,480
drape ape and you know just some of this

1518
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,119
some of the older Classics you know and

1519
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,519
um I'm glad I did because some of them I

1520
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:58,559
don't even have anymore

1521
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:01,038
um but I wouldn't say it necessarily

1522
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,599
pairs better with

1523
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:08,680
some but I did do a early on super

1524
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:10,440
silver haze cross and um it did not

1525
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:12,358
really pair well the fenos kind of like

1526
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,519
were all over the place and I just

1527
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:15,480
didn't really find anything that I

1528
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:18,440
really enjoyed and wanted to

1529
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:21,159
keep ah okay that's interesting that's

1530
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,720
cool I guess as a as a general question

1531
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:24,199
you know when we when we talk to

1532
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,798
breeders you know we often talk about

1533
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:29,038
the crosses that work but you you

1534
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,400
interestingly have touched on a topic we

1535
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,599
sometimes discuss which is that

1536
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,599
sometimes crosses don't work and I guess

1537
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:37,160
as a general sort of discussion you know

1538
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,000
how often do you find that's the case do

1539
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:40,879
you find that most of the time crosses

1540
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,039
work and it's only rarely you have to

1541
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,039
sort of be like you know what this one

1542
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:47,839
didn't quite work out or is it a bit

1543
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:50,799
more even across the board so like I I

1544
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:54,519
gauge what I'm going to you know drop to

1545
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:56,759
people and release um and offer publicly

1546
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:59,838
based on my testing experiences with

1547
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:02,599
with the crosses so I mean sometimes

1548
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:05,639
I'll run 20 seeds sometimes I'll run you

1549
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:10,798
know 100 seeds depending on the cross

1550
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:13,239
and um some things just don't work and

1551
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:15,599
like I have a huge stock of things that

1552
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:17,239
I'll never release because I did not

1553
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:21,079
find them to be good at

1554
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:23,038
all and like I'll never revisit some

1555
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:25,760
things you know like there's just it's

1556
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:28,960
like a a lesson learn

1557
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:32,160
just super skunk I did a couple Super

1558
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:36,920
Skunk crosses with the Larry um didn't

1559
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:39,038
enjoy any of those um years back when I

1560
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,200
still had the mass Super

1561
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:45,520
Skunk those plants just the structure on

1562
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:47,838
them just was not like desirable at all

1563
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,960
like from a grower standpoint

1564
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,278
cultivating them they were just branches

1565
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:55,000
flapping all over the place

1566
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:57,318
and just just wasn't something I would I

1567
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,318
would ever you know pass out even for

1568
01:03:57,318 --> 01:04:02,000
free like just just waste of time or so

1569
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:04,599
I mean I've I've definitely had plenty

1570
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,119
of trial and error and plenty of

1571
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:10,920
error which is kind of like you know

1572
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:13,880
obviously helped with you know success

1573
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,920
because I know what not to

1574
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,440
do so yeah there's there's definitely

1575
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,960
plenty of crosses that went bad no I

1576
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,480
love that I'm going to steal that phrase

1577
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,440
you know I've trial an error and I've

1578
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,358
also just had error that's a good

1579
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,440
um you mentioned the mass Super Skunk

1580
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,400
you know recently we've had a few

1581
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,400
episodes sort of with discussions around

1582
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,680
that featuring skunk VA and Staten

1583
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:38,838
Island um how would you describe the

1584
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:43,199
mass Super Skunk you were familiar with

1585
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:46,440
um it wasn't so much like on the rotten

1586
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:49,358
skunky kind of side of things um it

1587
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,200
wasn't sweet either but it just it

1588
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,798
tasted really good it had a really good

1589
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,358
turine profile to it um it yielded

1590
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:58,920
really well they kind of grew in like

1591
01:04:55,358 --> 01:05:02,119
this kind of crazy Bush um I haven't

1592
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,559
seen that plant in probably a decade

1593
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:07,400
it's probably been about 10 years since

1594
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:11,160
I've had it um but yeah it's it's you

1595
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,838
know it's not what people think of when

1596
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:15,879
they think of like a roadkill or

1597
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:17,599
something like that but um it was a

1598
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,960
unique one it was a fun one to play

1599
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:23,000
around with sure I can see where like I

1600
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,639
can see like where like the jel and and

1601
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,599
some of that stuff you know like I can

1602
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:30,239
see the relation in that line yeah nice

1603
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:33,278
okay and and have you ever been in

1604
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:35,118
search for the the roadkill like Sama or

1605
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:37,599
has it not quite piqued your curiosity

1606
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,880
in the same way yeah I mean being from

1607
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,798
Michigan we used to have tons of

1608
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,160
roadkill skunk here that's kind of like

1609
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:47,838
what I grew up smoking like when I got

1610
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:49,920
good flowers um I just I I have not been

1611
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,440
able to find it it's something that's I

1612
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,519
haven't like gone out of my way like in

1613
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:57,039
a crazy way to try to find it but it's

1614
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:58,559
not something that I think is kind of

1615
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,920
just like floating around anymore I

1616
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,440
think maybe maybe some old heads kind of

1617
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:05,200
keeping it close maybe but I mean I've

1618
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,079
had discussions with a lot of people in

1619
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,598
the industry and everyone's kind of like

1620
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:10,640
leaning toward the same thing as me it's

1621
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:13,318
like maybe that phenotype has been kind

1622
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:15,679
of like isolated away or something and

1623
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:17,838
just people didn't find it desirable for

1624
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,719
a period of time when you know growing

1625
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:22,639
wasn't legal and you know people were

1626
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,278
worried about you know smell issues and

1627
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:26,798
stuff like that it kind of maybe just

1628
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:28,318
kind of faded and took like a back seat

1629
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,599
hopefully it's around somewhere because

1630
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,838
I know that you know people would just

1631
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:34,480
love to have that in seed form and and

1632
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:38,078
have somebody that's working with it and

1633
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,838
breeding with it but you know it's

1634
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,400
something I think is kind of rare now I

1635
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:46,038
don't I don't know I haven't seen it in

1636
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:48,798
years probably 2004 2005

1637
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:50,839
maybe and and what was your recollection

1638
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:52,559
of it because you know some of the more

1639
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:54,639
modern accounts we get from people who

1640
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,319
are really on the search for it they'll

1641
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:59,118
say oh you know I found something that's

1642
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:02,000
kind of similar but potency is really

1643
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:04,160
not there do you remember it as a potent

1644
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
strain or was this back in the time

1645
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:08,519
where you know weed was scarce and so

1646
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,159
maybe tolerances were a bit lower and

1647
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:12,239
you know I guess maybe if I just still

1648
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,920
this question down do you think it is

1649
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,278
that mythical hype thing that some

1650
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,200
people make it out to be or do you think

1651
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:19,079
there's an element of like reminiscent

1652
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,679
Rose shade sort of

1653
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:22,880
glasses I mean if I'm being honest I

1654
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:24,519
think it's like a reminiscent thing

1655
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,318
where it's just like you're

1656
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:30,239
you have this concept or this idea of of

1657
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:31,798
something that really wasn't what it was

1658
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,278
you know I think I think that stunk

1659
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,480
smell was tremendous I remember like

1660
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:38,760
smoking a joint and just wreaking to

1661
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,278
high hell of skunk and it just like

1662
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,440
would not come out of your clothes and

1663
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:46,920
just like if if you had like a gram or a

1664
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:49,000
couple grams in a in a little baggie

1665
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,519
that you could smell it like when

1666
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
somebody walked into a room you know

1667
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:54,719
they were had they had the skunk on them

1668
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,880
it was just stuck to the stuck to the

1669
01:07:54,719 --> 01:08:01,199
sandwich bag resinous funky but I don't

1670
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,599
think that the high was probably

1671
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:05,519
incredibly like Earth shattering

1672
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,240
compared to some of the stuff that's

1673
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:11,920
available now um I think that part of

1674
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:16,238
it's kind of like mythical in the sense

1675
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:18,798
um my tolerance was not incredible then

1676
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:21,278
I was young I have been experienced at

1677
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,158
that point a bunch of different kinds of

1678
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,239
cannabis and what cannabis really had to

1679
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:27,879
offer so to me it was shatteringly

1680
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:31,119
strong it was it was just wreck your

1681
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:33,239
world type of thing but in comparison to

1682
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:35,880
you know what something that's you know

1683
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:38,718
10% or 12% or something you know like

1684
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,159
it's in the world of lab testing and all

1685
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,520
this stuff that you know everybody so

1686
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,479
concerned about THC content percentages

1687
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,960
and everything I don't think that it

1688
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:50,198
would be something that

1689
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:53,158
would basically like dominate records

1690
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:54,599
you know I think it was just good at

1691
01:08:53,158 --> 01:08:57,198
that time

1692
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,480
because it's what was available and and

1693
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,278
that was the best of it you

1694
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:03,879
know yeah certainly that that all makes

1695
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:05,759
sense and that that correlates with some

1696
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,039
of the accounts I've heard from other

1697
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,640
people you you touched on a number of

1698
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:11,278
really interesting talking points in

1699
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,600
that answer so I would love to touch on

1700
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,960
a few of them and the first being you

1701
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:18,279
know the THC percentage predicament

1702
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,399
which is a bit of a tongue tire so you

1703
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:22,080
know there's like a bit of a common

1704
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:24,599
sentiment in the community that uh you

1705
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,238
know we're too Dominator by THC

1706
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,000
percentages and I guess more

1707
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:30,919
specifically there's this push that we

1708
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,560
need to try to educate consumers to to

1709
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,520
not focus on it so much I guess the

1710
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,719
question is do you think it's possible

1711
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,799
to do this or do you think that the

1712
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:42,239
general consumer is going to follow

1713
01:09:39,798 --> 01:09:44,679
numbers to an extent and it's really

1714
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:47,039
like the hardcore Community like that

1715
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:49,399
yourself and I exist in that you know

1716
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:52,039
have the luxury of sort of being like

1717
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:54,879
well you know THC percentages aren't

1718
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:57,238
everything yeah I mean I agree with that

1719
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,760
I wholeheartedly I agree like it's when

1720
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:03,039
I when I go into a dispensary not that I

1721
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,840
do it often and you know but if if I go

1722
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:07,960
into I'm not worried I'm not looking at

1723
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:12,319
THC content percentages like I want

1724
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:14,279
flavor I want you know I want to

1725
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:16,799
experience something other than what I

1726
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:20,359
have at my house

1727
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:24,880
so I don't base what I what I buy or or

1728
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:29,479
what I grow on THC content but I do also

1729
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:32,920
as a as a seed maker realize that people

1730
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:36,279
do get seeds and they want High testing

1731
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:37,760
THC content genetics so it's really like

1732
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:39,960
this place in the market and in the

1733
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,159
industry right now where it's it's like

1734
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,840
you're damned if you do and you're

1735
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:45,399
damned if you don't you know um you you

1736
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,840
have to produce things that are going to

1737
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:49,198
have high test scores because at the end

1738
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,840
of the day you still have to give the

1739
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:53,839
people what they're looking for but

1740
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,239
you're also fighting like the ignorant

1741
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,360
of saying

1742
01:10:55,238 --> 01:11:00,959
like you know THC doesn't matter the

1743
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:04,319
content doesn't matter this lab test

1744
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,520
doesn't matter and it it's a weird point

1745
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:10,198
right now that we're at where I think

1746
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:12,760
that the dynamic will shift and people

1747
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:15,000
will start to just appreciate flowers

1748
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,880
again because they can just go get wax

1749
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,800
or go get oil if they want to get

1750
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,520
wrecked

1751
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:25,159
um but I think that that whole thing is

1752
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,560
going to kind of change soon and I'm

1753
01:11:25,158 --> 01:11:28,479
kind of seeing it where people are kind

1754
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:32,320
of like more interested in turine

1755
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:34,678
profiles and you know basically those

1756
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:37,319
kind of lab tests where it's like what

1757
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:39,960
kind of active flavors are you going to

1758
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:43,439
get out of the flowers as opposed to

1759
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,520
what's the THC content um but is it a

1760
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:46,359
breed or it really puts you in a really

1761
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,760
hard place where it's like you just kind

1762
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:50,439
of want to you know mess around with

1763
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,360
with things and make something unique

1764
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:54,279
but it's like you're kind of also like

1765
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:57,839
forced to kind of like C out to this

1766
01:11:54,279 --> 01:12:00,319
whole we need High testers thing so it's

1767
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:03,079
definitely a definitely an issue in my

1768
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:05,279
opinion like I don't know it's a weird

1769
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:08,800
place to be in right

1770
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:11,158
now yeah certainly certainly I mean you

1771
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,520
know another another point that you you

1772
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:15,839
touched on is that you know the roadkill

1773
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,239
skunk likely wasn't as potent as some of

1774
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,279
the more modern stuff and there's

1775
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:19,959
there's like an element of being

1776
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:21,599
reminiscent and I guess you know

1777
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,279
recently there's been a Resurgence of

1778
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,639
older genetics especially in the context

1779
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:28,279
of people looking within them to sort of

1780
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:30,639
make new hybrids going forward and you

1781
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:33,000
know you can sort of look at like Tom

1782
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:35,239
Hills sort of you know been um toying

1783
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,479
with his Hayes and we've seen Todd

1784
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:41,638
McCormick and Caleb and Matt Riot do

1785
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,718
their nl5 re-releases respectively have

1786
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:45,239
you ever had any curiosity to look in

1787
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:47,800
some of this older stuff and do you

1788
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:49,559
think it might be like a viable path

1789
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,119
forward to blend some of that old with

1790
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:55,039
some of that new absolutely I mean in my

1791
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,960
opinion a lot of these current genetics

1792
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:00,158
used a lot of that Old Dutch you know

1793
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:03,198
cense C seed bank you know some of some

1794
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:04,920
of those lines um and I think it would

1795
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:06,359
be foolish not to revisit some of the

1796
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,760
older stuff you know especially the

1797
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:10,960
northern lights or or this you know the

1798
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,000
some of the skunk lines and I mean I

1799
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,439
would love to to do a bunch of Sensei

1800
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:20,079
star work I used to love Sensei star um

1801
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:23,559
it was just like this funky you know

1802
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:25,479
stank gooey flower that just like I I

1803
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,639
was lucky to get my hands on and you

1804
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:29,238
know was getting grown locally and it

1805
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:32,079
just every time I got it it was just

1806
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:33,638
amazing you know so I I personally love

1807
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:34,760
to work with something like that or like

1808
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:37,159
the old

1809
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,800
AK-47 you know some of the guys I've

1810
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:42,759
seen you know over the past like decade

1811
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:45,800
or so they they did a AK-47 a cherry

1812
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:48,840
feno it still wasn't what I remember it

1813
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,400
being but it it was pretty good

1814
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,760
but yeah I think that's great I think

1815
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:54,679
you should always try to bring back some

1816
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,039
of the old stuff and kind of like pay

1817
01:13:54,679 --> 01:14:00,000
homage to it and and give it the respect

1818
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:02,119
it deserves it's you know part of the

1819
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,840
stepping stone to where we are now is is

1820
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:07,039
due to you know some of those genetics

1821
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:09,279
so yeah I'm I'm pumped to see what some

1822
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:11,960
of these guys do with some of the older

1823
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,439
stuff yeah likewise likewise and you

1824
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,119
sort of touched on it with that answer

1825
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:16,960
there but I guess I'll throw throw it

1826
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:19,399
open to any other ones you know are

1827
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,279
there any strains besides say the Sensei

1828
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:25,679
star that have left a lasting memory for

1829
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:29,319
you but sadly no longer have access

1830
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:32,719
to yeah so like I have I have the

1831
01:14:29,319 --> 01:14:36,279
Indiana bubble gum it's good but the

1832
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:39,760
bubble gum in the late 90s the early

1833
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:41,519
2000s was amazing it was completely

1834
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,719
different than the Indiana bubble gum

1835
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,639
and if I could get my hands on that one

1836
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:47,039
I I would love to work with that the

1837
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:50,679
bubble gum was

1838
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:52,719
just it had like this like really

1839
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:55,158
playful kind of like uplifting kind of

1840
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,760
buzz but it wasn't like anxiety driven

1841
01:14:55,158 --> 01:15:00,198
it was just kind of like euphoric you

1842
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:02,679
know um I loved it um the cotton candy

1843
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:05,799
back in the late 9s early 2000 that was

1844
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:08,079
a great one great flavor great

1845
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:10,360
High there's a small handful of ones

1846
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:12,519
that I would I would personally put on

1847
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:14,639
my list there to uh to do a couple

1848
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:17,800
projects with for

1849
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:19,880
sure yeah awesome awesome take me back

1850
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,320
to earlier we were discussing how you

1851
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,679
were getting into cannabis you were

1852
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:25,079
growing you were getting your hands on

1853
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:27,319
these cool genetics at what point did

1854
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:30,920
you officially decide to start skunk

1855
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:32,198
cast genetics so the concept the idea

1856
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,079
the name skunk house was kind of

1857
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:37,799
something I threw around in the Forum

1858
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:40,559
days in like you know 07 and 08 it was

1859
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,679
kind of like my tag my sign off line it

1860
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,679
was like skunk house you know came up

1861
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:47,359
with skunk Master Flex is as a screen

1862
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:49,480
name um you know it was just kind of

1863
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,479
like my little my little house my little

1864
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:54,399
you know grow I used to call this this

1865
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:56,678
skunk dungeon skunk house so skunk house

1866
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:59,158
genetics was kind of just

1867
01:15:56,679 --> 01:16:01,880
like kind of like organic it kind of

1868
01:15:59,158 --> 01:16:02,920
just like happened on its own um it

1869
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:08,400
wasn't

1870
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:10,639
until I had Matt respects on the

1871
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:12,599
forums and he was going through some

1872
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:15,880
stuff um

1873
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:18,239
financially uh his wife had some health

1874
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,600
issues and he was he was in a tough spot

1875
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:23,319
and we kind of went back and forth on it

1876
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:26,000
and he was like Hey you know let's let's

1877
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:27,960
let's drop this seed let's create some

1878
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,560
you know Revenue it really really you

1879
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:32,158
know it would be a big deal to me it

1880
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:35,960
would really help me out we kind of

1881
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:37,960
launched skunk house and I was you know

1882
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,960
just it was a bunch of projects that I

1883
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,679
had done just breeding and I'm you know

1884
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,198
with the intent of just you know being

1885
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:46,440
basically personal work of my own and

1886
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:48,960
not really being like you know a seed

1887
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:51,559
breeder and dropping genetics for public

1888
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,279
but um that was

1889
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:57,199
basically how I launch launched stunk

1890
01:16:54,279 --> 01:17:00,399
house was just based

1891
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:02,839
on his situation and I'm like well you

1892
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:06,158
know I'll start skunk house and he had

1893
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:08,000
California seed bank so um we did all

1894
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:11,839
the vending through California seed bank

1895
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:14,439
and uh that was Rock and Roll history

1896
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,960
there yeah that's that's awesome to hear

1897
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:20,079
and what were some of the first releases

1898
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,960
and and were they the first ones to get

1899
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,439
some traction with the public or did it

1900
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,719
take a little bit of time before the

1901
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,000
general public started to realize the

1902
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:30,840
quality of the

1903
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:35,158
work so the first releases were like um

1904
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:39,400
20 2017 I did my first drop um it was a

1905
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:44,638
bunch of Larry uh OG

1906
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:46,960
F7 uh work bunch of crosses but the year

1907
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:48,679
previous to that I went to the High

1908
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,279
Times cup here in Michigan and was just

1909
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:52,560
kind of like giving out packs of seeds

1910
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:54,519
you know just kind of like spreading

1911
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,440
them out like hey you know hunt these

1912
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,960
have a good time with them and and bunch

1913
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:59,678
of my buddies hunted them a bunch of

1914
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,239
random people that years down the road

1915
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,840
you know when I had a booth and was

1916
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:05,959
bending seed came up and they said hey

1917
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,719
man you know you gave me packs like just

1918
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,520
TOS me packs back like you know two

1919
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:11,000
years ago and they were just epic and

1920
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,679
you know just want to support the brand

1921
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,639
now and

1922
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:19,880
um the original releases were the f8

1923
01:18:16,639 --> 01:18:23,679
stuff and I think it was like I did like

1924
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:26,400
cam 4 cam 9991 TK

1925
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:29,520
um a couple different OG kushes I think

1926
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:32,920
I did like the original Bubba the 98

1927
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,880
Bubba um there's a handful of other

1928
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:37,440
crosses that I made but that was that

1929
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:42,800
was our first my first seed drop that I

1930
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:45,000
ever did was was the OG stuff um which

1931
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,039
is was just amazing some of the stuff

1932
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,880
that came out of there was incredible um

1933
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:53,039
people got their hands on that uh they

1934
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,159
just wanted more so I further worked the

1935
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:59,079
Larry line f8 I was working with the f8

1936
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:00,920
mail um that was when the GMO got

1937
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:04,319
brought in

1938
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:08,440
um with Han Solo Berger that was the

1939
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:13,000
first GMO cross that I did for public

1940
01:19:08,439 --> 01:19:17,198
drop um also the um pollen donor to make

1941
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,840
the Donny Burger to create the the VX so

1942
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:23,599
it was that was a pretty legendary

1943
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:26,119
drop yeah hugely hugely and I've got a

1944
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,440
bunch of questions about the the Donny

1945
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:30,559
burer the Han solid burger and all that

1946
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:34,479
the first one I'd love to swing by you

1947
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,320
is one we actually got from a listener

1948
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:40,000
um which was what sort of stimulated you

1949
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:43,198
initially to begin the burger

1950
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,800
Lawns um I wanted to work with the GMO

1951
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:50,599
because it had such a like impact on my

1952
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:53,079
life that it just it was something that

1953
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,039
I needed to do a cross with and then

1954
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:57,719
once I did do a cross with it I realized

1955
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:59,760
the potential that it could use down the

1956
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:04,198
road genetically and doing hybrids with

1957
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:07,800
it and um like I said isolating certain

1958
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:09,359
phenotypes that just flowered shorter

1959
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,960
and

1960
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,198
just expressed things that were kind of

1961
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:15,480
unique it just it was like a gene pool

1962
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:17,079
that you just kind of like rolled the

1963
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:18,439
dice with and you're like you know let's

1964
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,760
let's kind of see what comes out of this

1965
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:22,000
let's see what kind of unique things we

1966
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:24,239
can do and what we can accomplish you

1967
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,238
know when I was making the seed I didn't

1968
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:29,279
really

1969
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:31,799
realize how it passed um you know hash

1970
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:33,399
potential to other genetics ones that

1971
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,760
maybe necessarily didn't really hash

1972
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:36,238
super well and how it kind of like

1973
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:39,440
lended a hand to kind of give them a

1974
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,718
little boost and um once once I did

1975
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:42,319
realize this it was kind of like a

1976
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,239
no-brainer to be like you know we're

1977
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:46,880
going to do we're going to do a GMO line

1978
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:49,238
and we're just going to do like you know

1979
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,199
kind of like back cross it a few times

1980
01:20:49,238 --> 01:20:54,759
and then kind of work that

1981
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:56,238
and kind of just see where it goes and

1982
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,600
just you know it opened up a whole new

1983
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:02,039
door to things that were were amazing

1984
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,679
that just kind of like went their own

1985
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:06,039
directions you

1986
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,520
know yeah no that's brilliant because it

1987
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:09,880
Segways exactly into what I was going to

1988
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,280
ask you next which is as you progress

1989
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:15,279
further into the GMO back crosses with

1990
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:16,960
the burger lines was your intended

1991
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,960
process to create something that's

1992
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,319
essentially the GMO in seed form or were

1993
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,079
you looking to do something that was

1994
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:24,119
sort of standing on its own two legs and

1995
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:28,000
maybe representing both sides of the

1996
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:30,039
lineage a little more so like when I do

1997
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,238
the straight GMO crosses when I do the

1998
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:35,600
bx2 or the bx3 or the BX 4S that I

1999
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:39,079
finished a couple months back or you

2000
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:41,360
know do a bx5 like my intent with that

2001
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:43,800
on its own is to definitely lock in the

2002
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:45,920
GMO um but like kind of alter a little

2003
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,880
bit you know to kind of like isolate

2004
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,880
certain traits certain things that I

2005
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,319
find less desirable like you know like

2006
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,079
I've said a few times now like you know

2007
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:55,158
the flowering time and stuff like that

2008
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:57,800
but that's definitely to keep the the

2009
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:59,238
majority of the GMO in there um when I

2010
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,440
do the

2011
01:21:59,238 --> 01:22:05,759
outcrosses my main goal with that um

2012
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:07,439
what I Envision anyways is just using

2013
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,840
the parts of it that I like and trying

2014
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:13,960
to eliminate the parts that I don't like

2015
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:17,440
and kind of let whatever um female I'm

2016
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:20,760
using in the cross kind of like

2017
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:23,839
influence it more than the actual poen

2018
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:25,480
from uh the bx2 the bx3 or any of the

2019
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,000
burger stuff you know I just I want to

2020
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:27,678
bring in a little bit of funkiness from

2021
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,238
that

2022
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:32,239
GMO um but I want to like you know bring

2023
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,678
in the stuff that that you know people

2024
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,000
are really looking for you know they

2025
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:39,119
want they want hashers they want yields

2026
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,800
they want you know stack they want you

2027
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:44,599
know that smell but like not dominated

2028
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:47,760
they want

2029
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:50,199
like something else you know it's like

2030
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,719
the gmo's just like a incredible tool to

2031
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:55,919
kind of like loan to other things to

2032
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:57,520
kind of like enhance them you know it's

2033
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,440
like the secret it's like the secret

2034
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,199
ingredient that like you know your

2035
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:04,319
Grandma leaves out of the cooking recipe

2036
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:04,319
that she doesn't tell you

2037
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:10,279
about that's cool I mean you you sort of

2038
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,199
touched on it but I did want to formally

2039
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:14,158
get an answer to you know what would be

2040
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:15,960
your Sal pitch for someone who's sort of

2041
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:18,158
looking at the double burger the triple

2042
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,319
Burger maybe even the Han Solo burger if

2043
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:21,759
they get their hands on some of the

2044
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:23,279
seeds you know how would you describe

2045
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,159
this to them into terms of what they

2046
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,479
should expect if they run a pack of

2047
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:28,960
these

2048
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:30,079
seeds um expect something that is

2049
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,560
completely different than the rest of

2050
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:35,319
the stuff you have in your garden it's

2051
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,760
it's going to be foul it's going to have

2052
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:39,238
you know kind of like that sank you know

2053
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,239
that that something different you know

2054
01:23:39,238 --> 01:23:45,279
what I mean it's it's not a it's not a

2055
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:47,319
candy it's not a dessert kind of thing

2056
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,880
it's it's like its own class which you

2057
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:50,920
know I which is what I believe is kind

2058
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,199
of like what makes it stand out you know

2059
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,880
it kind of created a different category

2060
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:57,719
I mean it it existed a little bit you

2061
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:01,520
know obviously the chmd was around and

2062
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:03,039
the KD's got that kind of funk to it but

2063
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,760
there wasn't like a whole category of

2064
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:08,399
those kind of genetics where it's like

2065
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,320
disgusting foul you know and now you

2066
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:13,039
have that getting crossed with something

2067
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:15,679
that smells awesome that's you know

2068
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:17,119
fruity and and now you got funky fruity

2069
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:20,480
and you know

2070
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:23,000
it's I guess my sales pitch would be you

2071
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:24,599
know it's just different

2072
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,399
it's a it's a breath of fresh air to

2073
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,320
have something that's not the same thing

2074
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:32,559
regurgitated over and over and over

2075
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:35,719
again yeah certainly certainly and you

2076
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,320
know you you sort of touch on this idea

2077
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:38,960
that you mention in I don't know if I'd

2078
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:40,559
call it your slogan but I remembered

2079
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,319
seeing it on your website and it just

2080
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,719
says that you know you got to focus on

2081
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,279
high yields and unique turps and you

2082
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,840
know by virtue of what you've just said

2083
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:51,000
that stands true I guess the follow-up

2084
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,800
question is to what degree do you feel

2085
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,920
like these are important factors in the

2086
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,920
current market because to be honest

2087
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,800
we've never really heard people talk

2088
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:01,158
about high yield being like a necessity

2089
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:04,119
or like something that they're looking

2090
01:25:01,158 --> 01:25:06,559
to actively breed But as time goes by I

2091
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:09,198
think we are seeing an emergence of this

2092
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,880
becoming like a more accepted um

2093
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:13,118
attribute that plants need to have in

2094
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,760
the modern climate you know where do you

2095
01:25:13,118 --> 01:25:17,079
sit on that do you think like you know

2096
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,520
unique turps obviously but High yielding

2097
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:20,399
do you think that this is something that

2098
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:23,080
needs to be factored in by more people

2099
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:25,399
across the board to make strains more

2100
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:28,039
viable so I think I think in places

2101
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:30,839
where you're seeing uh the price of

2102
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:34,639
cannabis you know Bing them out I I

2103
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,639
think that the yield does matter um

2104
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:40,560
obviously not everything has to be drone

2105
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:42,920
for for personal smoke and and you know

2106
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,840
um not everything that's incredible

2107
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:48,480
yielding is going to have devastating

2108
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:53,199
Highs but you need to offset something

2109
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:56,799
genetically to make up for um you know

2110
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:58,960
expenses so yield is important it's not

2111
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,000
the most important but it's definitely

2112
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:05,039
in the top three if you're in the legal

2113
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,359
Market or even you know non-legal Market

2114
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:13,279
it's just where cannabis here in in the

2115
01:26:08,359 --> 01:26:14,960
States has gone is just it's gone down

2116
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:18,118
like the pricing and and the

2117
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:21,359
availability is high so I think that

2118
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:23,118
yield is becoming more relevant I think

2119
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:24,279
people used to say that the yield

2120
01:26:23,118 --> 01:26:26,960
doesn't

2121
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:29,439
matter but I think that Dynamic is going

2122
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,439
to shift it already has shifted here

2123
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:33,279
where I'm at I know that you know

2124
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:34,839
commercially there's just some things

2125
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:36,719
that aren't viable to grow because of

2126
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:39,400
yield like you couldn't do rooms of

2127
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,319
veral and some of this bubba and stuff

2128
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:43,599
and and if you did your your price tag

2129
01:26:41,319 --> 01:26:46,000
would have to justify the fact that it

2130
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,760
yields or it Veges or it takes you know

2131
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,960
more time and and cost more to cultivate

2132
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,119
and um I think a lot of these companies

2133
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,760
are offsetting with things that yield so

2134
01:26:54,118 --> 01:26:58,479
um like I said that's taking some of

2135
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,840
this burger genetic and Crossing it to

2136
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:03,198
things that don't yield and kind of

2137
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:06,679
utilizing the the GMO and you know what

2138
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:08,198
it does in a commercial setting minus

2139
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:11,079
the time

2140
01:27:08,198 --> 01:27:13,960
is I mean it's it's a great it's a great

2141
01:27:11,079 --> 01:27:16,719
method for for

2142
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,239
Success yeah certainly certainly and I

2143
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:20,158
want to touch a little bit on the

2144
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:22,238
Michigan scene because it's not one

2145
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:24,039
we've spoken about extensively in the

2146
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:26,359
past and yeah I do remember reading an

2147
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:28,279
article the other day and I I might be

2148
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:29,759
getting this wrong but I it basically

2149
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:32,559
said something to the effect that like

2150
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:35,039
Michigan is one of if not the the

2151
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:37,280
largest flower producing states in the

2152
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,519
USA right now which again I might have

2153
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:41,000
misremembered that quote but it

2154
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,400
regardless of whether it was the most or

2155
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,118
like still second to California or

2156
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:46,839
whatever the point remains like it's

2157
01:27:44,118 --> 01:27:48,559
it's a very quickly rising star and it's

2158
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,000
it's I shouldn't say rising star it's

2159
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,679
been doing its thing for a long time

2160
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,600
right but how would you describe the

2161
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:56,239
state of Michigan at the moment and do

2162
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,960
you feel like it is having a big Surge

2163
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:58,839
and putting it on par with somewhere

2164
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,840
like

2165
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:04,480
California oh yeah The Surge is enormous

2166
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:07,000
here I mean I've been to uh countless

2167
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,479
facilities um done a bunch of

2168
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,800
walkthroughs there's some I mean

2169
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:13,839
Michigan has a very impressive

2170
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:17,039
cultivation um Department in general

2171
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:19,960
like our our cultivating here our hash

2172
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:23,560
making here I mean it just it escalated

2173
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:26,480
so quick um there's so many companies

2174
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:29,840
that are involved now and the market is

2175
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:34,039
just so saturated that you really have

2176
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:36,520
to be like at the top of your game um I

2177
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:41,439
know I just entered the legal Market um

2178
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:43,199
shout out to PR gr my team over there um

2179
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:46,678
they guys do amazing job I mean you eat

2180
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:51,359
up the floor it's so clean in the place

2181
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:52,639
um just on scale like it's just you

2182
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,479
really just got to be at the top of your

2183
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:58,118
game and and those guys over there are

2184
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:59,198
just incredible and I mean it's just I

2185
01:28:58,118 --> 01:29:00,880
don't I don't know how to describe it

2186
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:02,519
besides like maybe like the boom in

2187
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,560
California Market you know what I mean

2188
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,960
it's just it really makes people rise of

2189
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:11,320
the occasion really hone in their

2190
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:13,158
craft yeah nice okay and I mean you sort

2191
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:15,719
of just touched on it but do you think

2192
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:17,839
pairing with like a big facility is one

2193
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:19,198
of the only viable ways to go forward as

2194
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,039
a breeder or do you think you could do

2195
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:25,079
your thing as a small um home Scout

2196
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:27,118
hobby Enthusiast sort of operation or do

2197
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:29,399
you really need that size and scale to

2198
01:29:27,118 --> 01:29:31,158
be making an impact um I think you could

2199
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:35,559
do it on your own I think quality just

2200
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:37,799
has to be has to be there um I mean I'm

2201
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:40,159
still you know a caregiver of sorts like

2202
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,920
on my own M personal grow and stuff like

2203
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:44,559
that and and I always will have some

2204
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:46,719
kind of a grow going um so I mean

2205
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:49,239
there's always room for that but it's

2206
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:52,399
definitely becoming smaller and the

2207
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:53,638
opportunity is is less um these big

2208
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,599
facilities are

2209
01:29:53,639 --> 01:30:00,760
definitely crushing the caregiver Market

2210
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:02,320
here but I think that high quality

2211
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:06,039
flower is always going to be in demand

2212
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:08,519
and if you can you know find a way to

2213
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:11,118
cultivate like like my guys over there

2214
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:13,520
have um and scale up to that level and

2215
01:30:11,118 --> 01:30:16,719
still produce that kind of quality I

2216
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:19,840
think uh I think it's a win-win for

2217
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:22,679
everybody yeah hugely hugely and what do

2218
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:24,480
you think is the future for the m and

2219
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:26,000
pop growers in Michigan do you think

2220
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:27,079
that you know we're going to see a

2221
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,118
similar thing to what happened in

2222
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:30,840
California where over time the smaller

2223
01:30:29,118 --> 01:30:33,000
producers may get forced out of the

2224
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:35,480
market due to economies of scale and

2225
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,079
other sort of factors like that

2226
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:39,718
absolutely I mean you're you're already

2227
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:41,800
seeing that now you're seeing you know

2228
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:44,359
even even commercial grows I mean that

2229
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:48,840
just aren't hitting their numbers and

2230
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:50,839
just doing work properly and and just

2231
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:52,440
really you know honing in their

2232
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,639
cultivation departments they're they're

2233
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:56,359
getting wiped out I mean it's it's sad

2234
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,359
to see but

2235
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:59,679
it's it's the same thing that kind of

2236
01:30:58,359 --> 01:31:01,559
happened in California or any of these

2237
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:03,039
other states you know it's just you you

2238
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,920
really got to step your game up and

2239
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:09,039
really just take advantage of a full

2240
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:11,039
work day and and put in the work put in

2241
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:14,319
the time and take pride in what you're

2242
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:16,198
trying to produce and um I mean to

2243
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:17,960
answer your question I mean it's yeah

2244
01:31:16,198 --> 01:31:19,759
it's these these small places are going

2245
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:22,520
down and it's not necessarily because

2246
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:25,199
they're small but just because you know

2247
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:28,440
other people are rising more to the

2248
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:31,238
occasion yeah okay and and so what would

2249
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:32,359
be yours glass ball prediction for 10

2250
01:31:31,238 --> 01:31:33,799
years time where do you think the

2251
01:31:32,359 --> 01:31:36,319
industry will be do you think we're all

2252
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:38,320
going to be puffing on Vape sticks and

2253
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:41,479
no one cares for flour anymore cuz I

2254
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:43,840
have to admit you know I um although I

2255
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:45,839
live in Australia my brother-in-law he

2256
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,400
he lives in America and he's like 22

2257
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,119
right so he's young and he's like my

2258
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:53,920
pulse on the general sort of um you know

2259
01:31:51,118 --> 01:31:56,000
casual smokers and he he calls me a

2260
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:58,319
dinosaur for smoking flour he's like bro

2261
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,880
get a babe stick like you know where do

2262
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:01,759
where do you think we'll be in 10 years

2263
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,480
time if that is sort of the sentiment we

2264
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,679
see from some of the younger

2265
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:08,319
Generations yeah I get that I mean I

2266
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:09,800
definitely I get that I understand where

2267
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:12,599
where you know you're coming from on

2268
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:16,000
that sentiment like you're

2269
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:19,280
seeing flower kind of becoming less

2270
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,198
relevant but you know here like 10 years

2271
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:24,118
ago people were like flower was dead to

2272
01:32:22,198 --> 01:32:27,559
them and everybody was just dabbing they

2273
01:32:24,118 --> 01:32:30,000
were just hitting oil you know and now

2274
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:32,440
it's like the oil Market's like probably

2275
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,760
10% of the sales or something you know

2276
01:32:32,439 --> 01:32:37,879
so I think things are you know kind of

2277
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,079
not necessarily dying or transitioning

2278
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,480
but there's like little phases and then

2279
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:44,559
people kind of like get out of that and

2280
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,439
they're just like well I you know hit

2281
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,239
flower the other day and it's just like

2282
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:49,879
wow I missed it like I don't know why I

2283
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:53,319
was just smoking so much oil and wasn't

2284
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:54,960
really rolling anything up so I think

2285
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:57,559
that you'll go through these little tiny

2286
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,800
phases where you know things will lose

2287
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:01,480
relevance and then they'll gain

2288
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,279
relevance again so I mean it would for

2289
01:33:01,479 --> 01:33:05,479
me it would be devastating because I am

2290
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:07,439
a flower smoker like through and through

2291
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:10,238
and I can't really

2292
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:13,158
appreciate oil as much as you know some

2293
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:15,279
of these other guys um these Vape things

2294
01:33:13,158 --> 01:33:20,118
are super convenient like I'm not going

2295
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:22,639
to lie I carry a rosin disposable pen in

2296
01:33:20,118 --> 01:33:26,639
my pocket most of the day and it's just

2297
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:29,400
you know I can't just spark up joint

2298
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:30,639
anywhere I go and you know sometimes I

2299
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:32,158
don't want a smoke ho joint and I just

2300
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,480
wanted a couple hits

2301
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:35,599
and whole Vape game has just made it

2302
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:37,279
very

2303
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:41,679
convenient

2304
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:44,198
and I mean I I I love Vapes but it's

2305
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:46,679
never going to be flower to me it's

2306
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:50,118
always just

2307
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:53,039
like an ease to get through until I can

2308
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:55,639
smoke some flour

2309
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,840
I like that I can relate for sure and

2310
01:33:55,639 --> 01:33:59,560
you know you you talked of how you know

2311
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,960
these things sort of e and flow like

2312
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:03,760
when you were mentioning like you know

2313
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,279
the BHO and concentrates in that same

2314
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:09,320
vein you know on the show we often talk

2315
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:10,920
about the flavor of the month being very

2316
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:13,238
cyclical you know it's like fashion you

2317
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:15,560
know these things go in circles and at

2318
01:34:13,238 --> 01:34:18,839
the moment the consensus seems to be

2319
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:20,560
that the dominant flavor in the market

2320
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:22,760
you know for lack of a better term is

2321
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,639
the purple candy gas you know if you

2322
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:27,159
look at people like compound and cookies

2323
01:34:25,639 --> 01:34:29,079
and the guys who are sort of dominating

2324
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:30,439
the market that's the general Vibe I

2325
01:34:29,079 --> 01:34:31,920
want to know what's your flavor

2326
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:33,719
prediction for the future what do you

2327
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:36,840
think Jud to come back

2328
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:39,000
around oh is coming back gas is gas is

2329
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:40,960
making its way back around nothing would

2330
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,560
make me more

2331
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,800
happy uh yeah but yeah I get I get what

2332
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:48,039
you're saying there's definitely like

2333
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:52,719
this huge wave of Lemon Cherry gelato

2334
01:34:48,039 --> 01:34:54,479
and and and that whole kind of vibe um

2335
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:56,319
it's it'll be like you know it'll be

2336
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:59,000
like cookies you know when cookies hit

2337
01:34:56,319 --> 01:35:02,198
here people were like you know what's OG

2338
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,960
it's everything's cookies like OG's dead

2339
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:05,279
and then you know cookies kind of

2340
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,439
started to fizzle out and then you

2341
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:09,319
started getting these different gelato

2342
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:10,759
kind of things that were kind of similar

2343
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:13,920
and people went on these little tiny

2344
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:16,960
phases where you know it was like the

2345
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,359
lemoner gelato and the nonsense and you

2346
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,800
know they all have their place and I've

2347
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:22,439
had some of them and I was impressed by

2348
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,840
some of them and you know

2349
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:25,719
I kind of get tired of them after a

2350
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,159
little while they're not something

2351
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:29,679
that's you know like a cush to me where

2352
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:32,000
I can smoke it day in and day out it's

2353
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,480
not like a desert island strand for me

2354
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,158
but um yeah I've enjoyed some of them

2355
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,479
and I can see their relevance for a

2356
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:40,079
period of time and these guys have

2357
01:35:37,479 --> 01:35:43,399
really good marketing so that doesn't

2358
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:44,760
that doesn't hurt at all um but yeah

2359
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:48,279
it's like flavor of the week for sure

2360
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:50,679
stuff um the Diesels and the chams and

2361
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:52,599
and the kushes are going to make their

2362
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:54,359
way back and they already are I think

2363
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,119
it's just they're not as accessible to

2364
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:59,519
some people as some of this other stuff

2365
01:35:56,118 --> 01:36:03,599
is so it might take a little bit longer

2366
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:06,280
but done properly and you know I guess

2367
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,520
marketed correctly I think that the uh

2368
01:36:06,279 --> 01:36:11,359
the Kush wave will be here

2369
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,199
again yeah beautiful beautiful and you

2370
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,359
know you mentioned cookies and then how

2371
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:17,638
it gave way to gelados and the more

2372
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:20,359
newer waves I'd love to ask you you know

2373
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:22,118
a lot of people talk as though you know

2374
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:23,960
cookies and then progressing to gelato

2375
01:36:22,118 --> 01:36:27,599
and then maybe the more modern extension

2376
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:30,158
is you know like your RS 11s now do you

2377
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,960
feel like this is a genetic dead end

2378
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,920
that sometimes people talk of it as do

2379
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,639
you do you agree with that sentiment and

2380
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,520
would it ever stop you from breeding

2381
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,560
with that stuff or are you not quite of

2382
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,560
the view that you know it's this Doom

2383
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,880
and Gloom genetic dead

2384
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,719
end I mean I think that some of these

2385
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,319
guys are going to hit dead ends where

2386
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:51,840
it's just so many things combined that

2387
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:54,920
it's just not unique and and just has no

2388
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:57,039
value to really contribute to cannabis

2389
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,158
you know what I mean um some of these

2390
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:01,039
other guys um that are doing some of

2391
01:36:59,158 --> 01:37:03,279
this breeding they're really kind of

2392
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:06,079
looking to isolate certain things and be

2393
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:08,719
unique and I think that will make way to

2394
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:11,118
the next phase of where things kind of

2395
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,439
go and they'll be heavy contributors to

2396
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:16,599
helping out

2397
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:18,238
um where we go with all this genetically

2398
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,440
but there's definitely people you know

2399
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:20,759
and a lot of that stuff's like money

2400
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:24,000
grab stuff where it's like I'm going to

2401
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:26,119
use the hot labor and cross it to um

2402
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,118
whatever it is that I got going on and

2403
01:37:26,118 --> 01:37:32,519
kind of you know do it for sales you

2404
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:34,399
know everybody has to do a little bit of

2405
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,639
it but you know some of these guys like

2406
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:37,679
you said you know they're bringing back

2407
01:37:35,639 --> 01:37:39,800
some of this old stuff and I think some

2408
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:41,359
of those genetic lines are definitely

2409
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:45,360
responsible for a lot of the stuff that

2410
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:47,198
we see so you know through isolation of

2411
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,118
of certain traits and other things I

2412
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:50,719
think I think we'll have different waves

2413
01:37:49,118 --> 01:37:52,719
and different directions that we go in

2414
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:55,960
and people have different needs and

2415
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:58,359
wants and they'll breed for those and

2416
01:37:55,960 --> 01:38:01,880
then we'll move on to the next phase

2417
01:37:58,359 --> 01:38:04,359
trying to be as optimistic as

2418
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:06,359
possible yeah definitely definitely it's

2419
01:38:04,359 --> 01:38:07,839
sort of you know I've said this once or

2420
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:10,479
twice on the show but it sort of makes

2421
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,960
me want to like get like someone on the

2422
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:15,279
show who's like hectically down the

2423
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,880
rabbit hole of like the craft beer

2424
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:18,158
industry or something because I'm sure

2425
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,760
there are other industries that have

2426
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:22,079
gone through what we're experiencing

2427
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,639
where like you know bud dominated the

2428
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,559
market and the real heady you know the

2429
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:27,079
equivalent of the haze of craft beer or

2430
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,440
whatever falls off cuz no one wants to

2431
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:31,719
pay for it and and yet we see you know a

2432
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:33,879
Resurgence of The Craft Beer scene now

2433
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:35,840
so I'm sure that in time these things

2434
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:39,079
will stay around and pop back up but I

2435
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:41,039
wonder what the life cycle is yeah I

2436
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:42,319
mean like with the beer industry because

2437
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:44,599
you brought it up I'll use that as an

2438
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:47,118
LGA like you know if you told somebody

2439
01:38:44,599 --> 01:38:49,960
in the 80s that sour beer was going to

2440
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:52,598
be a thing you know they'd be like yeah

2441
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:54,920
for what you know it's no it's not well

2442
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:58,760
there's a whole category of sours now

2443
01:38:54,920 --> 01:39:01,319
you know um so I mean I think as long as

2444
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:03,039
people are kind of like being you know

2445
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:04,639
ingenuitive about how they're doing

2446
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:06,359
their breeding I think that people are

2447
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:08,118
going to stumble upon things that kind

2448
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:11,118
of like open up doorways to different

2449
01:39:08,118 --> 01:39:14,519
paths that kind of really help benefit

2450
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:16,039
you know the industry as a whole and you

2451
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,360
know who knows what those are you know

2452
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:18,639
it could be you know some of these

2453
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:20,839
Northern Lights projects that you're

2454
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:23,560
talking about people working with or you

2455
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:25,119
know some of these other old school ones

2456
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,679
um getting brought and mashed together

2457
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:28,238
some of the newer age genetics and kind

2458
01:39:26,679 --> 01:39:29,960
of opening up doorways that we didn't

2459
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:32,319
know I

2460
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:34,880
think certain things are going to

2461
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:36,238
basically be maxed out or are maxed out

2462
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,800
I don't think weed is going to really

2463
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:41,479
necessarily get much stronger um as far

2464
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,039
as like lab testing goes I think we're

2465
01:39:41,479 --> 01:39:46,238
pretty much maxed out in there I can't

2466
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:48,079
really imagine something breaking 40

2467
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:51,598
plus percent it just

2468
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:53,238
like doesn't seem possible

2469
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:55,440
you know you need so much of it to

2470
01:39:53,238 --> 01:39:58,198
actually be plant matter to hold

2471
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:00,198
triome so I think we're kind of getting

2472
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:03,519
close to a dead end or at a dead end

2473
01:40:00,198 --> 01:40:05,919
with potency unless they figure out some

2474
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:07,560
like chemicals that are in certain

2475
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,000
genetics that they're not able to test

2476
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:13,320
for or not testing for maybe a certain

2477
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:17,399
combination of certain active chemicals

2478
01:40:13,319 --> 01:40:20,840
um basically making you feel more stoned

2479
01:40:17,399 --> 01:40:24,479
as a whole but I think flavors are going

2480
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,639
to be the Turing game is going to be

2481
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:29,399
where things are

2482
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:31,400
going yeah that's a that's a great point

2483
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:34,279
and uh I'd love to ask you cuz you

2484
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:36,679
mentioned it what do you think is like

2485
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:38,559
the the rough ballpark percentage you

2486
01:40:36,679 --> 01:40:40,679
would be comfortable accepting because

2487
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,920
for a long time you know I talked to

2488
01:40:40,679 --> 01:40:45,158
people about I think in the past I've

2489
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,359
said anything above 30% I just don't

2490
01:40:45,158 --> 01:40:48,839
know if I can really believe it what's

2491
01:40:47,359 --> 01:40:53,238
your thoughts on that

2492
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:55,119
one um you know it's like one of those

2493
01:40:53,238 --> 01:40:59,118
you take a you take flowers and you get

2494
01:40:55,118 --> 01:41:00,960
attested at three different labs and you

2495
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:05,158
get slightly different numbers from

2496
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:08,158
every La so I guess until they figure

2497
01:41:05,158 --> 01:41:09,960
out some honest gold standard you know

2498
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:14,319
who's to say what is and what isn't you

2499
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:15,679
know um I have the Han Solo that that we

2500
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:18,319
have here in Michigan that we have

2501
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,840
available um on the legal Market it'll

2502
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:22,198
test at 37

2503
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,920
38%

2504
01:41:22,198 --> 01:41:26,559
and I mean when you smoke it you know

2505
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:29,679
it's strong it's you know are those

2506
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:31,000
numbers accurate I don't know we tested

2507
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:33,239
at a few different labs and they've came

2508
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,479
up like that they've retested it and it

2509
01:41:33,238 --> 01:41:39,319
came up the same um so who's really to

2510
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:40,799
say um that kind of goes back on the

2511
01:41:39,319 --> 01:41:42,840
whole what we were talking about earlier

2512
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,400
like do numbers really matter you know

2513
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:48,520
and shouldn't it be more on the end user

2514
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:50,638
and and the effect that they get that's

2515
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:53,599
that's what I think I think that THC

2516
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:54,920
kind content is not irrelevant but it

2517
01:41:53,599 --> 01:41:56,599
shouldn't be the thing that you're

2518
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:57,639
focused on as a consumer when you walk

2519
01:41:56,599 --> 01:42:00,400
into a

2520
01:41:57,639 --> 01:42:01,520
shop yeah certainly well look you know

2521
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:03,598
you touched on the idea of

2522
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,639
standardization and I think in order to

2523
01:42:03,599 --> 01:42:07,679
get that there would probably likely

2524
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:10,079
need to be Federal legalization so I'd

2525
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,840
love to ask you what's your thoughts on

2526
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:13,639
the idea of impending Federal

2527
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,440
legalization in the States and how do

2528
01:42:13,639 --> 01:42:17,800
you think it might change the landscape

2529
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:18,960
of the industry well I think it's going

2530
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,079
to happen eventually because the

2531
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,800
government wants their money

2532
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:25,599
um and that's as simple as that is I

2533
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,000
mean that's the majority of the States

2534
01:42:25,599 --> 01:42:29,840
you know besides people going in there

2535
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,238
and actually voting but it's tax money

2536
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,079
you know it's it's Revenue it's

2537
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:36,158
standardizing it across on a federal

2538
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:39,719
level is eventually one day going to

2539
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:42,719
happen because it would it would

2540
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:46,960
eliminate you know the black market

2541
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:49,319
basically for the most part um it's

2542
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,599
definitely the impact that they've had

2543
01:42:49,319 --> 01:42:54,079
through legalization has has destroyed

2544
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:56,920
the black market um to a certain point

2545
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,559
already so I don't see why they would

2546
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,199
stop it's only going to get them more

2547
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,080
money in their their their hands by

2548
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:06,879
making it federally legal um I think

2549
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:09,840
it'll be cool to see how it unfolds with

2550
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:12,039
these companies doing multi-state now

2551
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,279
and continuing to spread across where

2552
01:43:12,039 --> 01:43:16,000
you're going to get companies that are

2553
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:18,759
like the marro of weed where it's like

2554
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:22,840
you know just absolutely trash there's

2555
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:26,560
no craft at all to it it's just packs of

2556
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,920
joints for dirt and some people will be

2557
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,719
okay with that some people don't care

2558
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,158
you know there's people go into a store

2559
01:43:29,719 --> 01:43:34,319
and buy Bush beer all the time and it's

2560
01:43:31,158 --> 01:43:36,519
cheap as hell um and some people you

2561
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:38,679
know buy a four pack that cost as much

2562
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:40,960
as a whole case of beer and that

2563
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:43,239
Market's always going to be there so

2564
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:45,719
whether it's through full legalization

2565
01:43:43,238 --> 01:43:48,638
on a federal level or things stay how

2566
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:50,480
they are and probably probably will for

2567
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,679
another what maybe two or three years

2568
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:54,238
but

2569
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:55,118
I think it'll be a hard push through

2570
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:57,198
that

2571
01:43:55,118 --> 01:43:59,759
and I think we're going to see some big

2572
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:02,079
changes and it's going to be harder to

2573
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,880
play ball here for

2574
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:07,800
sure yeah sure and I mean what might be

2575
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:10,118
your advice for anyone who's you know

2576
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,719
trying to establish themselves in an

2577
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:13,519
industry where it feels like it's

2578
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:15,920
becoming increasingly difficult because

2579
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:18,080
I have heard this sentiment from a few

2580
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,039
people who are you know just sort of

2581
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:22,279
starting to get really passionate about

2582
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:24,800
cannabis and the gist of what they

2583
01:44:22,279 --> 01:44:28,079
express is that like it's never felt

2584
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:31,760
more difficult than ever to say try to

2585
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:33,719
be a breeder or to be a grower who's not

2586
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,520
just you know providing myself with some

2587
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:37,719
flowers but trying to actually get into

2588
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:40,480
the industry any advice you might be

2589
01:44:37,719 --> 01:44:42,118
able to give people yeah I mean it's

2590
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:44,039
it's the same sent that I've said you

2591
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:47,479
know since

2592
01:44:44,039 --> 01:44:50,719
299 98 when I first started smoking like

2593
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:53,319
it's all going to be genetic you know um

2594
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:55,679
to cultivate that genetic properly and

2595
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:59,759
and on a craft level is obviously a huge

2596
01:44:55,679 --> 01:45:02,760
ticket to that but um you know having

2597
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:05,000
something unique if if every store you

2598
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,639
walked into to buy any product if all

2599
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,399
the products were the same then why are

2600
01:45:07,639 --> 01:45:12,279
you buying one company over another

2601
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:14,158
company you know if if quality is the

2602
01:45:12,279 --> 01:45:17,000
same and and the product's the same then

2603
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:21,559
what is it matter you know so my thing

2604
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:25,399
that I would say to people to not

2605
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:27,400
discourage them is that you need to

2606
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:29,238
[ __ ] pop seeds man you need to find

2607
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:31,399
some unique [ __ ] that people don't have

2608
01:45:29,238 --> 01:45:33,279
and kind of separate yourself and and

2609
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:36,279
kind of make your own W and kind of you

2610
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:38,759
know kind of do that whole route

2611
01:45:36,279 --> 01:45:40,198
because it's you know only a race to the

2612
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,679
bottom if you're playing by the same

2613
01:45:40,198 --> 01:45:45,198
rules if you're making up your own

2614
01:45:42,679 --> 01:45:47,599
genetic pool and you're kind of like you

2615
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,879
know got Unique Products then it's

2616
01:45:47,599 --> 01:45:51,679
there's always going to be an audience

2617
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:54,039
for that you know just it's part of the

2618
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:57,880
whole adapting to

2619
01:45:54,039 --> 01:46:00,158
um the whole game you know it's just you

2620
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,679
got to have your own unique Twist on it

2621
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:04,598
and play yeah definitely that's

2622
01:46:02,679 --> 01:46:06,520
certainly a sentiment I can get behind

2623
01:46:04,599 --> 01:46:08,159
I've been trying to sort of push that a

2624
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:10,560
bit myself you know encouraging people

2625
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:12,519
to do their own thing and as opposed to

2626
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:14,440
trying to do your own Kush Min hybrid

2627
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:17,719
I'm sure jbz can probably do a better

2628
01:46:14,439 --> 01:46:19,598
one than you or I so um in that line of

2629
01:46:17,719 --> 01:46:21,480
thought you know what would be your

2630
01:46:19,599 --> 01:46:23,239
advice to someone who wants to start

2631
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:25,519
their own breeding project and

2632
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:28,039
specifically how would you advise them

2633
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,040
in terms of like selecting the genetics

2634
01:46:28,039 --> 01:46:31,479
would you say work with stuff that's

2635
01:46:30,039 --> 01:46:33,399
totally different to what other people

2636
01:46:31,479 --> 01:46:34,678
are using or would you say work with

2637
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:36,559
what you're passionate about and then

2638
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:39,480
try to drive it in a Direction That's

2639
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:42,800
Unique where would you start I mean I

2640
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:44,439
always use the passion route because if

2641
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,880
you don't really stand behind anything

2642
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:49,279
you're doing then the second that it

2643
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:51,319
starts to not make sense like on a

2644
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:53,559
financial level you're GNA want to back

2645
01:46:51,319 --> 01:46:55,198
away and that's breeding is like a long

2646
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:58,920
game if you're doing it right it's I

2647
01:46:55,198 --> 01:47:00,198
mean you can't like Rush the process um

2648
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:03,399
you're going to want to use stuff that

2649
01:47:00,198 --> 01:47:04,719
people like but put your Twist on it you

2650
01:47:03,399 --> 01:47:07,799
know what I mean

2651
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:10,158
it's take take your passion and kind of

2652
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,679
make a fusion of of what other people

2653
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:13,759
you know around you have passion about

2654
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:15,719
when it comes to cannabis and I mean I

2655
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:18,280
do it in my lines you know not I'm not

2656
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:20,679
crazy about you know

2657
01:47:18,279 --> 01:47:23,960
gelato and some of these other things

2658
01:47:20,679 --> 01:47:26,719
that over the years I've used um but to

2659
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:29,520
take something like that and then put my

2660
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:32,239
Twist on it and kind of like put my tag

2661
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:35,360
on it and say like it's like gelato is

2662
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:37,439
okay but this thing that I did to it

2663
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:41,238
makes it better and you want to run

2664
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:44,399
these seats you know so my suggestion to

2665
01:47:41,238 --> 01:47:46,799
people is always use passion it's always

2666
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:49,319
always the thing that's going to be um

2667
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:51,199
the accelerator in in your

2668
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:53,960
career

2669
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:56,158
yeah certainly certainly and uh before

2670
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:57,920
we get to talking about male selection

2671
01:47:56,158 --> 01:48:00,000
which is always a topic people ke to

2672
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:02,239
hear about I want to ask I've heard

2673
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,118
increasing sentiments not just from

2674
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:06,799
breeders but more importantly from

2675
01:48:04,118 --> 01:48:08,839
actual seed banks and seed bank owners

2676
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:11,279
that they feel that there's been a bit

2677
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:13,639
of a change in the market demand and

2678
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:16,039
that the majority of the market is

2679
01:48:13,639 --> 01:48:19,079
primarily only interested in feminized

2680
01:48:16,039 --> 01:48:21,679
seeds these days have you noticed that

2681
01:48:19,079 --> 01:48:23,439
reflection within your own sales and

2682
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:25,279
what's your thoughts on a growing demand

2683
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:26,678
for feminize and less interest in

2684
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:29,599
regular

2685
01:48:26,679 --> 01:48:31,960
seeds I mean femin seeds have definitely

2686
01:48:29,599 --> 01:48:36,039
progressed to be more popular than they

2687
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:37,599
used to be um without a doubt um I think

2688
01:48:36,039 --> 01:48:40,079
that's great I think that there's a

2689
01:48:37,599 --> 01:48:42,960
certain Market a certain percentage of

2690
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:45,479
the seed popping Market that doesn't

2691
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:47,719
have the space to deal with male plants

2692
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:48,879
so they don't care for them they don't

2693
01:48:47,719 --> 01:48:51,920
they don't need to have it in their

2694
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:55,000
stock and I think I I mean I do

2695
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:57,039
understand that completely so that's a

2696
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,198
big part of what makes feminized seeds

2697
01:48:57,039 --> 01:49:00,279
you know

2698
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:02,519
relevant

2699
01:49:00,279 --> 01:49:05,679
um it kind of

2700
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:08,400
eliminates the selection process and

2701
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:10,399
makes it easier to make genetic

2702
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,439
combinations but there is trial and

2703
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:14,719
error involved with reversal of of

2704
01:49:12,439 --> 01:49:17,598
female genetics and sometimes some

2705
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:19,480
plants don't want to so there's a lot of

2706
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:21,159
you know trial and error that goes along

2707
01:49:19,479 --> 01:49:24,919
with that

2708
01:49:21,158 --> 01:49:28,598
so I mean they both have their own

2709
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:30,480
obstacles but traditional breeding is a

2710
01:49:28,599 --> 01:49:32,480
lot more on the

2711
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:33,678
selection now none of these factors

2712
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:35,519
matter if you're running and testing

2713
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,800
your seeds and and seeing what comes of

2714
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,239
them you're just kind of wasting space

2715
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,920
and you're not burning people's time and

2716
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:44,638
their money so

2717
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:46,920
um that's really on the Breeders end but

2718
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,400
I mean I definitely see where feminized

2719
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:52,399
seeds are are kind of the majority of

2720
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:54,000
the market probably more than 50%

2721
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:55,638
they're probably you know maybe 60% on

2722
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,439
the market some people are really

2723
01:49:55,639 --> 01:49:59,480
actively looking for fem seeds and I

2724
01:49:57,439 --> 01:50:02,000
mean some people use like Autos you know

2725
01:49:59,479 --> 01:50:03,718
I haven't really gotten to Autos myself

2726
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,439
but

2727
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:08,800
um there's a place for

2728
01:50:06,439 --> 01:50:11,118
everything well you read my mind cuz I

2729
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,920
was going to ask you you know I've seen

2730
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:16,359
a myriad of GMO autos on the markets

2731
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,760
have you ever tried any Autos in general

2732
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:20,479
or more specifically any of the GMO ones

2733
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:22,800
and what's your thoughts on autos in

2734
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:24,799
general I ran some Autos in the early

2735
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:28,760
2000s when I had really really

2736
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:31,639
restricted space and um wasn't really

2737
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:32,920
super knowledgeable genetically um had a

2738
01:50:31,639 --> 01:50:36,639
buddy that went to Amsterdam brought

2739
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:38,279
back some some autos and can't even

2740
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:44,319
remember what they were at this point so

2741
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:46,399
long ago but um not my thing um I guess

2742
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:48,000
for out outdoor Farmers that you know a

2743
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:51,118
lot of these guys are doing

2744
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:55,198
Autos um

2745
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:57,679
I just don't see them dominating the

2746
01:50:55,198 --> 01:51:00,118
market over traditional or feminized

2747
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:01,480
seeds in general but the couple guys

2748
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:02,880
that are doing the Autos are really

2749
01:51:01,479 --> 01:51:05,198
doing a good job with them I mean

2750
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:08,599
they've i' I've seen the progress they

2751
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:10,359
used to be really bad and uh over the

2752
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:12,520
you know maybe past five years some of

2753
01:51:10,359 --> 01:51:15,158
these guys have really um kind of dialed

2754
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:18,079
it in and actually gotten some not hemp

2755
01:51:15,158 --> 01:51:21,399
looking nonsense to come out of them so

2756
01:51:18,078 --> 01:51:23,039
you know props to them on that some of

2757
01:51:21,399 --> 01:51:24,719
the some of the Autos were just terrible

2758
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:27,399
for

2759
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:29,359
years definitely you know I think low

2760
01:51:27,399 --> 01:51:31,158
rider might have left a bad taste in a

2761
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:33,118
lot of people's mouth low rider that's

2762
01:51:31,158 --> 01:51:36,920
what it was yeah low

2763
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:38,279
rider there you go there you go um so I

2764
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:40,599
guess you know if we just loop back to

2765
01:51:38,279 --> 01:51:42,920
the question before about the feminized

2766
01:51:40,599 --> 01:51:45,639
stuff I do wonder you know for a long

2767
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,679
time people had concerns about breeding

2768
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:50,319
with feminized seeds you know and I

2769
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:52,279
think that empirically this has been

2770
01:51:50,319 --> 01:51:54,439
proven to not be a big issue if you

2771
01:51:52,279 --> 01:51:56,960
think about it in the sense that like

2772
01:51:54,439 --> 01:51:58,719
canado compound a whole bunch of

2773
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,198
breeders out there you know they make F

2774
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:03,000
and then they find stuff out of that and

2775
01:52:00,198 --> 01:52:05,078
they make F and doesn't appear on the

2776
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,520
surface that all of the seeds they make

2777
01:52:05,078 --> 01:52:10,679
are now just hermy riddled but the

2778
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:13,199
question is do you feel like over time

2779
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:15,960
we may run into issues if we are just

2780
01:52:13,198 --> 01:52:18,319
using FS to breed endlessly and we don't

2781
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:20,520
necessarily incorporate regular males

2782
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:22,599
into the genetics

2783
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:24,360
I mean I think so for sure but I'm not

2784
01:52:22,599 --> 01:52:26,719
basing that on any kind of scientific

2785
01:52:24,359 --> 01:52:29,799
information I'm just logically in my

2786
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:32,000
head it just seems very plausible that

2787
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:33,520
you're going to get more reoccurring

2788
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,359
hermaphodite traits that are going to

2789
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:38,360
pop up when you're ref feminizing ref

2790
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:39,799
feminizing and ref feminizing um I mean

2791
01:52:38,359 --> 01:52:42,839
I know a lot of these guys are using

2792
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:46,279
feminized you know fenos and reversing

2793
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:49,360
them to make further lines um a lot of

2794
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:50,840
them aren't having issues right now but

2795
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:52,319
I mean you got to think like some of

2796
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:54,239
these clone ones maybe some of these

2797
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:58,639
chem look at the chems you know those

2798
01:52:54,238 --> 01:53:00,279
were bag seeds so that was a Herm or

2799
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:02,719
some kind of possible pollen that

2800
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:04,479
floated around but if you talk to you

2801
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,960
know I believe Kem even said like there

2802
01:53:04,479 --> 01:53:07,439
were all every seed that he popped was a

2803
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:09,599
female so what are the odds of that

2804
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:12,960
being you know a pollen donor you know

2805
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:16,319
from the dog bud or whatever the uh the

2806
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:19,118
mythical pem line was

2807
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:20,759
um yeah I think that if you kind of work

2808
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:23,399
that long enough for enough years that

2809
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:26,159
you're going to fall into some kind of

2810
01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:27,879
issue um traditional breeding shouldn't

2811
01:53:26,158 --> 01:53:29,399
be like completely abandoned I think

2812
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,599
there's definitely always a place for it

2813
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:32,679
especially with

2814
01:53:30,599 --> 01:53:34,800
preservation

2815
01:53:32,679 --> 01:53:36,599
um I think it's just something people

2816
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:39,000
got to be careful about and make sure

2817
01:53:36,599 --> 01:53:41,000
they don't isolate too much of a

2818
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,520
hermaphodite trait in the lines that

2819
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,679
they're

2820
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:47,320
doing of course yeah it sounds like a a

2821
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:48,679
reasonable point and that's what my

2822
01:53:47,319 --> 01:53:50,238
thoughts have been is you know maybe we

2823
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:53,239
don't see it now but maybe is here it

2824
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:56,039
down the track but to help antidote that

2825
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:58,198
I'd love to know what do you like to

2826
01:53:56,039 --> 01:54:01,359
select for in a male is there any

2827
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:02,960
particular traits you look for or do you

2828
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,719
feel like you know I guess maybe a

2829
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:06,480
better way to put it is for you is it an

2830
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:08,359
art or a science is it things you're

2831
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:09,839
looking for or is it more of a feel and

2832
01:54:08,359 --> 01:54:12,198
you know certain males you're like this

2833
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,760
one's talking to me so it's like a

2834
01:54:12,198 --> 01:54:16,638
little bit of both it's like a sweet

2835
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:18,920
spot in between um like I won't use a

2836
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:20,960
mail that I don't feel something toward

2837
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:23,279
you know some kind like pull

2838
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:26,679
gravitational pull of me wanting to use

2839
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:28,800
it um I'll flower out sometimes I'll

2840
01:54:26,679 --> 01:54:30,319
flower out multiple males I want to see

2841
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,560
what the flower sets look like I want to

2842
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:33,559
see how they stretch I want to see

2843
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,280
certain qualities that that you you know

2844
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:37,880
wouldn't know if you didn't flower them

2845
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:40,198
out um in my lines I never use multiple

2846
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:42,920
males I always use one but I'll save

2847
01:54:40,198 --> 01:54:44,519
like the best three because if I use a

2848
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:46,319
male and I'm like you know what this

2849
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:48,320
didn't you know translate to The

2850
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:51,000
Offspring how I wanted it to let's let's

2851
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:54,399
try a different mail so I'll I'll remake

2852
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:57,639
it oh I just look for you know I I look

2853
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:59,879
for you know a structure I want to see

2854
01:54:57,639 --> 01:55:02,078
stress test I want to see drought test I

2855
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:05,880
want to see stem rub I wanna you know

2856
01:55:02,078 --> 01:55:08,840
what I mean um certain Leaf set um

2857
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:11,560
certain markers that I see

2858
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:15,119
um that I think would be like

2859
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:19,760
stressers um stuff like that it's really

2860
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:21,679
like a guessing game but with a safety

2861
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,520
because you have other males you can use

2862
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:26,118
you

2863
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:28,480
know yeah certainly I remember you know

2864
01:55:26,118 --> 01:55:30,359
uh DJ Short expressed the sentiment that

2865
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:32,238
you know he sort of felt like ultimately

2866
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:34,158
it was just about popping the seeds and

2867
01:55:32,238 --> 01:55:36,559
then that was how you decided if it was

2868
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:39,238
a good male or not do you feel like that

2869
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,920
in a sense is where it leaves you

2870
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:43,319
absolutely man shout out DJ Short the

2871
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:45,359
guy [ __ ] is amazing there you go I

2872
01:55:43,319 --> 01:55:46,920
love it I love it okay so we got a few

2873
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:49,078
more of your lines I definitely wanted

2874
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,078
to touch on but before I name any

2875
01:55:49,078 --> 01:55:53,840
specific ones I want to draw some out of

2876
01:55:51,078 --> 01:55:56,118
you which is the first question being

2877
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,760
what out of your lines do you feel was

2878
01:55:56,118 --> 01:56:01,399
the most unexpectedly successful you

2879
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:07,599
know a bit of a Dark Horse so to

2880
01:56:01,399 --> 01:56:09,479
speak um I used obam cush and I hit the

2881
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:12,319
I hit it with the Donnie burger and some

2882
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:14,718
of those fenals that came out were like

2883
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:19,679
this mothball kind of

2884
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:22,319
like Fruity mothball kind of just crazy

2885
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:24,440
tpine profile it was the most like one

2886
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:26,840
of the most overlooked genetic crosses

2887
01:56:24,439 --> 01:56:29,399
that I made it was just

2888
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:32,000
like people needed to really like hunt

2889
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:34,078
those properly like do like proper

2890
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,560
selections on them not everything that

2891
01:56:34,078 --> 01:56:41,319
came out of that line was like just epic

2892
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:42,960
but some of it was just like amazing

2893
01:56:41,319 --> 01:56:45,679
like I was I was just mindblown by some

2894
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:48,480
of it um the obam cush is like in the in

2895
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:50,279
the FR have you ever had the obam cush

2896
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:52,198
uh we to I think I think there's two

2897
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:54,319
right there's the one from CSI and then

2898
01:56:52,198 --> 01:56:55,399
there's the other one I think I've had

2899
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:58,118
the one from

2900
01:56:55,399 --> 01:57:01,118
CSI okay so I think I think originally

2901
01:56:58,118 --> 01:57:03,039
it came from maybe some of his stock or

2902
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:05,519
it was an accidental cross that somebody

2903
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:07,719
got a seed in some of his

2904
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:09,840
flower it's like uh I think it's like

2905
01:57:07,719 --> 01:57:12,039
meno per cross with like Bubba I think

2906
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:14,719
is what it is yeah that's the one I've

2907
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:17,000
had okay that is how did you feel about

2908
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:19,800
it did you like it yeah it was awesome

2909
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,800
like real chocolatey awesome vibes yeah

2910
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:25,360
I love I love that one um use that one

2911
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:27,599
and just you know like The Offspring was

2912
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:29,000
just was just epic in it man it was just

2913
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:31,199
I didn't expect it to be as good as it

2914
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,439
was it wound up when I tested the seeds

2915
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:36,638
it was just uh it was really

2916
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:38,238
unique Ah that's cool and it brings up

2917
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:41,000
this question I've asked people in the

2918
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:42,439
past which is where do you delineate

2919
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,158
between something you're happy to put

2920
01:57:42,439 --> 01:57:47,598
out and something you're not which is

2921
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:51,039
like let's say you made a cross and 50%

2922
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:53,239
of the seeds are like five like everyone

2923
01:57:51,039 --> 01:57:55,960
unanimously would say this is a keeper

2924
01:57:53,238 --> 01:57:59,039
this is incredible the other 50% of the

2925
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:01,239
pack Herms consistantly would you feel

2926
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:02,840
comfortable putting a pack like that out

2927
01:58:01,238 --> 01:58:05,039
like where do you draw the line between

2928
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:06,800
something that's good versus like or

2929
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:09,599
only some of the plants are good and

2930
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:13,960
some of them may be a bit you know not

2931
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:16,319
ideal so the Herm thing is is a is an

2932
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:21,078
issue for me like I wouldn't put out a

2933
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:23,559
line that was like a 50% Herm um

2934
01:58:21,078 --> 01:58:26,559
now 50% of what comes out of it being

2935
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:28,079
good and 50% not being great I would

2936
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,639
just put that as a disclosure and I'd be

2937
01:58:28,078 --> 01:58:31,559
like the stuff that came out of it that

2938
01:58:29,639 --> 01:58:33,199
was good was so [ __ ] amazing like you

2939
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:35,639
guys really need to to crack through

2940
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:37,879
these beans it's it's worth the half

2941
01:58:35,639 --> 01:58:41,239
that aren't good to get the other half

2942
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:43,480
you know but the Herm trade and in that

2943
01:58:41,238 --> 01:58:44,919
thing is just it's difficult because

2944
01:58:43,479 --> 01:58:46,718
some people don't have a lot of space

2945
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:48,279
and you don't want to burn people like

2946
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:49,679
that and I've seen I've seen some

2947
01:58:48,279 --> 01:58:50,759
breeders put out some stuff and they

2948
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,639
they give people heads up and they're

2949
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:56,280
like hey look you know like I made this

2950
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:57,719
genetic cross I made this line um Herms

2951
01:58:56,279 --> 01:59:00,238
have popped up like is is something that

2952
01:58:57,719 --> 01:59:01,800
you guys want to see how would you feel

2953
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:03,158
about me releasing it you know and I've

2954
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:04,520
seen it I've seen breeders like reach

2955
01:59:03,158 --> 01:59:06,479
out and ask the people and they're like

2956
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:08,679
oh well you know if it's if what's good

2957
01:59:06,479 --> 01:59:11,039
is good then you know it's you know it's

2958
01:59:08,679 --> 01:59:12,800
worth it and whatever so I don't know

2959
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:14,399
there's like I guess a fine line there

2960
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,360
where I guess if you tell people what it

2961
01:59:14,399 --> 01:59:18,879
is and and the issues that you're having

2962
01:59:16,359 --> 01:59:21,639
with a line but for me I just I just

2963
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:24,078
stay from it I don't need that kind of

2964
01:59:21,639 --> 01:59:25,719
problem and you know not everybody's you

2965
01:59:24,078 --> 01:59:27,279
know fluent on social media where they

2966
01:59:25,719 --> 01:59:29,480
see everything that's posted and if

2967
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:31,158
somebody just goes on a on a seed bank

2968
01:59:29,479 --> 01:59:32,598
or on a website and they buy something

2969
01:59:31,158 --> 01:59:34,960
and they don't know the potential you

2970
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:36,360
know harm that can do their Garden I

2971
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,960
would just I would hate to be somebody

2972
01:59:36,359 --> 01:59:39,238
that ruins somebody's time like that

2973
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:41,960
growing should be

2974
01:59:39,238 --> 01:59:44,598
fun to eliminate as much problem for the

2975
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:46,840
consumer as possible is just it's the

2976
01:59:44,599 --> 01:59:50,199
only honest way to do any of this

2977
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:52,760
now yeah totally totally so so I mean on

2978
01:59:50,198 --> 01:59:54,960
that same sort of line of question if

2979
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:56,920
you could only recommend one of your

2980
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,800
packs to someone without knowing

2981
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:01,359
anything about them which pack would you

2982
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,960
recommend and I guess the easy way to

2983
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:05,479
think of this is what's just a general

2984
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:07,439
sort of I don't I don't want to use the

2985
02:00:05,479 --> 02:00:09,359
word cookie cutter but like what's

2986
02:00:07,439 --> 02:00:11,000
something where you think most everyone

2987
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:14,198
would be pretty stoked with what they

2988
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,078
got from it so I would be like if if

2989
02:00:14,198 --> 02:00:17,919
everything was available you know I I

2990
02:00:16,078 --> 02:00:20,359
only make genetic crosses once so

2991
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:23,039
whatever I get yield Pro seed wise out

2992
02:00:20,359 --> 02:00:24,559
of it I'll never remake A genetic cross

2993
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:27,279
um it's just my way of keeping things

2994
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,760
unique but if if it was all the same and

2995
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:30,078
I had unlimited amounts of everything I

2996
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:33,239
would tell everyone to run the Han Solo

2997
02:00:30,078 --> 02:00:35,238
Burger because um that's just that's

2998
02:00:33,238 --> 02:00:37,479
something special for me you know that's

2999
02:00:35,238 --> 02:00:39,319
it's got the GMO in it which has got its

3000
02:00:37,479 --> 02:00:42,198
place in my heart and and it's got the

3001
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:43,719
the Larry OG line um that I worked on

3002
02:00:42,198 --> 02:00:45,839
for so long and it's just kind of like

3003
02:00:43,719 --> 02:00:49,679
its first mashup of those two where they

3004
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:51,360
where they met and just the section on

3005
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:53,359
there and the range of fenos that popped

3006
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:55,198
up were so great that's like if you if

3007
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:56,399
you just if you're a OG Kush lover there

3008
02:00:55,198 --> 02:00:58,559
was there was plenty of that in there

3009
02:00:56,399 --> 02:01:00,879
for you if you loved chem there's plenty

3010
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:03,560
of that in there for you and it's

3011
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:06,039
just it's just it would be my go-to I

3012
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:08,119
guess to be like if if you want to see

3013
02:01:06,039 --> 02:01:11,599
what skunk House's backbone is like this

3014
02:01:08,118 --> 02:01:13,639
is this is us represented in seed I love

3015
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:15,920
that I love that well I wanted to touch

3016
02:01:13,639 --> 02:01:17,840
on um a few more of your strains that

3017
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,599
had been particularly notable for me

3018
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,159
this one's going to be a bit of an

3019
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:22,800
extended question but I feel like I got

3020
02:01:21,158 --> 02:01:25,238
to get it all out there to help lay the

3021
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:27,199
ground workor so um I want to know a

3022
02:01:25,238 --> 02:01:29,359
little bit about the Mike Larry and how

3023
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:32,279
it came about but specifically you know

3024
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:34,158
the followup is obviously this one made

3025
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:36,439
a lot of waves in the water it was

3026
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:38,799
picked up by jungle boys they ran with

3027
02:01:36,439 --> 02:01:41,000
it so the followup question is how much

3028
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:43,199
of a boost does that give to your

3029
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,198
company to have someone like jungle boys

3030
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:47,319
running with one of your strains so yeah

3031
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:49,039
how did it come about Mike Larry and how

3032
02:01:47,319 --> 02:01:52,479
did it get picked up by jungle boys and

3033
02:01:49,039 --> 02:01:54,519
what effect did that have so with the

3034
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:57,238
Mike Larry um and with a lot of genics

3035
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:59,800
that I actually put out I'm really like

3036
02:01:57,238 --> 02:02:01,678
like pop culture kind of like infused

3037
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:03,880
into cannabis and it's where I get a lot

3038
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:06,920
of my ideas for names and and just kind

3039
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:10,359
of directions and you know like Han Solo

3040
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:11,440
bger and Mike Larry and just just just a

3041
02:02:10,359 --> 02:02:15,078
lot of

3042
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:17,559
these things that are kind of

3043
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:20,158
like I don't know bringing art and

3044
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:22,760
bringing pop culture into cannabis is

3045
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:26,078
kind of like it's that's like my

3046
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:30,719
backbone and

3047
02:02:26,078 --> 02:02:32,759
um I guess the most easy way to describe

3048
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:35,719
it is like you know I'm a I'm a

3049
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:39,280
cultivator myself so I sit around a trim

3050
02:02:35,719 --> 02:02:41,760
table and Bs With Buddies while we're

3051
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:43,439
you know spending hours and hours and

3052
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:45,760
just kind of like go off on crazy you

3053
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:47,839
know talking tangents and we listen to

3054
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,320
music in the background and there's you

3055
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,679
know sometimes movies playing in the

3056
02:02:49,319 --> 02:02:54,118
background and sometimes that stuff in

3057
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:59,000
the background is is the influence to

3058
02:02:54,118 --> 02:03:02,238
where I get um names and and ideas from

3059
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:05,760
and um the Mike Larry was

3060
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:07,678
just it was Larry OG and there was bad

3061
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:09,480
boys playing in the background the movie

3062
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:12,279
when we were when we were trimming fenos

3063
02:03:09,479 --> 02:03:14,118
of it and uh you know just him saying

3064
02:03:12,279 --> 02:03:15,479
I'm Mike Larry and over and over again

3065
02:03:14,118 --> 02:03:17,880
you know I'm like this is just this is

3066
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:20,759
the Mike Larry you know

3067
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:22,880
this just some goofball stuff like that

3068
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:25,000
you know like that's there's nothing

3069
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:28,400
crazy like wildly creative about it it

3070
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:30,639
was just um kind of like put in my head

3071
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:34,000
and then it came

3072
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:35,560
out that's cool I love it and like how

3073
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,078
did the cross come to be was it

3074
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:39,119
something you were thinking about on

3075
02:03:37,078 --> 02:03:41,439
paper for a long time and then finally

3076
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:43,118
did or was it one of those ones where

3077
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:45,399
you know it was just in the mix and then

3078
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:48,719
it sort of stepped forward as a real

3079
02:03:45,399 --> 02:03:49,839
front runner it was um there was a bunch

3080
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:53,639
of you know there's a bunch of different

3081
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:55,239
gelato and um I had I had done the cross

3082
02:03:53,639 --> 02:03:59,400
um with a few different variations

3083
02:03:55,238 --> 02:04:01,558
different gelato cuts and um there was a

3084
02:03:59,399 --> 02:04:05,479
few that really popped out that really

3085
02:04:01,559 --> 02:04:07,960
mixed well with the with the Larry

3086
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:10,039
um I think I and over at jungle boys

3087
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:11,960
kind of recognized that I tossed him a

3088
02:04:10,039 --> 02:04:15,800
bunch of different seed stock that I

3089
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:17,319
made he wanted to do a collab and U you

3090
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:19,320
know that one stood out to those guys

3091
02:04:17,319 --> 02:04:21,519
when they ran it and you know he said

3092
02:04:19,319 --> 02:04:25,639
why don't we do a uh why don't we do a

3093
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:28,320
TK BX you know I'll take your uh your TK

3094
02:04:25,639 --> 02:04:30,199
Larry um triangle Larry and and I'll

3095
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:33,639
I'll cross it back to the TK and we'll

3096
02:04:30,198 --> 02:04:35,359
do a a mail line with that and um we

3097
02:04:33,639 --> 02:04:36,559
really like this Mike Larry line and

3098
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:39,439
we'd like to use it in a bunch of

3099
02:04:36,559 --> 02:04:41,039
crosses and I said cool let's let's run

3100
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:43,319
with it let's see what you you know

3101
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:46,198
let's see what we can come up with and

3102
02:04:43,319 --> 02:04:49,198
uh that's pretty much uh how the jungle

3103
02:04:46,198 --> 02:04:51,238
boys collab went down that's killer to

3104
02:04:49,198 --> 02:04:54,039
hear that you know they they recognize

3105
02:04:51,238 --> 02:04:56,519
the the potential it had and I guess as

3106
02:04:54,039 --> 02:04:58,800
a as a general sort of marketing sort of

3107
02:04:56,520 --> 02:05:01,040
angle what what effect does that have on

3108
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:03,520
a company to have jungle boys pick it up

3109
02:05:01,039 --> 02:05:06,519
my gut instinct is that it it helps

3110
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:08,360
expose you to a whole new demographic of

3111
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:10,239
consumers but maybe that's not

3112
02:05:08,359 --> 02:05:12,198
necessarily the case how do you feel

3113
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:14,558
that that collab sort of affected your

3114
02:05:12,198 --> 02:05:19,198
overall popularity and

3115
02:05:14,559 --> 02:05:23,559
notoriety uh definitely positive um I

3116
02:05:19,198 --> 02:05:25,078
is a beast in the industry um anybody

3117
02:05:23,559 --> 02:05:30,520
that would say otherwise is just lying

3118
02:05:25,078 --> 02:05:32,279
to themselves um he sets Trends they you

3119
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:36,880
know the jungle boys do their thing for

3120
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:39,559
sure man um that collab definitely took

3121
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,920
some of their their viewer base that

3122
02:05:39,559 --> 02:05:44,199
didn't recognize or didn't know who I

3123
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:46,679
was um and kind of shined a little bit

3124
02:05:44,198 --> 02:05:49,238
of light on that

3125
02:05:46,679 --> 02:05:50,719
um and then outside of what it did or

3126
02:05:49,238 --> 02:05:53,479
what it didn't do for me it was just

3127
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:55,960
kind of cool to work with um another Big

3128
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:58,359
Industry guy and and that was really my

3129
02:05:55,960 --> 02:06:02,239
first collab I ever did

3130
02:05:58,359 --> 02:06:03,960
so it was kind of you I was lucky on my

3131
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:06,118
half that I got to you know be part of

3132
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:09,480
something that

3133
02:06:06,118 --> 02:06:11,519
cool yeah hugely hugely and um I just

3134
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:13,839
wanted to quickly clarify you know cuz I

3135
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:16,840
I have seen a number of um the jungle

3136
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:19,159
boys seed releases and there is that TK

3137
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:20,880
back cross mail in the mix is that the

3138
02:06:19,158 --> 02:06:24,198
male that you were referring to that

3139
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:27,920
they built off that Mike Larry stock

3140
02:06:24,198 --> 02:06:31,879
yeah so the TK bx1 is um I had made um

3141
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:33,000
TK crossed with Larry uh backat cross

3142
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:37,000
one

3143
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:39,319
f8 um I gave them seeds of that they

3144
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,920
found a killer mail they crossed it back

3145
02:06:39,319 --> 02:06:44,558
to the triangle cush and then they

3146
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:46,840
hunted through stock of that and then

3147
02:06:44,559 --> 02:06:49,599
did their line based off of their

3148
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:51,719
find that's pretty cool I mean I guess

3149
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:53,319
it opens the door to a followup question

3150
02:06:51,719 --> 02:06:55,000
which is you know how do you feel about

3151
02:06:53,319 --> 02:06:56,880
people breeding with your work cuz I

3152
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:58,679
think the majority of people are usually

3153
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:00,760
pretty okay with it but sometimes people

3154
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:04,199
have certain requests where do you sit

3155
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:06,360
on that one specifically we did get a a

3156
02:07:04,198 --> 02:07:08,279
message from one of our listeners who

3157
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:10,279
said that um you know they popped a

3158
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:12,238
single pack of Donny Burger found what

3159
02:07:10,279 --> 02:07:14,078
they think is like a unicorn just a

3160
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:16,638
really special plant they said great

3161
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:19,960
structure incredible growth good yield

3162
02:07:16,639 --> 02:07:21,599
deep funky smells test high would you

3163
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:22,760
have any issues with people breeding

3164
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:24,840
with your

3165
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,719
work um

3166
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:29,440
the the only thing that I where I stand

3167
02:07:27,719 --> 02:07:31,078
with that whole thing is like the only

3168
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:32,598
thing I would want to see out of people

3169
02:07:31,078 --> 02:07:33,960
if they're going to use any work is just

3170
02:07:32,599 --> 02:07:36,199
for them to put their own unique Twist

3171
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:37,840
on it I mean I I think it's awesome when

3172
02:07:36,198 --> 02:07:41,519
I see people use stuff that I've made

3173
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:44,078
it's it's like contributing to the uh

3174
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,719
the industry you know what I mean um I'm

3175
02:07:44,078 --> 02:07:50,439
I'm glad and I'm lucky I'm able to do my

3176
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:52,559
part um but I do love to see when people

3177
02:07:50,439 --> 02:07:54,879
actually take something that I did and

3178
02:07:52,559 --> 02:07:57,679
kind of put their Twist on it I think

3179
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:59,440
that makes it like just that much better

3180
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:01,520
and more refreshing than seeing somebody

3181
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:05,598
just take somebody's work and like make

3182
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:07,679
f2s or find a male and then just dust a

3183
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:10,760
bunch of Clone ones with a mail they

3184
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:12,559
found and then release the seeds you

3185
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:14,000
know I don't I don't have any issues

3186
02:08:12,559 --> 02:08:16,079
with either one of them regardless it

3187
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,238
doesn't it doesn't really bother me but

3188
02:08:16,078 --> 02:08:20,198
on a on an artistic standpoint I I mean

3189
02:08:18,238 --> 02:08:23,000
I I think it's just way more flattering

3190
02:08:20,198 --> 02:08:25,000
when somebody says your work was so good

3191
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:28,039
I wanted to put my own twist on it and

3192
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:32,599
then seeing what they do with it

3193
02:08:28,039 --> 02:08:34,960
is to me that's just the highest

3194
02:08:32,599 --> 02:08:37,159
compliment yeah that's awesome to hear

3195
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:40,800
you know hoping that it inspires some

3196
02:08:37,158 --> 02:08:43,078
Innovation so another strain I wanted to

3197
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:44,279
touch on was the modified banana line

3198
02:08:43,078 --> 02:08:45,719
and the reason why you know our

3199
02:08:44,279 --> 02:08:48,039
listeners are probably sick to death of

3200
02:08:45,719 --> 02:08:49,920
me saying it banana OG one of my

3201
02:08:48,039 --> 02:08:51,760
favorite I feel like it's super under

3202
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:53,279
represented especially banana as a

3203
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,320
flavor you know you don't see it as

3204
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:56,920
often as you might hope can you tell us

3205
02:08:55,319 --> 02:08:58,558
a little bit about the modified banana

3206
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:01,440
line and how you might describe it to

3207
02:08:58,559 --> 02:09:04,159
people I love the banana OG it's like

3208
02:09:01,439 --> 02:09:06,638
one of my favorites um I never get sick

3209
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:10,319
of it it

3210
02:09:06,639 --> 02:09:12,359
was not even a thought in my head um

3211
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:15,920
when I was doing a bunch of the burger

3212
02:09:12,359 --> 02:09:19,399
lines to somehow work a banana into that

3213
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:21,760
um I thought that cross came out Epic

3214
02:09:19,399 --> 02:09:25,960
uh we do a selection here for the legal

3215
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:28,599
market and um in Michigan of the banana

3216
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:32,319
and it is just it's killer it's strong

3217
02:09:28,599 --> 02:09:34,279
it has great flavor it produces well um

3218
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:38,319
it's an all-around winner and

3219
02:09:34,279 --> 02:09:40,759
just like you man I'm just a huge huge

3220
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:41,679
banana OG fan you know shout out to

3221
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:45,840
Oregon

3222
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:48,039
kid yeah 100% 100% so what sort of

3223
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,039
plants can people expect to get if they

3224
02:09:48,039 --> 02:09:51,960
buy any of those crosses cuz I noticed

3225
02:09:50,039 --> 02:09:53,679
that um you know there's still a few

3226
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,760
seed banks who stock your work who have

3227
02:09:53,679 --> 02:09:57,559
got a healthy amount of stock and that's

3228
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:58,880
one of the criticisms we get of the show

3229
02:09:57,559 --> 02:10:01,079
you know we talk about all these awesome

3230
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,359
strines that they're all sold out so

3231
02:10:01,078 --> 02:10:03,759
thought we better touch on something

3232
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:05,198
where they can still grab it you know

3233
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,559
how might you pitch some of those

3234
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:10,279
hybrids or in general what traits do you

3235
02:10:07,559 --> 02:10:14,599
feel the modified banana M brings to

3236
02:10:10,279 --> 02:10:16,960
things it's like a rotten banana peel

3237
02:10:14,599 --> 02:10:19,639
you know like that's the Turing profile

3238
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:21,319
that I would I would say describes it it

3239
02:10:19,639 --> 02:10:22,920
definitely has that banana peel to it

3240
02:10:21,319 --> 02:10:25,799
though

3241
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:30,239
um it lends it lends in some of the

3242
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:32,719
yield the plant yields very solid um

3243
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:34,439
it's not super picky with feed so you

3244
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:36,359
can kind of like you know Juice It Up

3245
02:10:34,439 --> 02:10:39,039
and not have to worry about like you

3246
02:10:36,359 --> 02:10:44,039
know overdoing it it can kind of take a

3247
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:47,319
decent feed decent heavy feed

3248
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:49,880
um if you like banana OG you're GNA like

3249
02:10:47,319 --> 02:10:51,960
that banana line it's just that banana

3250
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:55,400
comes through so much on it it's it's

3251
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:57,639
hard not to appreciate it oh man that's

3252
02:10:55,399 --> 02:11:00,479
gorgeous to hear cuz I I have ran a few

3253
02:10:57,639 --> 02:11:02,359
banana OG hybrids over the years and I

3254
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:04,519
feel like it was hard to get a banana

3255
02:11:02,359 --> 02:11:06,000
dominant expression out of them is this

3256
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:08,559
something you ever

3257
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,039
heard um yeah because it's you know the

3258
02:11:08,559 --> 02:11:13,400
banana in there is not like really

3259
02:11:10,039 --> 02:11:14,840
really heavy heavy hitting so um a lot

3260
02:11:13,399 --> 02:11:16,479
of times whatever you're working with

3261
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,800
genetically and Crossing it to it kind

3262
02:11:16,479 --> 02:11:21,479
of like Powers over that now you taste

3263
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:24,119
is kind of like a like the cushy kind of

3264
02:11:21,479 --> 02:11:27,078
you know standard kind of oish kind of

3265
02:11:24,118 --> 02:11:29,839
[ __ ] thing but um I did a back to

3266
02:11:27,078 --> 02:11:32,880
banana cross which is banana OG crossed

3267
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:37,679
with modified banana and that yielded

3268
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:40,800
out some massive banana OG plants um

3269
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:43,760
great buds great structure great

3270
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:45,520
turpine um arguably if you hunted enough

3271
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:49,320
of them you'd find something even more

3272
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:51,199
banana than the actual banana um

3273
02:11:49,319 --> 02:11:52,479
but just really cool if anybody ever

3274
02:11:51,198 --> 02:11:54,719
comes across those and they're still

3275
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:55,959
available like grab them and and just

3276
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:59,319
enjoy the [ __ ] out of them because

3277
02:11:55,960 --> 02:12:01,359
they're they were so much fun to to run

3278
02:11:59,319 --> 02:12:03,158
oh that's excellent to hear I love it I

3279
02:12:01,359 --> 02:12:04,719
forgot to ask you a question a moment

3280
02:12:03,158 --> 02:12:06,118
ago when we were talking about the Mike

3281
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:09,000
Larry but we did have one of our

3282
02:12:06,118 --> 02:12:11,399
listeners ask what sort of traits SL

3283
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,319
plants can they expect to find in the

3284
02:12:11,399 --> 02:12:15,920
Mike Larry hybrids I think they were

3285
02:12:13,319 --> 02:12:19,198
eyeing off a few of them any you'd

3286
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:21,279
recommend yeah so uh we i' offered the

3287
02:12:19,198 --> 02:12:25,000
straight mikee Larry

3288
02:12:21,279 --> 02:12:26,238
V2s um the V2s I thought were better

3289
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,840
than the

3290
02:12:26,238 --> 02:12:32,879
v1s because I liked the gelato that I

3291
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:35,800
used in it better uh the V1 the original

3292
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:39,279
Mike Larry used the gelato 45 um which

3293
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:41,440
was solid it was a solid plant um but

3294
02:12:39,279 --> 02:12:44,198
the V2s I used the gelato

3295
02:12:41,439 --> 02:12:47,638
41 and that one I thought was a lot more

3296
02:12:44,198 --> 02:12:51,638
unique and kind of brought more to the

3297
02:12:47,639 --> 02:12:53,760
table and the cross also it wasn't just

3298
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:56,319
the Larry OG in that I used the Paris

3299
02:12:53,760 --> 02:13:02,639
Larry which was Paris OG crossed with

3300
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:07,519
Larry um f8 and I thought that male kind

3301
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:11,118
of brought more of the traditional Kush

3302
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:13,040
so if you can find the the Mike Larry

3303
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:14,799
V2s I don't I don't know if there's any

3304
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:19,719
still available or floating around there

3305
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:22,119
but those were pretty amazing um

3306
02:13:19,719 --> 02:13:24,439
some of the Mike Larry

3307
02:13:22,118 --> 02:13:27,118
crosses um I haven't really messed

3308
02:13:24,439 --> 02:13:29,759
around crazy crazy amounts with the V2

3309
02:13:27,118 --> 02:13:32,679
crosses that was something that

3310
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:36,840
respected um so I personally didn't you

3311
02:13:32,679 --> 02:13:39,118
know make or run those um

3312
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:40,800
but I could only imagine that there's

3313
02:13:39,118 --> 02:13:43,960
some killer stuff in

3314
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:46,199
them yeah certainly certainly I did

3315
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:49,359
notice that you'd use the Paris OG and a

3316
02:13:46,198 --> 02:13:51,039
few hybrids and I I wanted to ask you

3317
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:54,039
was there anything specific about the

3318
02:13:51,039 --> 02:13:56,479
Paris OG that really Drew you to it yeah

3319
02:13:54,039 --> 02:13:58,920
it was just um you know the Paris OG was

3320
02:13:56,479 --> 02:14:00,678
like a really I like enjoyed it as like

3321
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:02,279
an OG Kush lover it was just a really

3322
02:14:00,679 --> 02:14:03,399
unique kind of OG it kind of

3323
02:14:02,279 --> 02:14:05,599
structurally grew a little bit

3324
02:14:03,399 --> 02:14:08,719
differently it wasn't so lengthy it was

3325
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:10,559
a little bit more Stout um so I thought

3326
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:13,840
that kind of trait was cool from

3327
02:14:10,559 --> 02:14:15,199
aush um when I made the cross and I

3328
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:17,159
hunted through the original Paris

3329
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:18,719
Larry's I just noticed that it kind of

3330
02:14:17,158 --> 02:14:22,759
was bringing up a bunch different type

3331
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:25,359
of kind of like OG Kush um clone only

3332
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:27,400
you know traits from like some of the

3333
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:29,238
Louie traits and some of the you know

3334
02:14:27,399 --> 02:14:31,598
some of those other ones that I didn't

3335
02:14:29,238 --> 02:14:34,399
even work with

3336
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:36,078
so I think it kind of was I don't know

3337
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:38,439
like a like an amazing tool you know to

3338
02:14:36,078 --> 02:14:40,759
use in a hybrid and kind of just like

3339
02:14:38,439 --> 02:14:44,399
brought the Best of Both Worlds and and

3340
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:46,880
didn't overpower the gelato and kind of

3341
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:48,439
brought its own you know OG and just

3342
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:50,000
kind of just you know know just really

3343
02:14:48,439 --> 02:14:53,799
unique and it was just really fun to

3344
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:56,039
grow fun plants nice nice and like as a

3345
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:58,320
followup to this I noticed that the uh

3346
02:14:56,039 --> 02:15:00,319
the Mikey mic was pretty similar in

3347
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:02,479
terms of the genetic combination it had

3348
02:15:00,319 --> 02:15:04,479
a lot of real All Stars in there you

3349
02:15:02,479 --> 02:15:07,198
know between the gelato the Paris OG and

3350
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:09,519
the Larry OG and interestingly I noticed

3351
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:11,198
you know you bred it to the F2 and I

3352
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:13,159
guess I wanted to ask was there any

3353
02:15:11,198 --> 02:15:14,839
particular reason you decided to Philly

3354
02:15:13,158 --> 02:15:16,439
or breed this one forward were there any

3355
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:18,319
sort of goals you were looking to hit or

3356
02:15:16,439 --> 02:15:20,759
was it just a cool line

3357
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:25,759
uh so the Mikey Mike was just Mike Larry

3358
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:29,559
F2 um that was a that was a respect

3359
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:32,440
cross um I wasn't involved in the

3360
02:15:29,559 --> 02:15:35,279
breeding of that so that would be kind

3361
02:15:32,439 --> 02:15:36,960
of like more like a his him question on

3362
02:15:35,279 --> 02:15:39,439
that one

3363
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:42,359
um I don't know if he was breeding it

3364
02:15:39,439 --> 02:15:44,198
toward certain traits or I'm not really

3365
02:15:42,359 --> 02:15:47,158
sure exactly what he was looking to get

3366
02:15:44,198 --> 02:15:50,879
out of that one um probably just more

3367
02:15:47,158 --> 02:15:52,399
isolated uh whatever fale that he was he

3368
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:56,039
thought was good I

3369
02:15:52,399 --> 02:15:58,000
guess yeah sure and do you guys uh tend

3370
02:15:56,039 --> 02:16:00,039
to do crosses

3371
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,439
independently um how does the whole

3372
02:16:00,039 --> 02:16:05,559
collaboration process work with you

3373
02:16:02,439 --> 02:16:08,558
two um so for years I was the only one

3374
02:16:05,559 --> 02:16:11,480
that was pretty much producing seed uh

3375
02:16:08,559 --> 02:16:12,840
he had an outdoor space that was larger

3376
02:16:11,479 --> 02:16:16,959
that he was able to

3377
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:21,719
utilize um so he did a couple of lines

3378
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:26,239
he did uh the lemon lime orange apricot

3379
02:16:21,719 --> 02:16:30,158
um it was a smaller project he

3380
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:32,840
did some double burger crosses and then

3381
02:16:30,158 --> 02:16:34,840
he did the Mike Larry the the ones that

3382
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:36,359
dropped this year the Mike Larry's from

3383
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:38,558
this year were pretty much a California

3384
02:16:36,359 --> 02:16:40,000
seed bank trap I didn't have any part of

3385
02:16:38,558 --> 02:16:43,079
those ones at

3386
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,478
all okay cool cool and do you guys

3387
02:16:43,079 --> 02:16:46,920
discuss crosses together as like you

3388
02:16:45,478 --> 02:16:49,558
know I'm going to do this so you should

3389
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:51,679
pursue that or how does that side of it

3390
02:16:49,558 --> 02:16:54,239
work um we did when we were still

3391
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:56,719
working together kind of like brainstorm

3392
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:58,280
and say okay well you know I'm gonna I'm

3393
02:16:56,718 --> 02:16:59,919
gonna go in this direction because this

3394
02:16:58,280 --> 02:17:02,159
is this is what I want to do this is my

3395
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:04,318
passion project and you know he would

3396
02:17:02,159 --> 02:17:06,760
say okay well I you know I want to do

3397
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:09,718
this or whatever and it's like cool you

3398
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:12,920
know make the seeds pop them see what

3399
02:17:09,718 --> 02:17:16,598
you come up with um ultimately at the

3400
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:19,439
end of the day uh we both just kind

3401
02:17:16,599 --> 02:17:21,760
of Envision things differently than one

3402
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:24,719
another so we just kind of parted ways

3403
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:27,960
and um he's doing his California seed

3404
02:17:24,718 --> 02:17:30,079
bank thing and um I'm pursuing the path

3405
02:17:27,959 --> 02:17:33,279
that I wanted to do with the skunk house

3406
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:34,920
originally so yeah yeah that's awesome

3407
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:37,559
to hear that you guys have been able to

3408
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:41,040
sort of leave it on a good note I wanted

3409
02:17:37,558 --> 02:17:43,920
to ask you about a Hot Topic in the

3410
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:45,559
industry at the moment uh something

3411
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:47,439
that's been prevalent in the EU scene

3412
02:17:45,558 --> 02:17:49,239
for a long time but something which is a

3413
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:51,760
bit bit more freshly discussed in the

3414
02:17:49,239 --> 02:17:53,840
Americas which is white labeling of

3415
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:55,599
seeds or more specifically you know

3416
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:56,880
making seeds for other companies and

3417
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:59,398
then just sort of letting them decide

3418
02:17:56,879 --> 02:18:01,679
what they want to do with it I'd love to

3419
02:17:59,398 --> 02:18:03,840
open the door to this discussion because

3420
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:06,159
I believe you have made some seeds for

3421
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:08,120
other breeders in the past what's your

3422
02:18:06,159 --> 02:18:11,079
thoughts on white labeling as just a a

3423
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:12,880
general sort of topic to begin with uh I

3424
02:18:11,079 --> 02:18:14,519
think it's I think it's an acceptable

3425
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:16,879
thing to do these days as long as you're

3426
02:18:14,519 --> 02:18:18,439
just open about it and tell people what

3427
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:20,759
you're doing

3428
02:18:18,439 --> 02:18:25,159
um again it all really falls back on

3429
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:27,079
seed testing um the main concern that I

3430
02:18:25,159 --> 02:18:29,359
think anybody has that's buying seed is

3431
02:18:27,079 --> 02:18:32,318
they want to know are they getting

3432
02:18:29,359 --> 02:18:35,318
viable good tested genetics and I think

3433
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:37,558
as long as that's true on a seed release

3434
02:18:35,318 --> 02:18:40,760
then I don't think anything else really

3435
02:18:37,558 --> 02:18:43,518
much matters if it's authentic it's it's

3436
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:46,559
what the breeder says it is and they're

3437
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:48,760
standing behind their product um I think

3438
02:18:46,558 --> 02:18:50,599
it's all good

3439
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:53,359
yeah certainly certainly I can

3440
02:18:50,599 --> 02:18:55,478
appreciate that sentiment I guess the

3441
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:57,800
follow-up question is like where do you

3442
02:18:55,478 --> 02:18:59,599
draw the line you know so I'll give you

3443
02:18:57,799 --> 02:19:01,119
an example and maybe that'll help you

3444
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:02,679
know flesh out some of the details a

3445
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:05,920
little more but let's just say that you

3446
02:19:02,679 --> 02:19:09,799
know old heavy days buys all his seeds

3447
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:11,519
from skunk Master Flex and um you know I

3448
02:19:09,799 --> 02:19:13,279
on the packs I list all the proper

3449
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:14,760
genetics you know the lineages are all

3450
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,079
correct and all the information is

3451
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:18,800
essentially correct um and then when

3452
02:19:17,079 --> 02:19:21,079
people asked me about them I'm like oh

3453
02:19:18,799 --> 02:19:23,358
you know I made these ones last year

3454
02:19:21,079 --> 02:19:26,000
like I guess the question is at at what

3455
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:27,840
point do you feel like um you're sort of

3456
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:31,159
crossing a line with it you know is it

3457
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:33,880
okay to say you made these seeds if that

3458
02:19:31,159 --> 02:19:36,318
in your opinion is integral to you know

3459
02:19:33,879 --> 02:19:38,518
the sale of the seeds or do you feel

3460
02:19:36,318 --> 02:19:39,638
like you'd have to be just 100% upfront

3461
02:19:38,519 --> 02:19:41,519
and be like oh you know I actually

3462
02:19:39,638 --> 02:19:44,279
didn't make this but like this is what

3463
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:46,200
it is and this is what to expect where

3464
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:49,280
do you sort of draw the line between

3465
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:52,319
like you know Protec businesses sort of

3466
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:53,920
identity versus being upfront about it

3467
02:19:52,318 --> 02:19:59,199
oh that's a tough [ __ ] question man

3468
02:19:53,920 --> 02:20:01,920
good job uh sorry uh I

3469
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:03,280
mean there's I I I feel like there's so

3470
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:05,040
many people in this industry that are

3471
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:08,720
just really not even making their own

3472
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:11,160
seed so I would

3473
02:20:08,719 --> 02:20:14,799
just it's a weird that's a that's a

3474
02:20:11,159 --> 02:20:17,600
that's a great that's a hard question um

3475
02:20:14,799 --> 02:20:22,039
I mean I guess you're if you're being

3476
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:25,040
honest about it then it is what it is

3477
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:25,040
and

3478
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,760
[ __ ] it's that is incredibly tough to

3479
02:20:28,478 --> 02:20:33,719
answer because I feel like you know when

3480
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:36,239
I when I offer seed I want to be

3481
02:20:33,719 --> 02:20:38,840
authentic with people and you know open

3482
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:41,680
about what's going on and uh respect did

3483
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:44,799
some some some seed making for skunk

3484
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:46,800
house and you know he popped up and was

3485
02:20:44,799 --> 02:20:49,438
like Yay made these seeds and people

3486
02:20:46,799 --> 02:20:51,559
were like cool cool and he did it under

3487
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:54,079
skunk house and he'll probably continue

3488
02:20:51,559 --> 02:20:58,199
to do under California seed bank and

3489
02:20:54,079 --> 02:21:00,959
he'll use lines that he worked on and

3490
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:02,680
um he's putting his own twist on it so

3491
02:21:00,959 --> 02:21:05,759
it's you know good for him do whatever

3492
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:08,520
you want um be open about what you're

3493
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:10,800
doing um with some of these like where

3494
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:13,000
where do you draw the line I guess

3495
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:14,239
people have to draw the line I guess as

3496
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,079
a breeder you're not the one that's

3497
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:18,119
drawing the line or the or the company

3498
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:20,439
the one that's Drawing the Line just

3499
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:23,120
you're just offering a service and and

3500
02:21:20,439 --> 02:21:25,559
you let the people I guess decide if if

3501
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:27,439
they want you know seed stock being made

3502
02:21:25,559 --> 02:21:30,639
from who they claim it's being made from

3503
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:33,960
and you know I guess ask the breeder for

3504
02:21:30,639 --> 02:21:36,398
thorough you know information on on how

3505
02:21:33,959 --> 02:21:38,759
the seeds were made and and the process

3506
02:21:36,398 --> 02:21:40,439
and as long as the the consumer can

3507
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:44,600
stomach whatever information they're

3508
02:21:40,439 --> 02:21:46,318
being told then I guess uh I guess

3509
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:48,640
everyone draws Their Own Line of some

3510
02:21:46,318 --> 02:21:51,920
sort

3511
02:21:48,639 --> 02:21:54,439
yeah sure and do you think like this

3512
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:56,719
idea or this sort of concept will expand

3513
02:21:54,439 --> 02:21:58,318
further because as you said there are

3514
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:00,959
some breeders in the industry you know

3515
02:21:58,318 --> 02:22:02,760
I'll use the word Loosely breeders um

3516
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:04,839
who who don't make their own seeds and

3517
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:06,159
so I guess you could say well you know

3518
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:07,960
maybe they're like burner you know

3519
02:22:06,159 --> 02:22:09,879
they're the hype man and they sell the

3520
02:22:07,959 --> 02:22:11,438
product and that's cool so I guess the

3521
02:22:09,879 --> 02:22:13,398
question is do you think that that Trend

3522
02:22:11,439 --> 02:22:15,520
will continue and over time we will see

3523
02:22:13,398 --> 02:22:18,680
people who are like the middleman or the

3524
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:20,680
hype guy and reading becomes you know

3525
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:22,479
more of a back room sort of thing you

3526
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:24,159
know like maybe maybe the analogy is

3527
02:22:22,478 --> 02:22:26,079
like with rappers you know we're going

3528
02:22:24,159 --> 02:22:27,559
to have the rappers on the front and

3529
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:29,359
then the producers in the back room

3530
02:22:27,559 --> 02:22:31,639
doing the hard yards like how do you see

3531
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:33,640
it playing out over the long term

3532
02:22:31,639 --> 02:22:35,920
absolutely I mean the music industry is

3533
02:22:33,639 --> 02:22:40,079
like a perfect reference to using that

3534
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:42,200
um you know like they'll use some super

3535
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:43,600
attractive girl that maybe necessarily

3536
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:45,720
doesn't have a great voice but then

3537
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:49,079
they'll use like a voice synthesizer and

3538
02:22:45,719 --> 02:22:51,079
and you know use a studio and and make

3539
02:22:49,079 --> 02:22:52,559
her sound a certain type of way and then

3540
02:22:51,079 --> 02:22:54,079
you know you hear her live and you're

3541
02:22:52,559 --> 02:22:55,559
like wow it doesn't even sound like the

3542
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:57,520
same person that's you know her voice

3543
02:22:55,559 --> 02:23:01,079
isn't that great you know using that is

3544
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:02,520
obviously just an analogy to you know

3545
02:23:01,079 --> 02:23:04,920
like you said with Burner you have a

3546
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:07,479
front man and you know who's really

3547
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,398
doing the work who's behind the scenes

3548
02:23:07,478 --> 02:23:10,879
um I guess that's part of their whole

3549
02:23:09,398 --> 02:23:14,398
marketing though you know that's that's

3550
02:23:10,879 --> 02:23:16,719
how they're choosing to you know make

3551
02:23:14,398 --> 02:23:17,920
people look at them as as a company like

3552
02:23:16,719 --> 02:23:19,358
you know

3553
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:20,680
don't be interested in the guy making

3554
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:24,120
the seeds be interested in the guy

3555
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:26,439
that's talking about the seeds um I

3556
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:27,520
think it'll continue to happen probably

3557
02:23:26,439 --> 02:23:31,639
something that's been happening for a

3558
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:33,279
long time you know um it's not like Adam

3559
02:23:31,639 --> 02:23:36,119
dund days anymore where it's we got

3560
02:23:33,279 --> 02:23:38,000
these crazy crazy breeders you know that

3561
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:40,079
are just like working these crazy lines

3562
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:42,398
it's there's a lot of F1 stuff coming

3563
02:23:40,079 --> 02:23:44,000
out some people like that and some

3564
02:23:42,398 --> 02:23:45,959
people want stuff that's further work

3565
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:49,159
some people don't want fenes some people

3566
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:51,639
want you know IDL lines and they want to

3567
02:23:49,159 --> 02:23:53,318
see you know f2s f3s f4s before they

3568
02:23:51,639 --> 02:23:55,199
want to really you know dig too far into

3569
02:23:53,318 --> 02:23:59,478
a genetic pool and kind of do some pheno

3570
02:23:55,200 --> 02:24:01,479
hunting um ultimately it's people

3571
02:23:59,478 --> 02:24:05,000
dictate the market so if they keep

3572
02:24:01,478 --> 02:24:06,879
buying things that you know justify or

3573
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,318
don't justify a price tag they're kind

3574
02:24:06,879 --> 02:24:12,879
of they're kind of creating the market

3575
02:24:09,318 --> 02:24:16,159
and legitimizing it

3576
02:24:12,879 --> 02:24:19,079
um so we'll see what people keep buying

3577
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:22,079
and what people stop bu I

3578
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:23,439
guess yeah no I I totally stand behind

3579
02:24:22,079 --> 02:24:26,398
all of that for sure I get what you're

3580
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:28,840
saying no doubt so as a as one that's a

3581
02:24:26,398 --> 02:24:31,719
bit of a I'll give you some specifics

3582
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:35,040
you know I've heard of situations where

3583
02:24:31,719 --> 02:24:37,000
some people get upset that someone else

3584
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,840
has made the seeds on behalf of a

3585
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,840
breeder so I'm not talking about white

3586
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:42,439
labeling let's just say you come around

3587
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:43,920
my place you bring around a bunch of

3588
02:24:42,439 --> 02:24:46,200
plants and you're like hey here's the

3589
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:47,920
male I selected it out I want you to hit

3590
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:49,600
all these femal with it and then you

3591
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:51,439
know we'll have our agreement I'll give

3592
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:54,920
you whatever and we're all happy with

3593
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:56,359
that and then later on you know the the

3594
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:58,359
person will be like well I did the

3595
02:24:56,359 --> 02:24:59,760
pollination you know it's it's not you

3596
02:24:58,359 --> 02:25:02,559
didn't this guy didn't actually make the

3597
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:04,960
seeds I guess the question is in my mind

3598
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:07,318
it seems reasonable to believe that like

3599
02:25:04,959 --> 02:25:09,119
if you select the male and drop off all

3600
02:25:07,318 --> 02:25:10,439
the plants you know you sort of made the

3601
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:13,279
hybrid you just someone's just

3602
02:25:10,439 --> 02:25:14,600
facilitating that pollination to go down

3603
02:25:13,279 --> 02:25:16,200
do you think there's any difference

3604
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:17,880
there between white labeling or do you

3605
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:19,720
think that like it's more like what I

3606
02:25:17,879 --> 02:25:21,278
described where it's like the person who

3607
02:25:19,719 --> 02:25:23,000
does all the selection and comes up with

3608
02:25:21,279 --> 02:25:25,439
the plan like they're the one who's made

3609
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,840
it even if they didn't physically

3610
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:30,359
facilitate the pollen hitting the

3611
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:31,840
female yeah I mean there's there's a

3612
02:25:30,359 --> 02:25:33,760
difference I mean the selection is the

3613
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:35,920
whole art of the whole thing I mean as

3614
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:37,960
long as you keep the plants healthy and

3615
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:41,879
you know facilitate the pollen to the to

3616
02:25:37,959 --> 02:25:44,759
the female and and you know do the

3617
02:25:41,879 --> 02:25:47,039
basic the basic grow the basic flower of

3618
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:48,880
it it's the rest of the work is done the

3619
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:50,399
hardest the most difficult the most

3620
02:25:48,879 --> 02:25:52,839
challenging part is the selection of the

3621
02:25:50,398 --> 02:25:54,439
male and and the isolation of whatever

3622
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:56,520
female you're going to use and and

3623
02:25:54,439 --> 02:25:59,040
lining up that you know it's kind of

3624
02:25:56,520 --> 02:26:01,359
like drawn out a map of what you think

3625
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:03,000
is is going to happen and the other

3626
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:06,120
person's just driving the car from point

3627
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:09,879
A to point B you know

3628
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:11,439
um it's definitely some different type

3629
02:26:09,879 --> 02:26:13,039
of white labeling it's definitely kind

3630
02:26:11,439 --> 02:26:15,880
of white labeling at the same time

3631
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:17,640
though so I guess it's like one and the

3632
02:26:15,879 --> 02:26:20,358
same but different

3633
02:26:17,639 --> 02:26:23,318
H yeah I get you it's definitely a bit

3634
02:26:20,359 --> 02:26:24,840
of a a quagmire of like specifics isn't

3635
02:26:23,318 --> 02:26:26,840
it sort of you got to Wade your way

3636
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:29,478
through it yeah

3637
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:32,079
absolutely okay so I mean as a little

3638
02:26:29,478 --> 02:26:34,478
bit of a a change of pace um I would

3639
02:26:32,079 --> 02:26:36,879
love to ask you about testing and this

3640
02:26:34,478 --> 02:26:39,159
is an interesting topic because I truly

3641
02:26:36,879 --> 02:26:40,639
feel there's no wrong answer here and I

3642
02:26:39,159 --> 02:26:42,359
guess if you look at the Spectrum of

3643
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:43,959
testing you know in the past there was

3644
02:26:42,359 --> 02:26:46,279
this expectation that absolutely

3645
02:26:43,959 --> 02:26:48,278
everything came very thoroughly tested

3646
02:26:46,279 --> 02:26:49,880
but as Times Gone by I've had many

3647
02:26:48,279 --> 02:26:52,120
guests on the show who Echo this

3648
02:26:49,879 --> 02:26:53,759
sentiment that if you were to do things

3649
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:55,520
like the way we did it in the old school

3650
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:57,880
days and you you know you're doing these

3651
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:59,520
really vigorous testings on everything

3652
02:26:57,879 --> 02:27:01,039
you're sort of are not going to be able

3653
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:02,760
to keep up with the market you know by

3654
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:04,479
the time something's actually ready to

3655
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:06,040
go to market because you've done your

3656
02:27:04,478 --> 02:27:07,398
all the testing the way people want you

3657
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:09,040
know the Market's sort of moved on a

3658
02:27:07,398 --> 02:27:11,199
little bit and then you look at the

3659
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:13,240
other end of the spectrum and you've got

3660
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:16,079
guys like Masonic who I I really like

3661
02:27:13,239 --> 02:27:17,680
Masonic and um you know he says no I

3662
02:27:16,079 --> 02:27:19,239
don't test any of stuff and I'm very

3663
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:21,639
upfront about that I will tell you this

3664
02:27:19,239 --> 02:27:24,079
pack is $50 cuz it's not tested but like

3665
02:27:21,639 --> 02:27:25,879
you know it's 50 bucks like H I guess

3666
02:27:24,079 --> 02:27:27,559
I'm wondering where do you stand on that

3667
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:28,639
do you feel one side is more correct

3668
02:27:27,559 --> 02:27:30,680
than the other do you feel like it's

3669
02:27:28,639 --> 02:27:31,920
just a distribution and it's like just

3670
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:33,680
as Masonic say it's just about being

3671
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:35,799
honest it doesn't really matter where do

3672
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,000
you sit on that one yeah I don't think

3673
02:27:35,799 --> 02:27:38,679
there's a right or wrong as long as

3674
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,398
you're transparent about it I mean I

3675
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:43,359
think if you know if he like you said

3676
02:27:40,398 --> 02:27:45,318
masic whatever uh if he's telling people

3677
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:46,760
hey look these are not tested seeds buy

3678
02:27:45,318 --> 02:27:49,519
them at your own discretion they're

3679
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:52,000
their 50 bucks or whatever and people

3680
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:53,399
can wrap their head around like I'm just

3681
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,279
going to spend 50 bucks and I'm going to

3682
02:27:53,398 --> 02:27:56,680
see what comes of it then you know that

3683
02:27:55,279 --> 02:27:58,120
that cool you know there's there's

3684
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:59,639
nothing wrong with that if that's what

3685
02:27:58,120 --> 02:28:03,359
somebody the direction somebody wants to

3686
02:27:59,639 --> 02:28:05,920
do with their breeding project um I

3687
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:08,159
think that some price tags when you

3688
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:10,680
start to get more expensive certain

3689
02:28:08,159 --> 02:28:12,879
things are expected I think when you

3690
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:15,439
start getting into the multi do price

3691
02:28:12,879 --> 02:28:18,039
tags I think that lines should be worked

3692
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:19,800
I think that seeds should be somewhat

3693
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:22,040
exclusive I believe they should be

3694
02:28:19,799 --> 02:28:23,079
tested I think that you know you should

3695
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,359
know what you're getting if you're

3696
02:28:23,079 --> 02:28:28,600
spending $200 plus dollars

3697
02:28:26,359 --> 02:28:30,600
um and I think yeah if you're going to

3698
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:33,200
offer some cheap stuff

3699
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:36,079
and you know make it available to

3700
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:38,359
anybody then you know just disclose that

3701
02:28:36,079 --> 02:28:40,840
you didn't do any testing on it and

3702
02:28:38,359 --> 02:28:42,079
that's cool too you know I think if you

3703
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:44,318
I think if you try to sell seeds that

3704
02:28:42,079 --> 02:28:45,680
are crazy expensive and you don't test

3705
02:28:44,318 --> 02:28:49,278
you just kind of drop them and you don't

3706
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:52,079
tell anybody I think that's di Mo and on

3707
02:28:49,279 --> 02:28:55,040
the topic of testing you know what sort

3708
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:57,039
of a protocol if any do you have for

3709
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:59,640
figuring out if you like a strain you

3710
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:01,439
know in the past we had bod on and he

3711
02:28:59,639 --> 02:29:03,398
was like when I make a new strain I I

3712
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:05,479
just popped 10 seeds like I try to

3713
02:29:03,398 --> 02:29:07,840
emulate the average consumer experience

3714
02:29:05,478 --> 02:29:09,278
and if I don't find anything nice then I

3715
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:10,239
think maybe I shouldn't release this one

3716
02:29:09,279 --> 02:29:12,479
you know I don't want someone to have

3717
02:29:10,239 --> 02:29:14,119
that experience what's your thoughts is

3718
02:29:12,478 --> 02:29:16,000
there a certain number of seeds you like

3719
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:19,600
to go through or is it a bit more like

3720
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:21,159
what bod said what do you do so with

3721
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:23,200
some of the past lines I've made so many

3722
02:29:21,159 --> 02:29:25,478
crosses and sometimes space is

3723
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:27,720
restricted um it depends on how what I'm

3724
02:29:25,478 --> 02:29:29,438
trying to release what you know what my

3725
02:29:27,719 --> 02:29:31,519
goal is if I if I got 10 different

3726
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:33,159
genetics I'm trying to drop um then I'll

3727
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:34,520
do something like you know a 10 or a 12

3728
02:29:33,159 --> 02:29:37,200
seed or something like that something

3729
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:39,439
that you know the average consumer would

3730
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:42,880
purchase a pack and and pop a pack and

3731
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:45,040
see what comes of it um sometimes you're

3732
02:29:42,879 --> 02:29:48,519
not allowing yourself to see the full

3733
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:51,240
expression so if I can pop more I'll pop

3734
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:53,000
more but I like the I like the B

3735
02:29:51,239 --> 02:29:55,359
approach I think that's cool man I like

3736
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,520
you know you're emulating what uh what

3737
02:29:55,359 --> 02:30:00,680
the people getting the seeds are going

3738
02:29:56,520 --> 02:30:03,640
to kind of see and I think if you have

3739
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:05,639
four to six good females that you're

3740
02:30:03,639 --> 02:30:07,959
kind of looking at and there's no issues

3741
02:30:05,639 --> 02:30:10,159
with those then I think you should be

3742
02:30:07,959 --> 02:30:13,000
all right sometimes it is cool though to

3743
02:30:10,159 --> 02:30:15,559
see a bigger pool and and kind of get an

3744
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,398
idea of kind of more rare things that'll

3745
02:30:15,559 --> 02:30:19,639
pop up some people want to see that they

3746
02:30:17,398 --> 02:30:21,398
say you know what's the what's the most

3747
02:30:19,639 --> 02:30:23,239
common you know feno that you're seeing

3748
02:30:21,398 --> 02:30:24,959
or or did you see any that kind of stood

3749
02:30:23,239 --> 02:30:29,639
out and you know some people want a

3750
02:30:24,959 --> 02:30:31,919
little bit more um information but yeah

3751
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:34,959
I think his approach is cool man I like

3752
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:36,920
that yeah yeah brilliant I like that too

3753
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:41,039
so I'd love to ask you I haven't asked

3754
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:45,840
you already what style of growing do you

3755
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:47,040
utilize um so we do a lot of mix

3756
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:49,799
Spectrum

3757
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:53,240
we do we've been doing a lot of LED type

3758
02:30:49,799 --> 02:30:55,920
stuff lately um I use a lot of

3759
02:30:53,239 --> 02:30:59,600
screens

3760
02:30:55,920 --> 02:31:02,478
um I used to do everything handw watered

3761
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:04,000
um soil I switched over to

3762
02:31:02,478 --> 02:31:07,318
Cocoa

3763
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:09,120
um I use irrigation systems now because

3764
02:31:07,318 --> 02:31:11,159
I have too many plants to tend to and

3765
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:13,920
take care of to kind of hand water and

3766
02:31:11,159 --> 02:31:17,920
do everything on my own um when I'm

3767
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:19,799
doing testing I like to not pop plants

3768
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:22,200
I like to just kind of stake them and

3769
02:31:19,799 --> 02:31:25,799
and kind of see what they do naturally

3770
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:27,439
on their own um kind of see what kind of

3771
02:31:25,799 --> 02:31:32,159
natural structures come out of them and

3772
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:36,920
stuff like that um when I'm doing more

3773
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:39,680
of a grow for flower yields um I like my

3774
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:41,879
cyes to be even and I'll top them and

3775
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:43,600
kind of get a nice SC kind of thing

3776
02:31:41,879 --> 02:31:46,398
going

3777
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:48,520
yeah yeah beautiful and do you have a

3778
02:31:46,398 --> 02:31:51,840
preferred medium or preferred nutrient

3779
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:53,200
Source anything like that uh yeah like I

3780
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:55,840
I've been sticking to Cocoa lately

3781
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:56,920
because I had so many batches of of soil

3782
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:58,880
that were

3783
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:01,079
just

3784
02:31:58,879 --> 02:32:02,639
contaminated you know a lot of these

3785
02:32:01,079 --> 02:32:03,959
supply stores out here will just like

3786
02:32:02,639 --> 02:32:06,799
kind of like leave all their soil

3787
02:32:03,959 --> 02:32:08,799
sitting outside and in the summer the

3788
02:32:06,799 --> 02:32:10,438
winter months or something and just

3789
02:32:08,799 --> 02:32:12,239
you'll get gnats or you know they'll

3790
02:32:10,439 --> 02:32:15,120
come with all this stuff so I've been

3791
02:32:12,239 --> 02:32:17,799
kind of like staying with like um

3792
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:21,800
hpcc um

3793
02:32:17,799 --> 02:32:25,039
just kind of running cocoa mix you know

3794
02:32:21,799 --> 02:32:28,159
and I haven't had any issues with that

3795
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:31,600
um switched over

3796
02:32:28,159 --> 02:32:33,279
to um couple different nutrient

3797
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:35,479
companies

3798
02:32:33,279 --> 02:32:38,159
and

3799
02:32:35,478 --> 02:32:41,398
um I think once you're just dealing with

3800
02:32:38,159 --> 02:32:43,478
salts you're dealing with salts and um

3801
02:32:41,398 --> 02:32:46,278
Athena has been a product that I've been

3802
02:32:43,478 --> 02:32:49,438
utilizing over the past four or five

3803
02:32:46,279 --> 02:32:53,640
five months and yielding great results

3804
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:56,520
um we do tpine profile testing and we do

3805
02:32:53,639 --> 02:32:59,519
lab testing and and we're actually

3806
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:03,040
getting better numbers using Athena than

3807
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:06,399
um the cocoa line that we were using

3808
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:10,040
before um I use apus for a while apus

3809
02:33:06,398 --> 02:33:12,680
was good I liked apus um too many parts

3810
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:13,960
and couldn't use it in irrigation system

3811
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:16,720
so that kind

3812
02:33:13,959 --> 02:33:19,879
of forced my hand

3813
02:33:16,719 --> 02:33:22,358
um to steer away from that but when I

3814
02:33:19,879 --> 02:33:25,239
was handw watering I just did really

3815
02:33:22,359 --> 02:33:28,040
well um but yeah the the line's good

3816
02:33:25,239 --> 02:33:30,398
it's really clean great results um I

3817
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:34,240
recommend it to anybody that's uh

3818
02:33:30,398 --> 02:33:37,199
looking for ease and solid

3819
02:33:34,239 --> 02:33:40,840
results love it nice and simple always

3820
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:43,279
good to hear so I wanted to ask you

3821
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:46,200
what's your advice for anyone who's in

3822
02:33:43,279 --> 02:33:48,840
the industry who might be a little bit J

3823
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:50,159
ated with the state of things you know I

3824
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:51,760
personally feel like there's never been

3825
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:54,000
a better time to get involved in

3826
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:56,478
cannabis but I do talk to a lot of guys

3827
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,719
who were probably um pretty heavily

3828
02:33:56,478 --> 02:34:00,760
involved in the scene back in the 215

3829
02:33:58,719 --> 02:34:03,599
days you know back the sort of golden

3830
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:06,239
years when you know pounds were 4K plus

3831
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:08,200
sort of stuff uh what's your advice for

3832
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:09,520
people who feel like it's all gone wrong

3833
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:10,960
and you know they don't really see a

3834
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:13,239
pathway

3835
02:34:10,959 --> 02:34:14,879
forward um I mean if you're around back

3836
02:34:13,239 --> 02:34:18,840
when pounds were you know I've been

3837
02:34:14,879 --> 02:34:21,278
around when pounds were 60 $400 you know

3838
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:25,079
so I mean everything

3839
02:34:21,279 --> 02:34:27,520
changes um supply and demand higher

3840
02:34:25,079 --> 02:34:30,879
Supply demand probably hasn't gone down

3841
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:33,159
if anything it's it's gone up but uh I

3842
02:34:30,879 --> 02:34:35,278
mean to to compare when you know you had

3843
02:34:33,159 --> 02:34:37,439
to actually go out and look for weed

3844
02:34:35,279 --> 02:34:40,720
compared to um driving down the street

3845
02:34:37,439 --> 02:34:42,760
and just buying it of course prices are

3846
02:34:40,719 --> 02:34:46,119
going to [ __ ] come down and fluctuate

3847
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:48,079
but if your passion's in cannabis and

3848
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:51,319
you believe that you can produce a good

3849
02:34:48,079 --> 02:34:53,799
product and unique product then I don't

3850
02:34:51,318 --> 02:34:55,680
see why anything should be dictated

3851
02:34:53,799 --> 02:34:58,478
otherwise then you just get involved and

3852
02:34:55,680 --> 02:35:00,600
just kind of like you know master your

3853
02:34:58,478 --> 02:35:03,398
craft and do the best you can um the

3854
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:05,840
people always appreciate quality

3855
02:35:03,398 --> 02:35:07,358
regardless doesn't matter how much

3856
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:08,680
demand or how much Supply there is

3857
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:11,079
they're always going to seek the best

3858
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:14,680
flow the unique flow or something else

3859
02:35:11,079 --> 02:35:16,799
that people don't have so I wouldn't let

3860
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:18,279
the current state of the market

3861
02:35:16,799 --> 02:35:21,039
dictate whether you are going to be

3862
02:35:18,279 --> 02:35:22,840
involved in it or not it's you know let

3863
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:25,600
the passion kind of steer you in the

3864
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:28,520
right direction and figure out your path

3865
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:32,159
and Blaze your own

3866
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:34,640
trail yeah I like that that's awesome

3867
02:35:32,159 --> 02:35:36,879
we've got a few fan submitted questions

3868
02:35:34,639 --> 02:35:38,439
before we get to the the final five

3869
02:35:36,879 --> 02:35:40,559
quickfile ones and the first one I

3870
02:35:38,439 --> 02:35:42,479
wanted to ask you is can you tell us a

3871
02:35:40,559 --> 02:35:47,049
little bit about the

3872
02:35:42,478 --> 02:35:49,119
Hashburg sure uh great yielder

3873
02:35:47,049 --> 02:35:52,318
[Music]

3874
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:57,680
um very Burger

3875
02:35:52,318 --> 02:36:01,278
es the GMO definitely dominated in that

3876
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:04,000
um you have to like hashy

3877
02:36:01,279 --> 02:36:07,159
strains

3878
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:09,478
and basically you have to be okay with

3879
02:36:07,159 --> 02:36:13,079
the GMO profile it's just it was so

3880
02:36:09,478 --> 02:36:13,079
dominant in that cross it was

3881
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:18,800
just it was basically like running a

3882
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:20,879
triple burger or a double burger it was

3883
02:36:18,799 --> 02:36:24,398
just it was just straight GMO most of

3884
02:36:20,879 --> 02:36:27,679
the time um so if that's your bag te

3885
02:36:24,398 --> 02:36:29,879
then yeah it's it's definitely for you

3886
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:32,040
yeah perfect perfect and what strain

3887
02:36:29,879 --> 02:36:34,239
would you recommend for any listeners

3888
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:36,240
who want to run some of your genetics

3889
02:36:34,239 --> 02:36:37,920
but they're thinking look I do produce

3890
02:36:36,239 --> 02:36:39,318
flour commercially you know not

3891
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:41,719
necessarily in a facility but like you

3892
02:36:39,318 --> 02:36:43,920
know I I make my income from this so

3893
02:36:41,719 --> 02:36:45,119
strain does need to lend itself a bit to

3894
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:47,840
that you know maybe a little better

3895
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:50,520
yielding some good turfs maybe easier to

3896
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:52,239
grow anything jumped to mind from your

3897
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:53,880
range that might fit the bill for

3898
02:36:52,239 --> 02:36:54,920
someone who's Keen to run your stuff but

3899
02:36:53,879 --> 02:36:57,839
it just needs to be a little more

3900
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:59,840
commercially viable yeah I mean it's the

3901
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:03,279
cool thing about most almost every skunk

3902
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:04,799
house strain is is it does yield and it

3903
02:37:03,279 --> 02:37:08,279
does have bag appeal and it does have

3904
02:37:04,799 --> 02:37:12,000
nose so any of the genetic lines that

3905
02:37:08,279 --> 02:37:15,040
I've developed um has a pheno in there

3906
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:17,000
that is for a commercial grower or any

3907
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:19,120
circumstance that you know somebody's

3908
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:22,840
going to select you know any feno from

3909
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:25,760
any pack um there's hash shielders

3910
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:27,600
there's there's you know flower yielders

3911
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:29,760
there's everything because it's it's

3912
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:32,000
most of it has GMO spliced in it and it

3913
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:36,439
just it'll just yield like a beast you

3914
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:39,680
know so um the burger lines especially

3915
02:37:36,439 --> 02:37:42,120
so stick to those um the OG lines yield

3916
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:45,520
very well but they don't yield as much

3917
02:37:42,120 --> 02:37:48,399
as the GMO lines the burger lines so I

3918
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:49,520
would definitely say sticking to some of

3919
02:37:48,398 --> 02:37:51,879
the Donnie

3920
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:54,680
crosses um even the modified banana

3921
02:37:51,879 --> 02:37:56,959
crosses yield super well and can you

3922
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:58,559
know completely be viable in commercial

3923
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:01,879
settings

3924
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:04,079
um yeah I mean there's really not a bad

3925
02:38:01,879 --> 02:38:06,119
option I guess it just depends on what

3926
02:38:04,079 --> 02:38:07,760
kind of T profile you're looking for and

3927
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:09,319
and there's something available in

3928
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:11,680
almost every

3929
02:38:09,318 --> 02:38:14,559
other yeah that's beautiful to hear that

3930
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:16,279
there's so many options and another fan

3931
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:18,920
submitted question we got is

3932
02:38:16,279 --> 02:38:21,680
do we ever have any chance of seeing

3933
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:25,879
maybe any s1's of your

3934
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:28,600
Keepers absolutely um I want to do a

3935
02:38:25,879 --> 02:38:30,559
whole S1 line I just I've had a couple

3936
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:33,279
projects that have just kind of Taken

3937
02:38:30,559 --> 02:38:36,199
front seat to it so um that's kind of

3938
02:38:33,279 --> 02:38:38,960
gotten bumped back I've done a bunch of

3939
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:41,680
small S1 work just to see what is and

3940
02:38:38,959 --> 02:38:44,000
what isn't viable and I've gotten great

3941
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:46,239
you know results they've yielded amazing

3942
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,959
plants so there is going to be a bunch

3943
02:38:46,239 --> 02:38:50,680
of S1 stuff there's also going to be

3944
02:38:47,959 --> 02:38:52,239
clone drops uh breeder cut clone drops

3945
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:55,159
that are going to be available here in

3946
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:58,159
Michigan um for people that maybe don't

3947
02:38:55,159 --> 02:39:01,959
even want to um pop seed and they just

3948
02:38:58,159 --> 02:39:03,760
want um keeper genetics off the bat um

3949
02:39:01,959 --> 02:39:06,199
yeah I mean I I got a bunch of stuff in

3950
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:09,239
the works I'm just trying to make you

3951
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:11,079
know things possible for anybody in any

3952
02:39:09,239 --> 02:39:14,359
circumstance beautiful there's something

3953
02:39:11,079 --> 02:39:17,719
for everyone I like that I like that so

3954
02:39:14,359 --> 02:39:19,120
what are the plans for skunk house or

3955
02:39:17,719 --> 02:39:21,239
you know skunk Master Flex more

3956
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:23,000
generally in the future have you got any

3957
02:39:21,239 --> 02:39:24,398
projects you're Keen to start or any

3958
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:26,279
long-term

3959
02:39:24,398 --> 02:39:30,239
Visions yeah I mean right now we're

3960
02:39:26,279 --> 02:39:33,159
doing the uh Josh D collab one really

3961
02:39:30,239 --> 02:39:35,920
really really psyched on that um just as

3962
02:39:33,159 --> 02:39:38,318
a OG lover it's my favorite it's it's

3963
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:40,920
the end lbl for me and to work with

3964
02:39:38,318 --> 02:39:43,680
somebody like Josh that's such an OG vet

3965
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:45,719
you know helped kind of like just

3966
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:47,398
catapult the OG and and bring it to to

3967
02:39:45,719 --> 02:39:50,478
the masses it's

3968
02:39:47,398 --> 02:39:53,599
just it's a it's a it's a dream collab

3969
02:39:50,478 --> 02:39:55,438
for me you know he's he's a great guy

3970
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:57,318
really looking forward to that one um

3971
02:39:55,439 --> 02:40:00,318
there's a few other people that I'm in

3972
02:39:57,318 --> 02:40:02,239
the works of of negotiating collab work

3973
02:40:00,318 --> 02:40:06,199
with that I'm really really excited

3974
02:40:02,239 --> 02:40:08,680
about um if they go through um always

3975
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:12,960
going to keep running and working on the

3976
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:16,000
Larry line that's just a a a fan

3977
02:40:12,959 --> 02:40:17,959
favorite um the burger line are not

3978
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:19,680
going anywhere there's always room to

3979
02:40:17,959 --> 02:40:21,559
expand on those and and bring in

3980
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:24,800
different genetics to kind of outcross

3981
02:40:21,559 --> 02:40:27,439
and and work and see what comes of that

3982
02:40:24,799 --> 02:40:29,959
so lots lots in the works for skunk

3983
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:31,600
house over the next couple of years not

3984
02:40:29,959 --> 02:40:36,438
planning on going anywhere

3985
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:38,520
and G to keep things still with the same

3986
02:40:36,439 --> 02:40:41,200
idea concept I've always had which is

3987
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:42,760
like only make across once the people

3988
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:44,840
that actually get it like let them have

3989
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:47,200
something that's really unique and let

3990
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:50,960
them do their selections and kind of let

3991
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:52,200
them have that you know um exclusivity

3992
02:40:50,959 --> 02:40:55,079
is very

3993
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:58,880
important yeah I like that I like that a

3994
02:40:55,079 --> 02:41:02,760
lot so a question we love to ask all our

3995
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:04,839
guests what are the rarest seeds in your

3996
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:08,159
Vault or the seeds that you're most

3997
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:12,639
excited to pop I do have

3998
02:41:08,159 --> 02:41:15,200
some original chmd GSC where the GMO

3999
02:41:12,639 --> 02:41:18,680
came from seeds laps um a small little

4000
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:21,560
pile of them those are everybody's like

4001
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:23,800
pop those pop those

4002
02:41:21,559 --> 02:41:26,359
um man I got some Northern Lights

4003
02:41:23,799 --> 02:41:30,318
crosses that I got from a a guy that

4004
02:41:26,359 --> 02:41:32,720
made some uh out of New York um Northern

4005
02:41:30,318 --> 02:41:36,119
Lights seven cross with like this I

4006
02:41:32,719 --> 02:41:38,159
Northern Light that he did um talking

4007
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:40,880
about what we did earlier with the whole

4008
02:41:38,159 --> 02:41:42,279
bringing back old school stuff um those

4009
02:41:40,879 --> 02:41:43,478
have been kind of like burning a hole in

4010
02:41:42,279 --> 02:41:47,159
my

4011
02:41:43,478 --> 02:41:49,000
fridge um I have have some I have some

4012
02:41:47,159 --> 02:41:51,000
some AK seeds I don't know if they're

4013
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:53,559
even viable anymore but original

4014
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:57,079
packaging AK seeds from like 97 or

4015
02:41:53,559 --> 02:42:01,079
something um been just dying to pop

4016
02:41:57,079 --> 02:42:03,000
those um a bunch of older stuff man

4017
02:42:01,079 --> 02:42:06,079
that's just been sitting there that I'm

4018
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:07,200
like I I like I'm afraid to pop it

4019
02:42:06,079 --> 02:42:08,879
because if they don't pop I'm just going

4020
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:10,200
to be so devastated so I've just like

4021
02:42:08,879 --> 02:42:14,559
kept putting them off which is like the

4022
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:16,800
dumbest thing I can do but yeah it's uh

4023
02:42:14,559 --> 02:42:19,359
the seed vault is just so extensive man

4024
02:42:16,799 --> 02:42:21,318
it's just I got to find time and

4025
02:42:19,359 --> 02:42:23,399
dedicate space to it

4026
02:42:21,318 --> 02:42:25,199
and it's just one of those things you

4027
02:42:23,398 --> 02:42:27,879
don't want to mess up because they're so

4028
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:30,840
old and or you're not going to get them

4029
02:42:27,879 --> 02:42:34,679
again yeah totally totally I can relate

4030
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:38,079
to that concerned with the seeds Okay so

4031
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:40,120
on to our final five questions uh the

4032
02:42:38,079 --> 02:42:42,120
first one it's a a new one that we've

4033
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:44,560
been doing recently if you had to

4034
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:46,880
restart your seed company with just one

4035
02:42:44,559 --> 02:42:48,639
packet of your seed seeds presumably to

4036
02:42:46,879 --> 02:42:50,879
find a male but you know you might also

4037
02:42:48,639 --> 02:42:52,680
pick a a f pack and find a female and

4038
02:42:50,879 --> 02:42:53,920
want to go from there what pack would

4039
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:56,880
you

4040
02:42:53,920 --> 02:43:00,680
pick uh this is seeds that I've released

4041
02:42:56,879 --> 02:43:03,799
or in my collection uh seeds that you've

4042
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:05,159
made okay so I've never released them

4043
02:43:03,799 --> 02:43:09,039
but yeah I would probably just use the

4044
02:43:05,159 --> 02:43:11,439
Straight Larry uh backat Cross f8 or F9

4045
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:14,640
or F10 and and start a line from that

4046
02:43:11,439 --> 02:43:17,200
it's you can pick them up and put 20 30

4047
02:43:14,639 --> 02:43:19,559
of them into water and just find gold

4048
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:22,399
and work a whole line with it and it's

4049
02:43:19,559 --> 02:43:23,439
easy peasy like it's no no difficulty at

4050
02:43:22,398 --> 02:43:26,799
all in

4051
02:43:23,439 --> 02:43:29,520
it perfect perfect I love that so next

4052
02:43:26,799 --> 02:43:33,039
one is what's the single most memorable

4053
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:36,439
or impactful experience you've had with

4054
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:36,439
cannabis uh getting

4055
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:45,920
arrested easily uh hands down um yeah uh

4056
02:43:43,559 --> 02:43:48,559
just realizing how fast like for

4057
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:51,478
something that you love so much how it

4058
02:43:48,559 --> 02:43:55,639
can just mess your whole life up and how

4059
02:43:51,478 --> 02:43:58,519
stupid it is that it's that illegal and

4060
02:43:55,639 --> 02:44:00,278
um just it makes me realize all the

4061
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:02,600
people that were before us and kind of

4062
02:44:00,279 --> 02:44:05,520
paved the way and it just it it really

4063
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:08,040
levels me out and grounds me that um

4064
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:09,640
people did so much for legalization and

4065
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:12,279
and allowed us to be in the state that

4066
02:44:09,639 --> 02:44:15,239
we're in right now it's just that that

4067
02:44:12,279 --> 02:44:17,760
one act of just going through years

4068
02:44:15,239 --> 02:44:20,439
years of of Courts and all that stuff

4069
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:21,318
just for just for something stupid like

4070
02:44:20,439 --> 02:44:24,200
having

4071
02:44:21,318 --> 02:44:26,199
flowers it's outrageous man but yeah

4072
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:28,720
it's uh that's probably the most

4073
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:31,000
impactful thing with cannabis that uh

4074
02:44:28,719 --> 02:44:32,799
that I've had to go through it's good

4075
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:36,279
answer I don't think anyone can deny

4076
02:44:32,799 --> 02:44:38,438
that so uh next question would be what's

4077
02:44:36,279 --> 02:44:40,720
a strain that everyone around you was

4078
02:44:38,439 --> 02:44:42,398
hyping up you were really excited to try

4079
02:44:40,719 --> 02:44:44,159
it and then finally did and you were

4080
02:44:42,398 --> 02:44:46,799
like oh is that

4081
02:44:44,159 --> 02:44:49,159
it

4082
02:44:46,799 --> 02:44:52,000
um I would

4083
02:44:49,159 --> 02:44:53,879
say is this over like the whole duration

4084
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,760
of just working with cannabis or just

4085
02:44:53,879 --> 02:44:58,799
recently yeah

4086
02:44:55,760 --> 02:45:00,920
ever okay

4087
02:44:58,799 --> 02:45:02,278
um that's a tough one because there's

4088
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:05,279
been some really hyped up stuff that

4089
02:45:02,279 --> 02:45:10,800
I've really gotten a hold of and really

4090
02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:10,800
didn't H that is a tough question my

4091
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:16,000
man um like from like things from like

4092
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:17,399
just you know like

4093
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:21,159
not to pick on purple punch because I

4094
02:45:17,398 --> 02:45:22,879
actually enjoy purple punch but like um

4095
02:45:21,159 --> 02:45:24,639
people were talking about how like

4096
02:45:22,879 --> 02:45:26,599
amazing it was and then you smoke it

4097
02:45:24,639 --> 02:45:28,760
you're like I I get it for flavor but it

4098
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:30,760
just it doesn't have some kind of

4099
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:33,439
wrecking devastating high and especially

4100
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:34,960
coming off the era of like OG kushes and

4101
02:45:33,439 --> 02:45:37,840
chems where like you know these things

4102
02:45:34,959 --> 02:45:41,000
hit you're expecting this fruity

4103
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:45,760
tropical bomb of just pure insane high

4104
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:47,600
and not really quite getting there um

4105
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:49,200
a lot of the gelato I've been kind of

4106
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:50,479
disappointed with I didn't really think

4107
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:53,079
they were that

4108
02:45:50,478 --> 02:45:55,199
great

4109
02:45:53,079 --> 02:45:57,079
um yeah it's hard to it's hard to

4110
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:58,560
pinpoint one genetic I'm like kind of

4111
02:45:57,079 --> 02:46:01,039
dumbfounded right now I can't think of

4112
02:45:58,559 --> 02:46:03,559
one that I'm just been completely like

4113
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:04,090
just in awe of how people even enjoy it

4114
02:46:03,559 --> 02:46:05,439
but

4115
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:08,000
[Music]

4116
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:10,040
um yeah one of these freaking designer

4117
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:12,398
ones that have came out recently and

4118
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:15,279
just I don't know there's a lot of like

4119
02:46:12,398 --> 02:46:18,159
boring turp I'd say any of the boring

4120
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:19,920
Turf ones that just don't really do it

4121
02:46:18,159 --> 02:46:21,799
for you on the high or anything it's

4122
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:23,840
just uh you know you expect more from

4123
02:46:21,799 --> 02:46:25,519
the people these days with all these

4124
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:28,639
options they

4125
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:30,399
have there you go there you go so next

4126
02:46:28,639 --> 02:46:32,799
one we have is we're going to drop you

4127
02:46:30,398 --> 02:46:35,639
off on a desert island presumably you

4128
02:46:32,799 --> 02:46:37,478
can grow three strains for the rest of

4129
02:46:35,639 --> 02:46:41,719
time what three are you going to take

4130
02:46:37,478 --> 02:46:45,318
with you uh OG Kush number one not any

4131
02:46:41,719 --> 02:46:48,840
specific one I'd say just an OG Kush the

4132
02:46:45,318 --> 02:46:51,719
original the Larry any of them any of

4133
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:55,559
that category would work for me um a

4134
02:46:51,719 --> 02:46:57,318
chem either the chem4 or the chmd um and

4135
02:46:55,559 --> 02:47:01,359
possibly a Bubba Kush man probably the

4136
02:46:57,318 --> 02:47:03,318
original one um those are just like if I

4137
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:05,040
could just as long as I have jars of

4138
02:47:03,318 --> 02:47:07,879
those in

4139
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:10,399
like one of the three of those will

4140
02:47:07,879 --> 02:47:13,239
always do it for me um they're desert

4141
02:47:10,398 --> 02:47:15,478
island strain for sure um there's a

4142
02:47:13,239 --> 02:47:18,279
couple close competitors it's like maybe

4143
02:47:15,478 --> 02:47:19,679
the URL sometimes the Urkel can the 's

4144
02:47:18,279 --> 02:47:21,399
weird man it's like sometimes it can

4145
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:23,920
almost be too

4146
02:47:21,398 --> 02:47:25,879
much like the realle is like

4147
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:28,398
devastatingly crushingly high like it's

4148
02:47:25,879 --> 02:47:30,079
just it's strong and I don't know if I

4149
02:47:28,398 --> 02:47:33,719
want to go to bed all the time maybe

4150
02:47:30,079 --> 02:47:35,200
that one but um I could eliminate it

4151
02:47:33,719 --> 02:47:37,318
down to the number one in it just being

4152
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:40,200
OG Kush that would be my my desert

4153
02:47:37,318 --> 02:47:44,278
island strain single desert island

4154
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:46,479
stream yeah good pick good pick so we're

4155
02:47:44,279 --> 02:47:47,960
going to turn the tables now uh you're

4156
02:47:46,478 --> 02:47:49,159
going to drop someone else off on the

4157
02:47:47,959 --> 02:47:51,478
desert island someone you're not

4158
02:47:49,159 --> 02:47:54,398
particularly fond of what three strains

4159
02:47:51,478 --> 02:47:58,199
you going to leave them oh man uh Temple

4160
02:47:54,398 --> 02:48:01,760
Hayes from from bod so they just [ __ ]

4161
02:47:58,200 --> 02:48:01,760

4183
02:48:55,279 --> 02:49:00,840
to like I'm gonna go to like Amsterdam

4184
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:05,439

4185
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:08,880
the mid to later 90s and I'm going to

4186
02:49:05,439 --> 02:49:10,800
get like some old Sensi stock and it's

4187
02:49:08,879 --> 02:49:14,358
going to

4188
02:49:10,799 --> 02:49:15,840
be [ __ ] I don't even know I don't even

4189
02:49:14,359 --> 02:49:18,200
know what would be maybe some of their

4190
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:19,680
earlier skunk work some of it I feel

4191
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:21,439
like some of some of that stuff has just

4192
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:25,600
been used whether it's been admitted or

4193
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:27,159
not in so many crosses and so much of

4194
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:30,479
the foundation of what we know is

4195
02:49:27,159 --> 02:49:32,639
cannabis now that it's like ridiculous

4196
02:49:30,478 --> 02:49:34,959
you know it was just such stabilized

4197
02:49:32,639 --> 02:49:37,238
work and just maybe if it wasn't the

4198
02:49:34,959 --> 02:49:40,478
most de devastating high it was

4199
02:49:37,238 --> 02:49:42,879
just it was such an important part for

4200
02:49:40,478 --> 02:49:46,519
cannabis genetically that it would

4201
02:49:42,879 --> 02:49:47,920
probably be something like that era

4202
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:50,960
yeah that's a that's a good pick there
