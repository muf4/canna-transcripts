facility in Colorado although this show

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,200
is a podcast this episode was actually

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,558
going to be a video episode However

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,640
unfortunately due to a technology

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,280
gramlin the video didn't save properly

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,399
and we only have the audio however this

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,000
doesn't affect the interview at all also

21
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,960
I just quickly wanted to apologize to Mr

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,558
Sol and Duke the first 20 seconds of the

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
interview was cut out and this was when

24
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,079
they were both introducing themselves so

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,558
again my apologies but we're just going

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,920
to jump right into the interview just

27
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:56,358
after they've introduce themselves as

28
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,760
we've walked into the first mother room

29
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,039
of the

30
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:05,519
tour you're looking at the uh this is a

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,400
sour diesel uh skunk hybrid here um you

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,640
know the original Sour Diesel was a a

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,478
skunk that came out of Virginia and it

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,200
got crossed with the Kim dog and that

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,319
made your Sour Diesel so what I did was

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,400
I took the same genetic the the my skunk

37
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,399
is from the same family and we crossed

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,000
it to the sour diesel to bring out more

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,159
of the skunky side of things there so

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,719
you know we have a couple of those right

41
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,439
here um we have

42
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:37,519
yeah man and then over here we have the

43
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:40,199
same skunk maale to the Kim dog so

44
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,000
essentially we've made a sour diesel

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,520
using uh just using a regular mail

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,799
instead of like a hermaphrodite accident

47
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,118
you know so having these two yeah we'll

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,960
grow them out you know we'll look at

49
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,840
little different traits you know like

50
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,839
little leaf traits like how thin thick V

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,840
uh variegation or the serrations and

52
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,719
branching pattern and things like that

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,399
and then we can take these things and

54
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,399
kind of assess them and we could

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,318
actually use this like maybe a male from

56
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,000
this to the female sour diesel clone and

57
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,799
maybe outcross back to the sour diesel

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,159
skunk depending on what traits we're

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,319
looking for whether it be yield or

60
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:25,719
something cool like that uh so you're

61
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,958
almost doing a s diesel IBL in a way

62
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,759
yeah exactly like we'll put it into a

63
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,120
seed form to where like you you know

64
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,799
everybody chases down that clone and

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
with that clone they they kind of screw

66
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,400
up you know because there's a lot of

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,680
fake ones you know and everybody over

68
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,560
here wants to be a special Little

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,879
Snowflake and they're like oh yeah we

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,840
got it we got it they ain't got [ __ ] man

71
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,199
they ain't got nothing they got some Bag

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,640
seed from something that ain't even sour

73
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,878
right so it's pretty cool that if people

74
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,639
could actually like grow that in seed

75
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,759
for and be able to experience that too

76
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,279
and be able to like sprout seeds and

77
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:04,158
actually have them come up sour and

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,878
Diesel and you know have something good

79
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,919
and just for everyone listening um

80
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,158
you're referring to AJ's Sour Diesel is

81
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,878
the

82
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:14,798
original yeah like he didn't breed it or

83
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,959
anything but the guys up around Albany

84
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,719
and up in New York City those are the

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,280
guys who created her um a friend of mine

86
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,080
on Instagram he goes by Skunk VA he uh

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,080
he's the guy who traded him the skunk

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,879
for the Kim dog back in 94 and um those

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,840
are that's the crew that made the sour

90
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:37,919
diesel it was an accident really but you

91
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,799
know it got made a that's so interesting

92
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,000
cuz I was wondering how did uh how did

93
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:47,280
you tie into the whole chem family well

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,199
back in uh let's see I think it was uh

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,598
2004 um I met uh guy Kim dog everybody

96
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,919
called him back in it was mass G for

97
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,919
Massachusetts and G was his uh initial

98
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,878
of his first name that just kind of

99
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,318
bumped into him I was going and hitting

100
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,359
up like music festivals and things like

101
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,158
that and

102
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,560

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,840
was like absolutely I tooken up some

128
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,360
clones of skunk and white widow and

129
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:26,279
bunch of bunch of different stuff G13

130

uh gives me a whole bunch of stuff like

132
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,400
super snow dog and whole bunch of cool

133
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,318
stuff and then uh like over here this is

134
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:40,758
the original this is the what they call

135
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:43,720
the 91 uh it also goes by the skunk VA

136
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,000
um my buddy he's uh he's the guy kind of

137
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,759
held her safe for you know what 20s

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,800
something years so but that's her she uh

139
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,439
she's a little more viny you know a

140
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,199
little more lanky and everything but uh

141
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,360
man most killer killer weed on Earth

142
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,240
though I mean it's is so so strong and

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,840
then like hell everybody's always like

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,800
God it's so much like OG and stuff so

145
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,038
here this is the uh triangle cush here

146
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,960
which is actually like the mother of all

147
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:17,399
what they call OG strains you know a I

148
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,839
see and she's from Florida

149
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,359
1992 but yeah you can kind of get a look

150
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,159
of that structure and like how you know

151
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,120
she's very noty you know and then like

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,560
you can look at the Ken dog and you can

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,560
kind of see some of those of those same

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,918
traits so yeah yeah see I hear a lot

155
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,759
about the uh the history of ogs and you

156
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,719
hear about things like the crippy and uh

157
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,080
obviously triangle Kush quite a bit you

158
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
you think it's pretty definitively

159
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,439
triangle

160
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:51,120
Kush oh yeah um so like uh you you heard

161
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,399
of uh cornbread rookie before right yeah

162
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
he's pretty big on

163
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,359
Instagram yeah yeah so he's got Swamp

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,079
Boy seeds and stuff so he's the guy who

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,960
gave that triangle its name

166
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,878
uh I don't know if y'all know about like

167
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:08,318
the mysterious things of the world they

168
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,520
have the uh Bermuda Triangle you know

169
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,080
where ailia air heart was flying and got

170
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:16,000
lost in it and all that so the way I got

171
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,478
that name was you know stuff would [ __ ]

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,319
you up so bad

173
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,240
man you yeah you get lost where the hell

174
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,720
you're going so they ended up calling it

175
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,639
The Triangle and like they're from

176
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,360
Florida too so uh you know that name

177
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,000
kind of stuck but me and him have talked

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,038
and and you know these these plants uh I

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,319
can't really get into it too much but

180
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,759
these plants they're they're very very

181
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,039
very closely related yeah so it all

182
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,400
boils down

183
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,878
to couple of people that were doing some

184
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:49,079
things kind of running in the same

185
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,360
circles but just uh you know that type

186
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,719
of deal old illegal

187
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,158
world yeah so just stay on that same

188
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,639
point um a lot of your plants they look

189
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,158
so fantastic it's unbelievable how old

190
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,280
some of them are what's your opinions on

191
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,839
how to um keep your clones nice and

192
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,239
vigorous you know not letting them go to

193
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:10,758
crap over

194
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:14,960
time well I would say the the number one

195
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,800
thing to do um so I tell you what man

196
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,519
I'm gonna take y'all on a tour to the

197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,840
mom area here where we keep our old

198
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,038
mother plants and all these good

199
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:30,318
things awesome probably a little bit

200
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:33,360
quieter too eh yeah know it's

201
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
so like right here this is a master cush

202
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,599
from

203
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,559
1996 oh

204
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:47,080
wow nice big broad

205
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:50,479
Le oh yeah man so like the key I would

206
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,160
say is you know you keep a plant healthy

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,839
now when my cousins gave me this back in

208
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:59,439
the day you know we kept things pretty

209
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,360
pretty healthy now I got busted DEA back

210
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,399
back in 2007 and I had some friends you

211
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,919
know keep cuting here and there and my

212
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,720
one friend we used to call him the

213
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:14,319
butcher because like he'd keep a gray

214
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,240
room 110 degrees he'd have spider mites

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,839
he wouldn't feed them right you know

216
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,560
plant look like utter dog [ __ ] so you

217
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,360
know you get a cutting back from them

218
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,958
and I mean just looks terrible you don't

219
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,639
even think this thing's going to live

220
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,159
but if you take the cutting and um I

221
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,240
I'll throw you a little trick so if you

222
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,679
got something really really sick um a

223
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,159
plant cannabis plant they they put off a

224
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,958
it's called Sal aiic acid that's part of

225
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,039
their their immune system so um like to

226
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,919
us like be like me and you getting like

227
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,278
some antibiotics to help us beat an

228
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,240
infection or something so what you do is

229
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:50,360
you get a aloe vera powder or aloe vera

230
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,519
water okay now that's very high dose of

231
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,519
Sal atic acid you can water it with that

232
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,000
and there's something else called neem

233
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,919
cake that uh is really rich in it's

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,360
called Aida

235
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,559
uh all these things help to support the

236
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,440
immune system so if you give it that and

237
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:10,078
then you're also uh you know like me I'm

238
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,920
a soil guy everything's all organic soil

239
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,479
so if you got a good microbial life in

240
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,879
your dirt here and uh you you got what

241
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,278
it needs to to eat and Thrive and you

242
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:24,278
got a good light source on it um you can

243
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,278
make that clone look great so if I told

244
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,399
you that you know before you're seeing

245
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,439
this that when I got this clone it

246
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,679
looked like something barely alive well

247
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
you treat it good you grow out a big

248
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,199
nice mom like this and then you start

249
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,199
taking good healthy cuting and once you

250
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,879
keep that good healthy cutting long as

251
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,040
you keep it healthy man you know they're

252
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,799
good for for years and years and years

253
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,120
now you'll have to excuse me like some

254
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,199
of these like this one we just got

255
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,519
through taking a whole bunch of clones

256
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,959
man for new breeding program but uh

257
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:03,240
beautiful don't worry thank you man but

258
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:06,439
this one here this is from 1984 this is

259
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,440
Durban poisonin yeah but still just as

260
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,800
bigger as this can beig kicking ass over

261
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,800
here we have the Airborne

262
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,120
G13 I forgot the exact year but I think

263
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,519
it's somewhere around like 86 or 88

264
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,399
something along them lines but yeah man

265
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,039
keep them healthy and then over here we

266
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,278
got the 88 G13 hash plant it's been

267
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:33,719
hacked on a little bit for cuttings and

268
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:36,039
all but the one and nice yeah man the

269
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,920
one and only man the

270
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,159
thriller so um just kind of looping back

271
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,679
to the uh that other point you made um

272
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,879
especially in terms of talking about

273
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,078
kind of the biochemistry behind it I

274
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,600
love uh the KB cycle post you had on

275
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:52,159
your Instagram um and I personally know

276
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,360
that uh you're an engineer but I was

277
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,600
wondering did you do any uh like biology

278
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,240
or biochemistry courses at all CU you

279
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,920
seem to have a fairly good grasp of that

280
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,240
as well

281
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,919
yeah they um so the the school I went to

282
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,680
basically they're like you know y'all

283
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,278
are a bunch of country pumpkins and like

284
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,638
you guys you know you better learn how

285
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,600
to work on a car or wire something up or

286
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,159
weld something or you know you kids are

287
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,519
going to be screwed but they also so

288
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,399
where I'm from is big uh big

289
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:25,240
agricultural area so we grew a lot of

290
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,159
tobacco um soybeans Tomatoes you know

291
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,039
about anything you can think of and we

292
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:33,480
grow a little weed back in the woods you

293
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:35,240
know a little supplemental income but um

294
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,600
we we we did have like some pretty

295
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,159
decent little classes in high school now

296
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,240
they weren't like very Advanced but it

297
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,399
was enough to really get my interest

298
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,120
peaked and basically man we cheap

299
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,600
library card I'd do all the researching

300
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,399
I could and anything I could learn man

301
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,480
I'd try to pick it up and then I would

302
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,519
apply it and I'd say okay that's good or

303
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,560
it's bad and I just kept the good things

304
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,120
and left the bad [ __ ] behind and um yeah

305
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,638
it's uh definitely helps if you you know

306
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,560
you get into a little bit of the biology

307
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,039
and that gives you a pretty good

308
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,559
fundamental on you know how plants work

309
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,639
and photosynthesis and chloroplast and

310
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,198
chlorophyll and all these different

311
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,759
things but if you can understand why

312
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:27,479
something does what it does when it does

313
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,198
it and how you can help facilitate that

314
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,000
that's all the base knowledge you need

315
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:34,319
need and then like when you start

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,958
finding out like oh okay so these plants

317
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,920
when they're stressed out or pissed off

318
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,879
well they they want to start producing

319
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:45,000
Sal atic acid to help their responses so

320
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,159
like think about what's this plant's

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,399
response right like why does it produce

322
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,319
resin well it's horny man it wants

323
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,000
pollen it wants to catch pollen and get

324
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
pregnant also man that it's [ __ ]

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,519
bright in here man they want to produce

326
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,838
sunscreen as well and also like like you

327
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,639
know hell man like right

328
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,440
now so I just plucked that leaf off

329
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,278
right here right so I pluck that leaf

330
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,320
off it doesn't know I plucked that leaf

331
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:14,639
off it thinks something's eating it so

332
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,759
right now it's sitting there saying oh

333
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,399
[ __ ] something's eating me what should I

334
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,720
do so all of its responses are you know

335
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:25,600
putting off resin for sunscreen to get

336
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,399
pregnant or maybe to produce more toxins

337
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,759
or in our case drugs like THC so when

338
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,159
this little rat eats this little leaf

339
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,560
he's going to think twice about it

340
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:38,759
because he's all [ __ ] up now shaking

341
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:42,000
and [ __ ] so you just kind of learn how

342
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:44,480
to stimulate responses and then

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,320
facilitate those responses the best that

344
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,920
you can um whether it's Alo water salic

345
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,278
acid you know or coconut water with

346
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,120
enzymes and cycin to help it produce

347
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,639
more you know plant material uh in our

348
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,000
case flowers

349
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,198
um you know and you're just trying to

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,879
you know give it everything it needs as

351
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:09,838
well as kind of teas isn't it like the

352
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,039
horse and the carrot you know you dangle

353
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,040
it in front of the horse and it get gets

354
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,599
you going yeah so more or less man so I

355
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,120
guess this kind of brings us into this

356
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,639
kind of domain of you know how much of

357
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,759
breeding and high quality production is

358
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,278
science versus say an art you know

359
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,318
there's always this debate of science

360
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,039
versus art and you know I frequently

361
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:34,240
hear of people like your friend JJ myc

362
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,399
of top dog and people talk about how he

363
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,079
has this Knack this hunch for picking

364
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,679
males you know do you think at the end

365
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,039
of the day a good breeder is just mostly

366
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,359
going on a scientific approach or

367
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,360
there's a little something extra

368
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:54,759
involved so the eye that people speak of

369
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:59,160
you know like when me and soul walk into

370
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:01,600
a room and we're looking at plants

371
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:05,078
what's striking our

372
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,360
eye where we say hey we're looking at a

373
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:11,399
certain trait in a

374
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,759
plan it's basically that we've done it

375
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:17,720
so much that it's a learned thing so it

376
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,879
technically it is science like we're

377
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,920
basically piling down to to Gene Pairs

378
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,278
and frequencies of these desirable Jean

379
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:32,559
pairs things that we like that we want

380
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:37,039
to see more of so say for instance

381
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:39,679
um so I make that strain uh Grim right

382
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,399
you seen them big ass buds right oh yeah

383
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,198
so the mother plant the hash plant it

384
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,440
grows buds man like the biggest On's

385
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:52,198
probably about you know oh man it looks

386
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,600
huge because of the punching my head it

387
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,439
uh it it that's right y'all are

388
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,720
millimeters and centimeters uh so like a

389
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,519
bud would be like the size size of an

390
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,600
ink pen right the longest one yeah now

391
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:09,480
on the father's side it throws colas

392
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,798
that are the size of a man's forearm now

393
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,558
if I want to see those forearm

394
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:22,759
buds on that female plant I can say well

395
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:26,038
in our male we know that hey you know he

396
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:28,318
uh he looks like this the other male

397
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,720
looks like this other male looks like

398
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:34,678
this so we could say that male ju has a

399
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,160
thinner Leaf um maybe a particular smell

400
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:43,120
to the stem rub and say he's uh thin and

401
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,160
sweet say male number two is super wide

402
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:49,399
leaf and a little more fuy and say male

403
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,519
number three is something in between the

404
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,120
two now if we look at the sisters of

405
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:58,400
these males we could say that male

406
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,479
number two with the kind of big fat

407
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,360
leaves

408
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,360
his females you know counterparts his

409
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:09,279
sisters throw big huge colas right so

410
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,839
these two traits could be linked so big

411
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,158
fat Leaf could also be linked to big fat

412
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,879
bud and floral

413
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,600
cluster or it could be the opposite you

414
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,159
know so you would know to say that okay

415
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,079
so the male that I'm wanting to roll

416
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,360
with could be this big fat one if I'm

417
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:27,279
looking for yield so I take this big fat

418
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,879
wide Leaf thing I pollinate this hash

419
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,879
plant and then we look at the results so

420
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,280
now in the in the progyny man we're

421
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,120
looking at these

422
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,759
children and these kids man we notice

423
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,158
that you know you're still going to see

424
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,879
these thin leafed phenotypes you know

425
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,280
that maybe had the smaller bud and

426
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,600
you're also going to see the other

427
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:52,240
phenotype with the wider leaf and you

428
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:55,319
notice hey throwing big huge buds again

429
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,919
so we could refine this a step further

430
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:00,480
and take like a you know a male same

431
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,480
type deal fale and take it to an F2

432
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,919
generation and then we could do it again

433
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,880
and take it to an F3 and basically what

434
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,120
you're looking to do is if you were only

435
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,919
trying to do that one thing that's cool

436
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,038
but we're not that fortunate you know

437
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,919
our crops we're looking for smell we're

438
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,279
looking for flavor we're looking for

439
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,720
potency yield Vigor all these different

440
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,918
things so you're trying

441
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,360
to up the frequencies of all these

442
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,440
desirable things and

443
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:32,119
know how to find them by

444
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,880
these like I said these Gene pairs so I

445
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:37,639
might be looking at a leaf trait on one

446
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,960
with a smell trait I could be looking at

447
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,038
Health even the serration or how many

448
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,000
leaves that it's actually producing on

449
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:47,879
these fan leaves or a number of

450
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,759
different things there's root mass

451
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,159
there's speed of growth how long did the

452
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,558
males take to get to sexual maturity was

453
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,480
always a big one for me like as far as

454
00:19:54,558 --> 00:20:01,599
potency how fast does it veg does it veg

455
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,720
slow does it veg quick because all the

456
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,879
plants they have this energy in them you

457
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,759
know like so if he's not trying to grow

458
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,440
super quick that means his energy is in

459
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,759
there he's going to do something with it

460
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,159
so maybe it's going to be throwing big

461
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,960
massive guds and flour or maybe all his

462
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,480
energy is going into resin production

463
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,120
right so a lot of it is you know you go

464
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,200
off of these things first then you see

465
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,000
what you come up with at the end and

466
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,200
then you can assess it from there and

467
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,119
move forward um another step would be

468
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,360
instead of the filial generation

469
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:37,000
breeding we could take these and like

470
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:39,240
say back cross it you know so let's say

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,038
now I'm throwing these big massive huge

472
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,558
buds but I lost a little potency but the

473
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:46,480
mama hash plant man you know puts your

474
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,359
dick in the dirt so I might say well

475
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,599
I'll find my mail out of that F1

476
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,839
generation look for that big leaf trade

477
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:55,759
again for those big buds and then back

478
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,279
cross it back to the original mom and

479
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,440
try to regain some potency from there

480
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,279
you know

481
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,798
yeah so with kind of that same topic in

482
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,839
mind we see like Labs these days

483
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,798
offering tests claiming they can you

484
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,399
know tell the sex of males before

485
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,918
they've even got more than a couple

486
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,320
nodes going how do you think this kind

487
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,679
of thing plays into the scene do you

488
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,439
think it's like a fat or do you think

489
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,480
this technology will legitimately find a

490
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,240
use in most breeders

491
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,319
stable I think that what the price of it

492
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,038
and the availability of it coming that I

493
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,038
really do think that it would help if I

494
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,278
could put genetic markers on these

495
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:37,038
things like these pairs that I'm able to

496
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:40,400
see with my eye it would help me along

497
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,798
to be able to say well it's definitely

498
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
this you know there's sign backing this

499
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,599
up I had these markers put into place

500
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,919
for yield and potency so it would it

501
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,079
would help me along pretty good but I

502
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,360
mean you got to be a rich [ __ ]

503
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,918
to be able to afford all that right now

504
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,479
and you know guys like uh Sol myself

505
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,600
we've done it for so many years without

506
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,519
being able to go to a lab you know or

507
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:08,480
any of these things to where we can do

508
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,879
it do it by ey and putting it on paper

509
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,798
and recording these things so you know

510
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,679
it does help but on the other to and

511
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,038
like you don't AB absolutely need it it

512
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,880
is a nice thing don't get me wrong but

513
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:25,158
you know we can still accomplish what

514
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,600
we're looking to do you know without uh

515
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,720
without the labs and everything yeah for

516
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,000
sure so kind of uh how you just

517
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,159
mentioned you've been doing this for

518
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,640
years something I wanted to ask everyone

519
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,480
I interview is uh take me back to uh

520
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,480
when you first started smoking what was

521
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,400
your initial acquaintance with cannabis

522
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,960
you know was it a family affair was it

523
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,960
you and some friends getting up to some

524
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:50,798
Mischief so uh I had a friend in high

525
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:54,278
school and ironically enough his last

526
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:57,599
name is BL I don't know if yall SP once

527
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:01,038
over in uh over in Australia or not but

528
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,439
um so uh him and this other girl named

529
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,599
Jessica was little punk rock chick and

530
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,400
she had some good weed and we smoked it

531
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,480
and right then and there I loved it you

532
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,240
know it like made me feel real good and

533
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,960
calm and I was always kind of anxious

534
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,079
and I don't know a little uptight and

535
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,200
didn't really like people well I guess I

536
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,359
still don't like people too much it

537
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,558
really it did enhance yeah definitely

538
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,798
enhanced things so from there I'm like

539
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:32,359
well I'm going to take these seeds out

540
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:35,000
of this weed and I can grow tomatoes I

541
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:37,079
can grow everything under the Sun so why

542
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,440
should this be any different so I

543
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:42,278
started growing it and uh my cousins man

544
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,759
they they saw me you know what I was

545
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:47,359
doing I was 12 years old and I had all

546
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:51,400
these seedings sprouted up and they were

547
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:53,558
like you know look man it is what it is

548
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,440
you're doing what you're doing let's

549
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,599
let's help you do it a little safely so

550
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,840
you don't end up in prison you don't end

551
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,839
up all screwed up and we'll show you how

552
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:07,399
to do it the right way and basically

553
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:09,119
that year I turned into a water boy and

554
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,000
I would help him take large amounts of

555
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,278
water through the woods which really

556
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,558
suck because in Virginia summertime

557
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:19,079
temperatures like 11 Fahrenheit 80 90%

558
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,879
humidity It Feels Like a Jungle and uh

559
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:27,079
you got snakes man copperheads and water

560
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,880
moccasins and then you got you know uh

561
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,960
Hunters here they have these people

562
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,440
called game wardens that make sure that

563
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,399
you don't kill too many deer or whatever

564
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,880
the hell but they also during the summer

565
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,798
months they help uh help the cops locate

566
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,520
grows so they were showing me how to be

567
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,319
sneaky about it and how to hide it and

568
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,519
all the right things so something of an

569
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,558
apprenticeship and I got to learn yeah

570
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,398
how to make seeds for the next year or

571
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,519
the following years and um you know how

572
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:58,519
to locate the good plants and how to top

573
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,079
them or pinch them and make them bush

574
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:03,480
outout and how to feed them and how to

575
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:05,678
mix soil and uh make use of you know

576
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,480
what's around you and finding water and

577
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,038
such so that's kind of how I got kicked

578
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,159
off and so what was the scene like back

579
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,480
then was it all everyone was kind of

580
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,080
inly doing their own thing amongst their

581
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,839
kind of Hill is the expression I've

582
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:21,798
heard or was it more kind of people were

583
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,319
just starting to work together and get

584
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:26,798
the ball

585
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:29,359
rolling well in those days like in my

586
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,759
area at least it was uh um it was

587
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:35,319
something that you kept very very quiet

588
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,359
you didn't want to uh you didn't even

589
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,759
want people knowing you smoke weed

590
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:43,398
because like if that joker man he gets a

591
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:45,519
DUI even uh which is here it's driving

592
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,000
Under the Influence so you were drinking

593
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,720
beer and driving drunk you know so in

594
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,519
order for them to get out of trouble

595
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,319
they would say oh yeah officer you know

596
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:57,480
I'm drunk as [ __ ] but this guy up the

597
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,398
Street's growing weed or he smokes weed

598
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,960
or whatever they tell on you then you're

599
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:05,319
up in the damn uh prison and then

600
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,000
they're free so that there was that and

601
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,119
then other people would just bother you

602
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,440
all the time hey man sell me a little

603
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,038
bag I Just Want To Grim or it just more

604
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,240
trouble than it was worth so you just

605
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,519
kept everything super super super quiet

606
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,640
you damn shed it and let nobody know you

607
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:26,639
grow uh you uh that was like rule number

608
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:31,399
one you don't tell nobody nothing you

609
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,360
always keep it Qui it is can be yeah so

610
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:34,678
on your first couple of grows what were

611
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,678
they like you know what type of

612
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,840
Technology were you using and I think

613
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:41,320
more kind of interesting to me is what

614
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:45,240
was the quality

615
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:47,480
like so ironically like you know my

616
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,919
cousins man they started me off they

617
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,640
bought stuff from the super sativa seed

618
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,360
club that was their main place they like

619
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:00,360
to get their seed stopped sssc oh

620
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:02,479
awesome super awesome now now as a kid

621
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:05,479
I'm like well I'm looking at this

622
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,038
magazine they're like oh yeah bubble gum

623
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,440
blueberry this and that and I'm like oh

624
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:13,158
wow look at these pictures and that

625
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,960
looks like the [ __ ] man I'm I'm GNA I'm

626
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,200
going to buy this stuff and I'm GNA try

627
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,798
to grow this and then you find out that

628
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,120
it won't that good man it really won't

629
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:28,519
so genetically I was really started out

630
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:30,719
on the on the right path um fck far as

631
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:34,759
technology went in the early years I was

632
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,399
a strictly Outdoors Man um didn't really

633
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,119
want to set anything up

634
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:42,079
inside and not that I could I was so

635
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,000
young you know I didn't I didn't have a

636
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:47,798
place to do it but um so when I was 15 I

637
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,759
got kicked out of the house uh mom uh

638
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:53,278
caught me with a few pounds of weed I I

639
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,240
was stupid I was trying to stashing in

640
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,319
my closet and the whole house smelled

641
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,240
like a dead skunk you know just a few

642
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:03,519
pants um yeah just a few pounds man I

643
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,440
was just trying to get by you know need

644
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:09,839
to buy some comic books so um you know

645
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,399
that that happened and then um I went

646
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,959
down to the city which is like Richmond

647
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,798
Virginia and I was able to hook up um a

648
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,640
little apartment with a buddy and I was

649
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:22,240
like hey man I can grow us some more of

650
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:28,720
this you know he was like all right so I

651
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,720
got a uh it was actually a Street Lamp

652
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,720
and yeah wired it up and I hooked up a

653
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:38,199
single bulb with a parabolic reflector

654
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,079
um which is funny because that's how Mr

655
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,960
Souls got his rigged up right now but

656
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:44,918
he's kicking ass with it like I'll tell

657
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,200
you man these parabolic reflectors they

658
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:52,320
do a pretty good job so um so I hook up

659
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,000
one of those now growing outside I

660
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,079
mean I was kicking ass you know I do

661
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,519
real good so growing inside it was a big

662
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:03,839
learning curve because now I don't have

663
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,640
Mother Nature helping me so much man um

664
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:10,398
now it's kind of all up to me so it's

665
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:14,278
too hot too humid um I

666
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:16,639
mean it didn't look good man it I'm i'

667
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:19,839
been a sham like I wouldn't show show

668
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,080
nobody that [ __ ] it was awful

669
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,000
so so I start uh getting some books and

670
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:28,720
I'm like man I got to I got to figure

671
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
this indoor [ __ ] out so I got uh I think

672
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,399
it was Ed

673
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,359
Rosenthal closet cultivator and then I

674
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:40,158
had marijuana botney by Robert conel

675
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:42,759
Clark and the B was more like a college

676
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,240
textbook you know it it it taught me a

677
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:48,319
lot of

678
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,880
like why this cannabis plant is doing

679
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,038
what it's doing and why it's doing it

680
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,360
but the closet cultivator gave me some

681
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,319
ideas like hey you know you get a little

682
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,398
dehumidifier you know you're looking to

683
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,798
keep it around this temperature or this

684
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,879
temperature and a lot of little tricks

685
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,679
so I took it to heart I really tried you

686
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,240
know and I was like this I not having my

687
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,360
ass whipped by this indoor grow and I

688
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,599
made it happen and it turned out really

689
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:19,119
really good and then I just kept trying

690
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:22,199
to refine it a little bit each time you

691
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,839
know so and that's the other thing man

692
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,720
people all keep saying like oh that

693
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,480
guy's a master grower man he's a master

694
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,200
man I'm gonna tell you

695
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,720
the day you think you got that plant

696
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,000
mastered it will show you you don't know

697
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,360
[ __ ] man it will humble your ass so you

698
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,240
never Master it but you get a little bit

699
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,398
better each time you do it and that's

700
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,240
the thing don't ever close your mind you

701
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:48,079
know just keep it open and keep learning

702
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,919
and you know maybe not trying so many

703
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,519
different things but always be open to

704
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:55,320
try something different you know and

705
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,359
even if it sounds kind of weird and

706
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:01,240
crazy like when I started doing like m

707
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,079
and sugar and juice and you know pouring

708
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,599
it on these plants most people are like

709
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,678
dude you're insane man you're going kill

710
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,638
that [ __ ] and but I mean if you

711
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,360
break it down into the science of it and

712
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,439
you look at it you're like oh yeah that

713
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:17,678
that makes sense and then you know

714
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,558
proofs in the pudding so you know try it

715
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,320
out and you're like yeah it's

716
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:26,720
good yeah so um just touching back on

717
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:29,119
how you mentioned uh RC Clark and um a

718
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,079
few others who were the the uh the

719
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,239
people you looked up to in the early

720
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,480
days who were your go-to breeders and

721
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,519

724
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:48,398

725
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:51,599

726
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:53,678

00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:42,398
little tidbits and tricks you know like

744
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,240
one guy might have a cool little soil

745
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,518
recipe that you you know you add it to

746
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,200
yours or he might have a different way

747
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,919
of growing or breeding or you never know

748
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,120
and you just take all these little good

749
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,799
tidbits you put them

750
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,558
together and wham bam you know you start

751
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:59,839
coming up with some real winning winning

752
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,638
recipes you

753
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,240
know so uh sounds like you're in a

754
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:06,319
pretty fortunate position to be able to

755
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,720
chat to all of these awesome uh breeders

756
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,720
at the time where did the original

757
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,839
Brothers Grim fit into things for you

758
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,440
were they kind of hitting their Peak

759
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,119
popularity when you were getting into

760
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,960
growing like where did you see them in

761
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:20,918
their initial

762
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,840
Incarnation it was really weird because

763
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,919
like when I when I made my first order

764
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:31,119
uh in

765
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:35,360
2000 like they were known but not like

766
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:37,678
you know super hugely well known um I

767
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,798
don't really think people realized what

768
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,880
they had or how good it was until after

769
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:46,839
it was gone you know

770
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,559
um people would Overlook things back in

771
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,359
those days you know because you had your

772
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:54,200
old standby sounds like

773
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,398
today yeah yeah it's exactly like today

774
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,960
but we almost have like the opposite

775
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,879
problem because like like a million of

776
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,319
these guys that are like oh yeah we're

777
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,440
breeders it's like bro because you put

778
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:07,240
[ __ ] pollen on a on a marijuana

779
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,838
flower don't make you a [ __ ] breeder

780
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,039
man you're a seed maker a glorified seed

781
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:16,320
maker so you you got all this garbage

782
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,519
out there to try to root through but

783
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,119
back then there weren't that many people

784
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:24,599
doing it but people were very afraid to

785
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,599
to change you know and like for for good

786
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,599
reason too because there was a lot of

787
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,679
just chicken [ __ ] gentics in too but I

788
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,119
saw the

789
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:37,159
pictures um and like Soul's descriptions

790
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,720
of the [ __ ] like piak my interest you

791
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,000

792
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,000

00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,160
send it on up to Canada the Heaven

800
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,160
Stairway and I'm going to get a pack of

801
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:04,279
this [ __ ] and see what it's all about

802
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:09,039
and it was so good that it's

803
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:13,359
2016 or a DEA raid later and I still got

804
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:17,358
that same clone had I lost that I would

805
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:21,880
be so butt hurt man I'd be really mad if

806
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:23,239
I lost that man yeah so uh yeah I mean

807
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,920
you know they they were they were

808
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,959
getting an in back then but they just

809
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,440
didn't have the uh the recognition yet

810
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,400
and then it was definitely afterwards

811
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,960
everybody's disbanded and long gone

812
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,720
before people were like wow that was the

813
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,519
[ __ ] yeah for sure so how did you

814
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,239
initially get in touch with Mr soul and

815
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,280
kind of broach the idea of bringing

816
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,399
Brothers Grim back or did he come to you

817
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,200
with the

818
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,440
idea well

819
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,838
subcool uh hit me

820

little earlier yeah yeah so it was

824
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,240

you know working around each other we're

840
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:43,559
like yeah man you know start making some

841
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,440
seeds and we got the genetics we know

842
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,639
what to

843
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,960
do you know why not seems like the right

844
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,318
the Right Mix the right match and we

845
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,679
just said [ __ ] it the world what it

846
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:55,159
wants resurrect Brothers yeah give them

847
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,000
what they want man that [ __ ] they've

848
00:36:55,159 --> 00:37:00,719
been missing that's it that's it so when

849
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,318
you guys first started uh brainstorming

850
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,959
what were some of the initial ideas you

851
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:05,279
had for brothers Grim was it initially

852
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,960
let's just re-release some of the

853
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,760
classics and go from there or did you

854
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,599
kind of had some clear goals as to what

855
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,599
you wanted to do in the

856
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,599
future well we uh we definitely knew

857
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,800
that uh right off the bat you got to

858
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,400
have the classics um stuff that like we

859
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,480
were saying people didn't realize what

860
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,400
they had or what was out there until it

861
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,679
was already gone so you know having

862
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,200
Cinderella um um having the Apollos the

863
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,279
Rosetta all these old classics you know

864
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,239
that was a definite you got to have it

865
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,200
you got to have it out there um but we

866
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,199
did realize like hey you know we do have

867
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,399
all this original stock it's only so

868
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:46,439
much work to to get these done and back

869
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,480
out there but we already know that the

870
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,440
work from back in the 990s into the

871
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,679
2000s I mean it just crushes everything

872
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,480
that that's around today like I can't

873
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,440
believe these Jokers have been working

874
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,400
[ __ ] 15 years years and got this

875
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,639
chicken [ __ ] but

876
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:10,400
so yeah I'm GNA try to be nice man but I

877
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:12,639
mean for real [ __ ] man so we know like

878
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,760
that's already G to be good but we

879
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,799
looked at it like okay well where did we

880
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,560
want to go like what what else did we

881
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,000
want to do so we're picking up on some

882
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,719
of his old stuff and you know I had a

883
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,239
lot of my own things that I was looking

884
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,318
to do and things that I did way back

885
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,598
that were like great strange but I

886
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:33,039
didn't sell seeds you know I'd sell some

887
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,559
to like an outdoor farmer you know in

888
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:38,358
the northeast or you know just helping

889
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,480
friends out or growing them myself so

890
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,480
it's stuff that I know that the general

891
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,480
public you know they really dig it so we

892
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,639
were looking along the lines of that and

893
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,358
then you kind of look at like what's the

894
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,920
world missing you know like there's not

895
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:56,679
really any really serious good Haze

896
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,800
hybrids you know the JJ kicks ass with

897
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,239
the Kim dog you know what I mean um but

898
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,000
you know there's you know a lot more

899
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,039
work that can be done with the Kim dog

900
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,480
and stuff you know of course there's

901
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:11,000
like a million people out there like e

902
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,559
Sour Diesel and Seed form and it ain't

903
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,239
sour and it ain't diesel you know so you

904
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,960
know I thought that was a good one um

905
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:18,838
the skunk you know that kind of went out

906
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,039
back in the 90s people talk about oh

907
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:22,480
yeah road kill skunk's real awesome so

908
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,920
you know that was something we know you

909
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,760
have to resurrect that good Haze hybrids

910
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,800
good sativas basically all the things

911
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,000
that people want but it's really not out

912
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,599
there um and you know like a lot of the

913
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,480
Indica stuff too is you know real big a

914
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,640
lot of people are getting Indica stuff

915
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,280
and they're like oh yeah it's Indica but

916
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:46,799
it's really it's like it's more than a

917
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,599
poly hybrid and it's not really Indica

918
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,599
either you know it's not really that

919
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,200
good narcotic drug traits that we're

920
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,559
looking for you know the stuff that just

921
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,919
makes you melt in the couch like oh I

922
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,559
can't move man I want to get pizza but I

923
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,880
can't move so you know you need these

924
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:07,000
things back in your life so um and we

925
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,599
got our old genetic collection back it

926
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,159
goes as far back as 1978 some of these

927
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:16,640
clones so you know we're able to really

928
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,759
kick it off and get things rolling

929
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,960
proper again the way they should be you

930
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,880
know yeah so I've got a bit of a longer

931
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,318
question here but it does tie into those

932
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,400
indicates um so not too long ago I was

933
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:30,400
watching when Mr Soul was on the uh the

934
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,760
Adam dun show and um and he was speaking

935
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,760
about his former partner Sly and it made

936
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,280
me realize that you and him have a lot

937
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,280
in common in my opinion um and you know

938
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,280
I hope I don't paraphrase Mr Soul wrong

939
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,280
here but um he essentially said you know

940
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,640
not only did he help him with the

941
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,800
breeding but he helped him to kind of

942
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,078
round out the offering in terms of bring

943
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,160
some other strains to the table and it

944
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,800
certainly appears like you uh seem to do

945
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,279
that in terms of the Grim deer and the

946
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,800
hashm in the new release so how do you

947
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,119
feel about this comparison to Sly and uh

948
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,880
do you are these new Inda strains kind

949
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,480
of more your

950
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,599
children yeah man um I definitely I

951
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,199
really really like my indicas um soly

952
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,079
did a great job like uh one of my

953
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,358
favorite ones was called sugar blossoms

954
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,800
and um that was one that really didn't

955
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:21,400
make it out a lot but man it was really

956
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,560
killer so like on the same token like I

957
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:29,280
loved like the Cindy I loved the Apollo

958
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:31,599
but like green GI was was a great one um

959
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,400
the sugar blossoms was great the Grim

960
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,640
Widow was great so SL he was pretty

961
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,119
kickass dude himself man I'd say you'd

962
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:41,440
agree right bu

963
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,280
yeah got lucky

964
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,280
both yeah got lucky

965
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,759
twice and uh so when we look at the new

966
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,119
uh Brothers Grim offering just recently

967
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,000
put out um we noticed that some of the

968
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,760
strains have been slightly altered in

969
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,480
their genetic composition for re-release

970
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,079
such as the Rosetta Stone which now has

971
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,880
a pure Jack Hera mother as well as the

972
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,560
Apollo 11 which is now sort of a back

973
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,000
cross um why did you guys decide to do

974
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,519
this and how do you think it'll affect

975
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,039
them compared to say the former

976
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:18,440
editions so with the uh I'll start I

977
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:22,679
guess with the uh the Rosetta Stone um

978
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:26,000
so Cafe girl for for one it's it's goner

979
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:29,279
she's not to be had

980
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,519
anymore yeah even before I broke down

981
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,440
business yeah he was saying he was he

982
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,838
was planning to call her out before

983
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,440
before it even stopped but I would

984
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:42,599
say yeah it was like one of them things

985
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,159
some people like some people don't um

986
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,480
but the the the girl herself would have

987
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:52,719
been out of those three seeds the most

988
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,240
uh Jack leaning of the of the group um

989
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:58,118
me personally I say like the the the

990
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:00,919
genius is the most of the haze dominant

991
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:04,480
of the of the group The Princess to me

992
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,480
is more of the nl5 dominant out of the

993
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,960
group um

994
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,800
so when you want to do like like Rosetta

995
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:17,838
Stone the Jack hair

996
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,440
is just mindblowing what the one that we

997
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,440
use it's the same one that ceny would

998
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,000
have used

999
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,920
um Jack har even selected the selected

1000
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,199
the Clone

1001
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:36,159
personal cut very yeah exactly it's very

1002
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:41,279
very very stinky it's got that super

1003
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:45,679
lemon Pine Haze Funk uh yeah sandalwood

1004
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,920
and all it doesn't have yeah make

1005
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:51,598
a probably attract other men

1006
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,119
unfortunately y there we go we got the

1007
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,359
name

1008
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,519
man yeah man we're shutting down the

1009
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:01,558
seeds we're going into the yeah colon

1010
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:04,599
and fragrances so um but the structure

1011
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:08,079
of it that sativa Haze dominance out of

1012
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,680
it um made a made a better parent than

1013
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,079
the cafe girl would have ever made and

1014
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,480
um would have given you a better

1015
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,880
improved version of Rosetta Stone and

1016
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,760
kind of what it was intended to be was a

1017
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,720
very you know nice hazy put you put your

1018
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,160
mind in the

1019
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:29,919
clouds yeah a lot of Jack influence man

1020
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:33,879
that's what we're looking for yeah nice

1021
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,599
um as far as the um so the a11 is

1022
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,079
actually going to be just a11 it won't

1023
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,200
be a back Cross or anything we just had

1024
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:45,680
to go grow out a literal [ __ ] ton of

1025
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:49,799
Cinderella 999 and find the right mail

1026
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:54,719
to use and we've grown out more than

1027
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,720
what I'm even comfortable saying right

1028
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:01,880
now we got

1029
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,640
boy and that boy he's lined up back

1030
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,358
right in here we're going to make like a

1031
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:07,838
nice little little batch of nothing but

1032
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:11,358
a11 in there so we'll have that Cindy

1033
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:15,279
hitting the um the genius and making a11

1034
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:17,679
from scratch the um the Apollo 13 same

1035
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,480
way it's not a back cross it's just made

1036
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:24,039
from just made from scratch the same

1037
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,800
same way as it always was p75 the genius

1038
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:30,079
and you got it so everything made the

1039
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,119
made the same way but that Rosetta Stone

1040
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,079
that would be the one that is that is

1041
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,960
different nice but I mean we could

1042
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:38,640
totally argue it it's a bit improved

1043
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,119
even

1044
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,118
maybe awesome I'm sorry I didn't hear

1045
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,039
youor I was going to say I'm sure the

1046
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,880
Rosetta Stones

1047
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,920
improved oh yeah man I'm gonna uh matter

1048
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,920
of fact uh I'll take y'all on a little

1049
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,720
tour since we're talking about it man

1050
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,800
I'll show you a couple of the different

1051
00:45:54,719 --> 00:46:01,480
uh pheno types of the of the old Rosetta

1052
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,760
just got to walk upstairs man oh yeah

1053
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,440
here there a big ass Cindy Cindy Mom oh

1054
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,000
nice while we're talking about Cindy I

1055
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,119
got a quick question on it obviously

1056
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,159
Cindy is um actually a bx3 you know it's

1057
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:18,200
a it's another word for the princess bx3

1058
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:20,078
um in your ideal world would you want

1059
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:22,078
all Brothers Grim strains to be kind of

1060
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,119
true breeding and at that backcross

1061
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,039
level or do you think f1s have a good

1062
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:31,318
place in the breeding World little bit

1063
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:34,000
both uh so like uh the Sunday 99 that's

1064
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:38,039
uh four four bat

1065
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:42,358
crosses oh that makes it very breeding

1066
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:46,639
stop certain things I would say yeah so

1067
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:49,159
there's to me uh filial breeding and

1068
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,358
backat Crossing they're two different

1069
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:56,159
tools so certain tools work better for

1070
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:59,799
certain jobs so you could say like with

1071
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:02,440
Apollo and Apollo 11 they're way way

1072
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,400
better as an F1 just that original F1

1073
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,838
hybrid than they are as a backat cross

1074
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,920
or F3 F4 you start to lose things so

1075
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,199
certain

1076
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,920
strains you start to lose things in

1077
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:16,598
Translation you know um certain things

1078
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,559
you can you can back cross them Filly

1079
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:22,119
them out um and improve them even you

1080
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:25,240
know make them more potent or better

1081
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:26,519
right but um certain things they they

1082
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,558
just don't they don't like it you can

1083
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:31,480
lock found smell flavor structure all

1084
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:33,359
this but sometimes you start to lose

1085
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,400
that potency and a lot of that I

1086
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,960
attribute to the just that hybrid Vigor

1087
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,200
you know having two unrelated things or

1088
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,639
even two slightly related things go

1089
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:46,558
together and you you create a monster

1090
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,480
but you take it beyond that you might be

1091
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,839
able to keep a lot of it but some of it

1092
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,480
you know it's not going to be as good as

1093
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:58,318
that F1 so with us we're like you know

1094
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,079
it's got to be meet the parent or beat

1095
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:03,199
the parent we don't accept mediocrity

1096
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,599
man if it ain't as good or better it

1097
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,358
goes right down the [ __ ] man we a we

1098
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:12,640
ain't having it so we we want great not

1099
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:14,039
good you know yeah yeah through here so

1100
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,719
I'm not sure if you've noticed but there

1101
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,279
seems to be like a a current Trend among

1102
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,199
some breeders to just want to take

1103
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,599
everything to the F2 or the F3 do you

1104
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:25,358
think that this is a a bit of a the

1105
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,240
wrong kind of approach or do you think

1106
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:30,519
maybe they'd be better off maybe back

1107
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:34,279
Crossing things or just keeping them as

1108
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:35,920
f1s um certain things they could um so

1109
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,680
when somebody makes an

1110
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,720
F2 um a lot of people they don't have

1111
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,598
the concept of what's going to happen

1112
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:46,879
they think oh wow you know they took it

1113
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,838
to F2 it's going to be stable right but

1114
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,400
that's not the case man when you breed

1115
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:56,440
stuff to F2 if like I take um let's say

1116
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:59,358
I take like an indicia plan and a pure

1117
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,000
te a plant and I make a F1 and we're

1118
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:05,078
seeing like five phenotypes you know one

1119
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,599
should be more like the mom three should

1120
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:09,519
be like a blend of the two and then one

1121
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,480
should be more like the daddy so now we

1122
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,358
take it to an F2 and I think the ratio

1123
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,480
is like the [ __ ] is it man it's like

1124
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:19,519
9335 it so basically what happens is now

1125
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,838
you got every color of the rainbow yeah

1126
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,239
man it is all over the place you'll see

1127
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,199
stuff not only from the mom but [ __ ]

1128
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,798
from her mom and her dad and all these

1129
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:31,798
recessive things popping

1130
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:35,599
up yeah before you

1131
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:37,079
stabilize Yeah so basically you know

1132
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,640
you're just going to end up with this

1133
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,798
big nasty spread now it can be cool like

1134
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,118
if me and you are looking for a very

1135
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:47,519
very special

1136
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:49,720
something to use like yeah I mean it it

1137
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,519
could be cool but for people that are

1138
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:55,959
like oh well take like Girl Scout

1139
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:58,920
cookies right so you take that garbage

1140
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,920
right it's already a poly hybrid you

1141
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,920
even if you do make an F1 with something

1142
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,639
it's still a poly hybrid so now if you

1143
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,079
take that you make an F2 and you got

1144
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:11,039
[ __ ] all over the place and somebody's

1145
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,160
going to say hey man it's F2 Girl Scout

1146
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,639
cookies and they're going to show you

1147
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:17,440
this picture of a for cut Girl Scout

1148
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,159
cookies man you'll be hard pressed to

1149
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,880
find that sucker in them f2s you're

1150
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:24,639
going to see stuff all over the place so

1151
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,760
you know it it has its place but

1152
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,078
normally an F2 is like something that a

1153
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,880
you know a good solid breeding program

1154
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:34,519
and you're looking to really refine

1155
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,079
something during that F2 search or if I

1156
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,920
didn't find what I wanted to use as like

1157
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,480
say like a backat cross to Something in

1158
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,880
the mom I didn't really see exactly what

1159
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,039
I was looking for in my F1 population I

1160
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,079
might take it to an F2 to get that big

1161
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:49,679
diversity to find that rare thing that I

1162
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,039
am looking forward to where I have more

1163
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,159
of these Gene Pairs and one male per se

1164
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:57,880
to take that and then take it back to

1165
00:50:54,159 --> 00:51:00,519
the mom then use it um now taking things

1166
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:04,400
to F3 and F4 like I said you do

1167
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:06,639
stabilize them but you some strains like

1168
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,680
it some strains don't some of them are

1169
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,879
going to say yeah we're going to be

1170
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:12,440
structurally great but the potency is

1171
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,119
going to go down the smell is going to

1172
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,400
water down some of them get better so

1173
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,559
it's kind of a trial and error I guess

1174
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,599
from strain to strain to what you know

1175
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,160
what you're going to be able to

1176
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,960
accomplish I found that cubing like if

1177
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,118
you're looking for one specific

1178
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,960
phenotype and you're looking to lock

1179
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,519
down all the traits of that specific

1180
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:38,000
phenotype you're really hard pressed to

1181
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:40,599
beat beat the cubing meod yeah of course

1182
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,880
so uh just touching back on the girls SC

1183
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:45,000
cookies uh what's your general feelings

1184
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,079
about kind of these more fad strains you

1185
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,838
know your gorilla glues Your Girl Scout

1186
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:51,160
cookies and you know back in the day the

1187
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:52,558
blue dreams you know do you think these

1188
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:54,199
these strains have a place in the

1189
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,160
breeding world or would you just never

1190
00:51:54,199 --> 00:52:01,279
consider working with them um um I

1191
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:01,279
really wouldn't work with them

1192
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:10,280
um yeah exactly it kind of it is what it

1193
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:13,480
is um if you did want to put it into a

1194
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,599
seed form I mean you could go along the

1195
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:19,599
uh yeah that's nice huh um you could uh

1196
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,440
you could go along and say yeah man you

1197
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,119
know we'll cube out the Girl Scout

1198
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,960
cookie clone and uh we'll make it into a

1199
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,640
seed form now it could be done but I'm

1200
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,519
not trying to work on something that I

1201
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:33,759
don't even really like you know the

1202
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,199
thing about Girl Scouts it looks like

1203
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,400
super crazy resonance and it looks like

1204
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:40,838
it would hurt you man but it don't like

1205
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,960
I barely catch a buzz on the stuff it

1206
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:45,358
tastes real good but hell man I know a

1207
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,920
bunch of [ __ ] that tastes good I mean I

1208
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:50,000
go eat some girl scoutt cookies if I

1209
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,798
want to taste the [ __ ] you know but you

1210
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,440
know that's I guess it's subjective some

1211
00:52:51,798 --> 00:52:57,079
people like it I'm just I don't know

1212
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,079
I've had better yeah

1213
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,839
yeah so uh getting back on to more your

1214
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,680
kind of strains we've uh had some talk

1215
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:07,679
about the uh the Durban Tha Cindy 99

1216
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,199
possibly being re-released is there

1217
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,039
anything you might be a to share with us

1218
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,519
about

1219
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:14,519
that yeah we're actually working on it

1220
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:18,000
right now that uh that Durban that you

1221
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:19,679
actually saw so since the T SE club

1222
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,440
they're the ones that made the the

1223
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:26,239
Durban to high flyer um we don't we

1224
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:28,240
don't have it anymore sadly um super

1225
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:31,159
kill Str one of the best things I ever

1226
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:34,118
smoked in my wife I mean

1227
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:36,838
just ridiculously potent I mean make you

1228
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:40,358
scared you know you really get freaked

1229
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:44,159
out high so um basically what we got to

1230
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:46,759
do um we had the best outstanding Durban

1231
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:49,639
I've ever ever had ever seen I've never

1232
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,040
seen anything come close to this one and

1233
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:54,558
I have a really nice tie and now we have

1234
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,558
our Cindy mail so basically what we got

1235
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,280
to do we got to make it make it from

1236
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:03,599
scratch man so we are we are currently

1237
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,960
working on it the the first F1 outcross

1238
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,000
basically step one of it's actually

1239
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,280
getting ready to go down in like like 10

1240
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,920
days 14 days so it'll be something

1241
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,000
you'll see it by next year because we'll

1242
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,920
have to make two different sides of it

1243
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,519
and we'll probably actually use uh one

1244
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,639
filial cross to find what we're really

1245
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:27,000
looking for and then we'll take that

1246
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:29,039
back probably to the tie or depending on

1247
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,960
how The Offspring turn out what we're

1248
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:35,119
looking to lock down but yeah DTC 99

1249
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,760
will definitely be back out there CU

1250
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,838
that shit's killer

1251
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,440
man can we uh expect to see any others

1252
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,078
from the for menu released or do you

1253
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,480
think that might be the last of the

1254
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,039
first

1255
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,240
edition well we're looking at the um

1256
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:54,599
we're looking at the

1257
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:57,479
um the Green Giant um the Grim

1258
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:59,960
Widow and the D T

1259
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,199
c99 um those would be the first things

1260
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:06,318
that we really get to get to working on

1261
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:08,279
um other things that probably see like

1262
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,838
something like the sugar blossoms again

1263
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,559
you know the White Widow hybrid um what

1264
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:16,639
I'm really looking to do is um so it's

1265
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:18,839
kind of weird the uh the Kim dog D the

1266
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,879
smell the structure and a lot of things

1267
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:23,960
about that remind me a lot of the

1268
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,519
princess um and the genius actually

1269
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:29,358
reminds me a bit of the 91 in certain

1270
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:31,759
ways but kind of like on opposite ends

1271
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:33,960
of the spectrum um where the Kim dog is

1272
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,760
very much just crushes you man for the

1273
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,519
genius is so like uplifting so I'm

1274
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,920
actually looking to experiment a lot

1275
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:43,440
with the combinations of those two two

1276
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,159
different Gene pools and nobody else has

1277
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,760
really really messed around with it yet

1278
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:52,639
so that' be pretty pretty cool man

1279
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,039
awesome so uh keeping with the kind of

1280
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,558
topic of breeding what would be kind of

1281
00:55:55,039 --> 00:56:00,839
your number one adice viice for a a

1282
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:03,839
freshly starting out breeder in terms of

1283
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:05,119
what what are they best uh in terms of

1284
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,358
what what's their energy best spent

1285
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,318
doing should you be trying to grow out

1286
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,759
the largest numbers of one strain you

1287
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:13,159
can and trying to get you know your

1288
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,839
selection right or maybe a few different

1289
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:16,239
strains and trying to find some unique

1290
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,960
things to cross together what would be

1291
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,318
your

1292
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:24,639
advice I would

1293
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:27,798
say don't start breeding stuff unless

1294
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:32,598
you're super super super passionate

1295
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:35,038
about the weed like if it's just like H

1296
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,838
you know the weed's pretty good you know

1297
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:39,000
I enjoy it you want something that's

1298
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:40,679
really got your attention like wow this

1299
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,519
the best weed have ever had in my life

1300
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:44,919
it works for me better than anything

1301
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:46,838
I've ever had this is what I want man

1302
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:51,000
this is all I want you know when you

1303
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:54,199
have that type of feel to like that's

1304
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
what you what you really want um that's

1305
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:59,078
where it all kind of starts and then you

1306
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,159
might might say well I really like it

1307
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:03,920
but you know the structure on it is just

1308
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:06,558
God awful man you know so that might be

1309
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,680
your starting point is like hey I really

1310
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,519
love this stuff but I want to improve

1311
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:14,078
something or it might have everything

1312
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:18,079
you're looking for all inone and you

1313
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,960
just might want to stabilize that um I

1314
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,119
would

1315
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,639
say if if you know what you're looking

1316
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:28,680
for trait wise and stuff you wouldn't

1317
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:31,798
necess necessarily have to grow out huge

1318
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:34,399
populations but the more you grow the

1319
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:37,400
more opportunities you're going to

1320
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,318
see to find things that that that would

1321
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,440
go along with this breeding program

1322
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:43,000
better so where you might nail down like

1323
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,400
two out of the five traits you're

1324
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,400
looking to nail um if you grew out

1325
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,720
say 50 of these plants instead you might

1326
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,960
find that mail that you could lock down

1327
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,959
all these traits with this one male you

1328
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,880
know or a good portion of them so so the

1329
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,559
more is definitely the better you don't

1330
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,200
necessarily have to but it's probably

1331
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,960
going to take you longer to to get to

1332
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,318
get where you're wanting to go with it

1333
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:12,639
um but I would say definitely have a

1334
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:16,239
vision in mind

1335
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:18,440
um and it's good to have a good diverse

1336
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,598
pallet as they would say you know like

1337
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,000
uh if you wanted a good Chef I mean if

1338
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:24,079
the son of a [ __ ] has only cooked

1339
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,838
barbecue his whole life and ate barbecue

1340
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,720
his whole life you know you put him in a

1341
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:28,798
restaurant restaurant with like 50

1342
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:31,279
things on the

1343
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,880
menu it probably ain't going to be too

1344
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,880
good so it's pretty good to get around

1345
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,519
try different things grow different

1346
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:41,318
things and you can start to see things

1347
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:44,119
so like even in a poly hybrid like Girl

1348
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:46,719
Scout cookies right you grow that out

1349
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:49,440
man I don't see Girl Scout cookies man I

1350
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:51,959
smell Durban I taste Durban I'm starting

1351
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,000
to taste uh little bits of Lebanese hash

1352
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,960
plant you know I can start to pick apart

1353
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,318
all these different ingredients into

1354
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,798
this stuff because I've grown them all

1355
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:02,920
you know I've grown Northern Lights I've

1356
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,480
grown the skunk I've grown the Colombian

1357
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,400
and the Northern Lights Haze and pure

1358
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,760
Haze and you know anything you can think

1359
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,280
of and done grown it already and grown

1360
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,240
it in pretty good numbers to say yeah

1361
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,319
that's that feno that's that feno this

1362
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:18,879
is showing me this and that and I know

1363
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:20,519
this ain't going to breed worth of damn

1364
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,920
because it won't breed true for it and

1365
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:25,759
so on and so forth so I would say you

1366
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,639
know definitely make sure you know you

1367
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,240
you get well versed growing different

1368
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:32,480
things have a good goal in mind of what

1369
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,279
you want to do and make sure that it's

1370
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,519
something that you're really really

1371
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,720
loving you know like you're passionate

1372
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:40,960
about it so I would say that's the best

1373
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,078
advice I could give them and pay

1374
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,838
attention to detail like even the

1375
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:49,359
smallest things like uh the the

1376
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:52,798
serration on a leaf um and the the

1377
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:54,960
petales and the colors of of the of the

1378
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,639
stem and the flowers and the floral

1379
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,039
clusters and

1380
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:02,159
um the length between nodes and how they

1381
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:05,280
get tighter and like the ratio of how

1382
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,679
they get tighter and every little

1383
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,760
tiniest traits that you can think of

1384
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,078
even the lines and the leaves you know

1385
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,000
all these things they're all bound to

1386
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,200
something it could be something

1387
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,519
insignificant or it could be something

1388
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:22,159
big like these serrations might be

1389
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:24,798
potency that's tied to it could be yield

1390
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:27,078
it could be smell hell it could be fiber

1391
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:29,798
production and stock you never know or

1392
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:32,039
it could be something insignificant like

1393
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:34,559
what the the arrangement of these lines

1394
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:38,440
on this Leaf is associated with that you

1395
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,640
know serration so keep all those in mind

1396
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,519
and as you're growing them out you know

1397
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,519
see what happens like if you got notes

1398
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:47,239
saying all right they're thin they got

1399
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:49,440
real Jagged saw serration and they're

1400
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:51,639
tall and lanky you might notice those

1401
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,559
are your most potent ones and you might

1402
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:54,838
say the other ones aren't as potent so

1403
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:57,039
you know if you're going to find your

1404
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:59,838
male you might be looking for these

1405
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:01,559
female traits in a male plant might be

1406
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:04,759
okay I'd make sure I get the Sal

1407
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:07,119
serration thin Leaf you know lankier

1408
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,599
male is probably going to end up giving

1409
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,039
me what I want in my later

1410
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:15,720
generation great advice great advice so

1411
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:18,359
uh keeping on that theme of genetics um

1412
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:20,318
how do you think epigenetics plays into

1413
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:23,038
breeding you know I've heard people talk

1414
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:25,400
about this idea of seeds coming from

1415
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:27,440
really good uh breeding environments you

1416
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,519
know good plants that were taken care of

1417
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,200
well uh you know they perform better you

1418
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,079
know how do you feel about that

1419
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:38,358
idea absolutely man um

1420
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:40,240
so I had some buddies that made seeds

1421
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:43,838
I'm not even going to put put them out

1422
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:45,759
there like that but they um man they're

1423
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:48,599
terrible man they're terrible Growers

1424
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:51,920
and everything so they were making seeds

1425
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,960
on unhealthy plants man so now if you

1426
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,358
take like human beings for instance

1427
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,358
right and you got a mom man she smokes

1428
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:02,038
crack she drinks 40s of malt liquor man

1429
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,960
she she's fat and nasty and not healthy

1430
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:06,880
at all eats like [ __ ] man that baby's

1431
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,199
probably going to be premature it's

1432
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,358
going to be all [ __ ] up and nasty and

1433
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:14,719
you know not what you want now you take

1434
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:17,199
like say like uh some chick that's uh

1435
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:20,159
big into yoga and eating right and she

1436
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,759
takes prenatal vitamins and all this and

1437
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,798
that well when she gives birth to her

1438
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,720
baby it's probably going to be pretty

1439
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:29,318
healthy you know now it also plays a

1440
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:31,318
part in like was Daddy a big Olympian

1441
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:33,599
muscle builder and was she like a

1442
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:36,038
athletic type and you know that plays a

1443
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:39,000
part too but the health the overall

1444
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:42,599
health of her during that that time of

1445
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,440
carrying this baby uh definitely see it

1446
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,278
you know with the with the plants too if

1447
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,639
you got a good healthy plant that is of

1448
01:02:47,278 --> 01:02:52,239
a good genetic background and you

1449
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:54,000
facilitate seed growth and like um

1450
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,239
keeping these plants as healthy as

1451
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
possible and feeding them cuz seeded

1452
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:02,000
plant they eat a hell of a lot of food

1453
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,679
man so you got to feed them a lot um I

1454
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,119
try to facilitate seed growth by adding

1455
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:10,278
a boron any source of boron is super

1456
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:13,278
super crucial to to good seed

1457
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:14,278
development um amino acids derived from

1458
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:16,798
organic

1459
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:18,798
soybean um you know a lot of lot of

1460
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,599
extra little perks that I give them that

1461
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,719
I don't with say like a normal flowering

1462
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,000
plant you know that's like Cy crop or

1463
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:28,558
whatever and I do notice that when I

1464
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,960
Sprout my seeds I get a better

1465
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,480
germination um they tend to blow through

1466
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,960
the ground a lot quicker and I tend to

1467
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,079
see like a more vigorous plant more

1468
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:41,240
resistant plant against like disease and

1469
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:44,278
Pest and everything and they typically

1470
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:46,519
just overall bigger in health you know

1471
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:48,440
so I definitely believe that yeah you

1472
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:50,440
want to you want to take real good care

1473
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,400
of them when they're pregnant man or

1474
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:56,159
else they they'll let you

1475
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,880
know yeah for sure so uh We've seem to

1476
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,679
have gone through a few generations of

1477
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,358
different lighting technology within say

1478
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:04,598
the past 10 years you know we've gone

1479
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:07,920
from HIDs to LEDs and now we've got

1480
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:09,640
these double-ended gavita bulbs have you

1481
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,318
guys moved to gavita as your kind of

1482
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:12,920
gold standard as a lot of the industry

1483
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:16,920
has or do you think the technology is

1484
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,079
not quite there yet so um you know like

1485
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,920
I was talking about earlier it was on

1486
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:24,839
the old parabolic reflector you know and

1487
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:26,559
there was the HPS air cooled hoods so um

1488
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:28,880
like if you seen some of them pictures I

1489
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:32,160
put up last night of them flowers that's

1490
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,798
growing in a basement under old ass HPS

1491
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,598
hoods man like garbage wouldn't have

1492
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:39,318
thought

1493
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,680
so oh I know right but um so like if

1494
01:04:39,318 --> 01:04:42,400
you're growing real good and you give

1495
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,919
them what they need like you can still

1496
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,680
get good quality and you know good real

1497
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,400
good yields from them but I'm going to

1498
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:53,519
tell you these double ended

1499
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,838
lamps dude it ain't even fair man like I

1500
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,000
was hitting like three of light on HPS

1501
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:59,719
technology and like I'm using these

1502
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,318
things right now man I hope I don't

1503
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:03,318
blind you out but yeah no that's good we

1504
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:08,440
can see it

1505
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:12,199
well yeah man so those suckers man

1506
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:14,720
man yeah it it just makes it so much

1507
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:18,558
like the plants just get bigger buds

1508
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:21,038
bigger more dense um so I would say yeah

1509
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:25,720
the double-ended technology I would say

1510
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:28,799
is um very good I will say this say man

1511
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:30,159
y'all in Australia don't buy gavita they

1512
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:34,000
they're own by this company called

1513
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:36,838
Monsanto man Monsanto like the evil

1514
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,278
empire man like yeah don't support

1515
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:40,599
suckers at all man they're looking to

1516
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:43,599
take over the world and like not in a

1517
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:46,640
good way we got

1518
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:49,400
Nan nanolux man that's the company I've

1519
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:52,519
been using and I really really like

1520
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,920
their stuff um I'm not like paid by them

1521
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:57,079
I ain't sponsored by them or nothing so

1522
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:00,000
like I'm just like you you know I got

1523
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:03,480
money I try to make and

1524
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,400
um yeah I'm G I'm GNA spend it well so

1525
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:09,159
with the anals I don't see any failures

1526
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:12,240
with it um there's another brand out

1527
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:14,920
there called papalon ealon and the

1528
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,879
Phantom de and I noticed here in this

1529
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,159
Warehouse like when we had like

1530
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,200
blackouts or brown outs where the

1531
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:23,598
lighting kind of flickers man their

1532
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,798
ballast would just fail you know now

1533
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,240
with these nanoes man they don't skip a

1534
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:31,519
beat they don't break they're just great

1535
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:33,919
the Design's very streamlined so you can

1536
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:35,920
mount them better the price on them

1537
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,920
they're cheaper than gavita or any of

1538
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,920
the others and um they have a lot of

1539
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,400
really cool technology and features

1540
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,798
using like wireless controllers where

1541
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:49,200
they give you like a sunrise function

1542
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:51,480
where it might start off at 400 watts

1543
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:55,719
you know and then after 30 minutes it

1544
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,039
goes to 500 and it slowly creeps up over

1545
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:00,399
long you want to set it you can

1546
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:02,599
replicate a sunrise and a sunset um it

1547
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,599
has temperature sensing technology to

1548
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:10,039
where it says Okay um you know I know

1549
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:12,318
that this guy wants my temperature to be

1550
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:17,720
you know no hotter than 85 degrees at

1551
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:20,318
this canopy so when it hits 86 or 87 the

1552
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:22,480
light says oh hey man I'm getting it too

1553
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:25,838
hot for this guy so it goes from 1,000

1554
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:29,920
watts and it might go down to 950 Watts

1555
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:31,960
or 921 Watts whatever it needs to do to

1556
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,318
satisfy that temperature set point you

1557
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,599
know so they're really smart and really

1558
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:39,639
nice and hell man like I can even look

1559
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:42,359
at this [ __ ] on my phone pretty sweet

1560
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:43,440
man yeah yeah sorry for interrupting

1561
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,278
before I was just going to say yeah

1562
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,880
people in Australia are very aware of

1563
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:50,719
Monsanto and are definitely not fans of

1564
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,680
them so thankfully we're up to date on

1565
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:55,558
that good good so the next kind of bunch

1566
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:57,159
of questions are kind of not so breeding

1567
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:58,880
related more kind of uh the scene

1568
01:07:57,159 --> 01:08:00,519
related and this is kind of an issue

1569
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,160
which is fairly big in Australia because

1570
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:05,920
we're just in the very early stages of

1571
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:07,879
setting up our kind of medical model so

1572
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,039
my kind of first question would be how

1573
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,960
well do you think the American medical

1574
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:13,920
cannabis model is working for the

1575
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,560
patients you know do you think it's it's

1576
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,039
been a net positive or I hear claims

1577
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,640
about people saying things are going

1578
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:20,600
backwards you know what's your ideas on

1579
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:25,039
all of

1580
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:26,838
this well here uh here recently man I

1581
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:29,238
don't even if I should say it or not but

1582
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:33,238
like I just I just went legit like a

1583
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:35,198
month ago so I never took the medical

1584
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:38,119
thing very lightly there were a lot of

1585
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,599
people that were like well you can grow

1586
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:41,679
just go up the street and get this

1587
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,279
medical card and to me that was kind of

1588
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:49,759
a lie like I'm not going to pretend to

1589
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:51,880
grow for a sick person like they're not

1590
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,759
really sick I mean they got a achy back

1591
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,520
the same way as I got a achy back you

1592
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,880
know what I mean like we're all sick and

1593
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:02,040
that regard right yeah but they so there

1594
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:05,440
was that that whole thing now there are

1595
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:07,640
sick people who are genuinely really ill

1596
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:10,079
that can use this stuff and those were

1597
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:13,759
the people that I wanted to take care of

1598
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:17,399
so I never in my life had really run

1599
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:20,880
into these really really chronically ill

1600
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:22,920
people um mainly because like I don't I

1601
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,560
don't really get out much you know I'm

1602
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:28,000
constantly growing and the way it was in

1603
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:31,798
the old days you don't talk to people

1604
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,719
you know you kept it quiet so I came in

1605
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:35,519

help you out then that makes my day and

1617
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,760
then I'm actually doing my job so the

1618
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:07,599
way it went here was there was no like

1619
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:10,079
real legal recreational thing so

1620
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,560
everybody was like oh medical medical

1621
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:16,238
medical so these real actual sick people

1622
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,520
you know they were you know kind of had

1623
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:21,399
people giving them weed or selling them

1624
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:24,040
weed or they had a dispensary so now in

1625
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:26,559
the states where it went

1626
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:28,719
recreational man and a lot of these

1627
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,960
people they got thrown to the Wayside

1628
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,800
nobody wants to mess with them no more

1629
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,760
because they went and they got that Rec

1630
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,679
license and now they're just you know

1631
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:41,520
kind of [ __ ] out of

1632
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:44,359
luck yeah so no one's no one cares about

1633
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,520
the medical patients anymore yeah man

1634
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:50,599
sadly enough um there are places where

1635
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:55,520
they still do um and it's kind of Hit

1636
01:10:50,600 --> 01:11:00,560
and Miss on an individual basis too so

1637
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:03,440
you know it it's set up pretty good

1638
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,480
um I don't know it's just it it really

1639
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:08,479
just comes down to the individual I

1640
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:10,198
guess um if you're good people you know

1641
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,839
good things you know you can do good

1642
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:15,279
things for other good people but just

1643
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,520
know like if y'all get medical going

1644
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,039
there's going to be a lot of rat

1645
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:23,000
bastards out there but they're already

1646
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:26,840
there anyway so just uh guess the best

1647
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,319
thing say is just do the right thing do

1648
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,840
what's in your heart and try to take

1649
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:33,079
care of sick people because there are a

1650
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:35,279
lot of sick people who do need it and if

1651
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:38,158
you can do a good job you know grow some

1652
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:40,880
good clean organic good quality medicine

1653
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:43,238
for them man that's that's a good thing

1654
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,480
you know good thing to do good karma on

1655
01:11:43,238 --> 01:11:47,439
you yeah thankfully there are some

1656
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:49,759
people in Australia who kind of uh still

1657
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:52,479
look after six sick people or regardless

1658
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,639
of the legal status but uh I guess in

1659
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:58,000
that kind of same idea um for for a

1660
01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:59,920
country like Australia that is just you

1661
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,319
know about to say kind of legalize

1662
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,079
things in the foreseeable future what do

1663
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:05,599
you think is maybe some of the traps or

1664
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:07,920
pitfalls you know some of the ideas that

1665
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,800
were presented as a good idea at first

1666
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,560
which now in retrospect you realize were

1667
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,000
not good things for the

1668
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:18,080
states right so that that's like a big

1669
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,399
crucial thing so like a lot of people

1670
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:22,319
they say oh wow you're going to legalize

1671
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:25,399
weed that's great I'm going to vote Yes

1672
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,158
for it but really look at what that law

1673
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:29,439
says because like right now in

1674
01:12:27,158 --> 01:12:32,279
California they're trying to legalize it

1675
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,198
there but legalization with the

1676
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:37,559
California market with the bill that

1677
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:40,799
they're you know trying to push through

1678
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:43,840
basically makes it worse really than it

1679
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,079
ever did you know before it was legal so

1680
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,319
like now it's like if that were to pass

1681
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:50,198
and you get caught with an ounce of weed

1682
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:52,960
hey you're a felon now man like they're

1683
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:55,559
going to send your ass to prison um so

1684
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:59,158
basically it's set up for like big

1685
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:00,719
corporations to control everything so

1686
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:02,559
like they'll make it to where you're not

1687
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,279
allowed to grow your own for yourself

1688
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,920
you're not allowed to grow anything for

1689
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:09,519
a sick person they got to go to their

1690
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:12,639
local Monsanto growery and buy their

1691
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:15,800
cheap dog [ __ ] Eagle 20 ridden spider

1692
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:17,400
might infested crap you know so whatever

1693
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,960
they do put in front of you just make

1694
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:21,599
sure you y'all read it real good man

1695
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,319
because they you know governments are

1696
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,280
sneaky I don't know about Australia but

1697
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:28,479
I know in America you got to watch them

1698
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:32,119
suckers man they they'll [ __ ] you any

1699
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:34,479
chance they get man yeah well one of the

1700
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:37,000
uh the major arguments or kind of ideas

1701
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:39,119
put forward is that uh legalization will

1702
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,238
be somewhat similar to Tobacco in

1703
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:44,479
Australia in that there would be a few

1704
01:13:41,238 --> 01:13:46,158
large companies running it all and very

1705
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:48,439
likely the potential of people not being

1706
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:50,000
able to grow their own medicine how do

1707
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:52,000
you feel about that idea do you think

1708
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,119
it's kind of intrinsically important for

1709
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,079
people to be able to grow their own

1710
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:59,079
medicines or do you think uh you a big

1711
01:13:56,079 --> 01:14:00,639
Monsanto type company is adequately able

1712
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:04,158
to provide for

1713
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:06,279
people yeah so when I worked in Virginia

1714
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:08,799
doing like engineering and

1715
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:11,119
instrumentation and all that good stuff

1716
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,840
I used to work for a company y'all got

1717
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:16,198
marbor cigarettes over there don't you I

1718
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,880
think you can get them here so I used to

1719
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:23,119
work for those people they're uh called

1720
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:26,079
Philip Morris but um so with the tobacco

1721
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:29,158
industry or any industry for that

1722
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:33,439
matter they're high

1723
01:14:29,158 --> 01:14:36,799
volume low quality I highly doubt you

1724
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:40,519
would get anything beneficial from them

1725
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:42,719
um here in the old days we used to have

1726
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:46,320
basically we call it a swag Market you

1727
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:49,560
know it was illegal weed grown in Mexico

1728
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:56,039
mostly coming a brick real cheap

1729
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:59,080
pesticide ridden not very good um to me

1730
01:14:56,039 --> 01:15:02,679
those type of places will fill that swag

1731
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:05,119
void if they do produce anything at all

1732
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:08,399
but what you can do for

1733
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:10,158
yourself at your own home is far

1734
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:13,279
superior than anything that you'll be

1735
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:16,319
able to buy in a store so even in this

1736
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:20,759
market like I'm in Colorado right now if

1737
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:23,479
I go to the store looking for weed man

1738
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:25,520
I'm pissed dude like it it's awful

1739
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:28,359
looking man so like what I can just do

1740
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:31,280
in my basement will kill anything you'll

1741
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:33,119
find in a store around here so they're

1742
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:35,679
not going to put the same amount of love

1743
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,519
into it as you are and you're not going

1744
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,920
to know like what did they spray that

1745
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,320
[ __ ] with and did they pull it too early

1746
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,440
did they pull it too late do they even

1747
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:46,479
grow what the hell you need you know

1748
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:49,479
like for your for your ailments you know

1749
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:52,319
so if you got Crohn's or whatever and

1750
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:54,638
all they got is Girl Scout cookies you

1751
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:56,599
[ __ ] out of luck man you know you need

1752
01:15:54,639 --> 01:15:59,880
something you know more specific for

1753
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:03,239
what you're looking to do so I would say

1754
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:06,600
being able to grow grow your own is huge

1755
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:09,399
you know and my thought has always been

1756
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:12,360
until they consider cannabis the same as

1757
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:15,119
a tomato plant no regulations it's a

1758
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:17,559
plant as any other plant until that

1759
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,399
happens I'm not happy I'm still like

1760
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,719
[ __ ] them you know I don't like being

1761
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:25,519
regulated at all so [ __ ] these [ __ ]

1762
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,319
man they you know plant some PL and

1763
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,920
especially it's medically good for

1764
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:33,198
people shame on them for even trying to

1765
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:35,520
regulate it you know yeah so uh

1766
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:38,119
obviously you're an organic fanatic like

1767
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,400
myself uh what's your opinion on

1768
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:42,319
Organics versus synthetics in terms of

1769
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:45,119
you know do you think synthetics just

1770
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,679
reduce the flavor and the Turin or do

1771
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:49,760
you think it actually reduces the

1772
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:53,560
medicinal value compared to

1773
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:57,840
Organics well that's a good question man

1774
01:16:53,560 --> 01:17:01,120
so I've seen a lot of hydro weed some

1775
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,920
people can do it good and do it right

1776
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:06,359
and I grew Hydroponics myself even you

1777
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:10,679
know way back in the day when it was a

1778
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:12,799
cash crop thing um you can grow a good

1779
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:16,319
product

1780
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,600
hydroponically but I can grow a better

1781
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:21,960
product organically I guess you could

1782
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:24,480
say um it still would have a medicinal

1783
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,039
benefit but you would get more medicinal

1784
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:30,079
benefits you know of course from a

1785
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:33,279
better product and that being organic um

1786
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:36,519
I found that growing organically it was

1787
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:39,000
less maintenance it's actually less work

1788
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,520
the plants actually grow better and

1789
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,479
bigger um that used to be the argument

1790
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:47,719
of a hydro guys that well you know you

1791
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:51,519
might have a better taste or smell or

1792
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:53,920
whatever but hey I yield more well not

1793
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,239
not the way I grow organic you don't you

1794
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,560
know you might meet it maybe you know

1795
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:02,198
but I'll take the pupsy challenge on

1796
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:05,199
that [ __ ] too so um you know honestly

1797
01:18:02,198 --> 01:18:07,359
it's cheaper it's easier um you know

1798
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:09,198
it's better for you that's for sure you

1799
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:11,559
don't have to worry about flushing

1800
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:13,559
[ __ ] plants for 14 days to get [ __ ]

1801
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:16,320
out like you know I'm not going to put

1802
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:19,520
nothing in it that you know I don't want

1803
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:22,599
so I don't know it's just kind of nasty

1804
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,840
weed I have one buddy that grows hydro

1805
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:28,239
and he's probably like h the only person

1806
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,279
I know of that actually does a good job

1807
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:33,359
that I would actually smoke but if he

1808
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:36,519
were to grow in Organics [ __ ] man it'd

1809
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:38,359
be that much better you know yeah he

1810
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,600
only does it out of necessity though

1811
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:42,679
like it's the only way he can grow in

1812
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:46,960
his current current

1813
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:49,000
situation yeah yeah so uh I'm not sure

1814
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,600
if the idea is as pre prevalent in

1815
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,560
America as it is in Australia but

1816
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,440
currently there's this big Trend to kind

1817
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,480
of push CBD as the uh the medical

1818
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:00,919
component of weed and to push THC as the

1819
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,519
recreational component how do you how do

1820
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,158
you feel about this and do you think

1821
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,159
it's a bit of a

1822
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:11,359
misrepresentation yeah absolutely um so

1823
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,600
like if you look at the research the so

1824
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:16,599
CBD you know prevents like the

1825
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:20,079
metastasizing of cancer cells whereas

1826
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:22,199
THC actually kills the cancer cells so I

1827
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:24,960
actually see them both like you don't

1828
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:28,439
want just one you know one or the other

1829
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,198
you would actually you want both um and

1830
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:32,879
then there's like the medicinal benefit

1831
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:36,599
of like Tarpin you know whether it comes

1832
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,880
off of a CBD plant or a THC plant like

1833
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,639
marine and all that good stuff like they

1834
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:45,079
all have their own their own medicinal

1835
01:19:41,639 --> 01:19:47,199
benefit so you know having one without

1836
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:50,359
the other as far as the medicine goes

1837
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:52,158
they're kind of pissing in the wind so

1838
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:55,079
you know you you definitely got to have

1839
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:58,359
both um you know and that not just for

1840
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:02,719
cancer but for anything anything really

1841
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:06,799
pain um nerve nerve damage stuff um

1842
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:08,679
gastrointestinal stuff um depression you

1843
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,520
know there's so many different benefits

1844
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:14,440
for the stuff you know so and it's not

1845
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:19,480
as simple as just THC gets you high and

1846
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:21,839
CBD heals you you know yeah even in

1847
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:25,839
recreational Le you want to know call it

1848
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:28,400
that the different canabo profiles

1849
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,760
change the different kind of high the

1850
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:35,439
perceived high can be greater

1851
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:39,280
from a plant that has lower overall THC

1852
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:42,198
than another but its profile more CBG

1853
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:43,960
and CBN is we don't know what that code

1854
01:20:42,198 --> 01:20:46,319
is yet but there is definitely an

1855
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:49,198
interplay the different cannaboids that

1856
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:52,559
add up to something that's uh greater

1857
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:54,238
than the sum of basically and we don't

1858
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,120
understand how it all works yet but it's

1859
01:20:54,238 --> 01:21:00,079
certainly not as simple as just pure

1860
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:01,960
thhc just ex that leave everything

1861
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:05,158
behind that's not going to be the

1862
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:07,198
solution neither is getting just pierc y

1863
01:21:05,158 --> 01:21:12,119
cuz like you can smoke say like a Thai

1864
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:16,000
plant right 12% THC right I can go get a

1865
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:20,279
Afghan plant 12% THC I smoke that tie

1866
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,639
and I'm like oh geez that's strong man

1867
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:26,000
I'm GNA got to go hide um then I could

1868
01:21:23,639 --> 01:21:29,480
smoke that 12% s indica and just be like

1869
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,359
nodding out so what's the difference THC

1870
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:36,638
is THC it's the whole profile it's the

1871
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:40,039
THC in combination the other canono the

1872
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:44,000
propyl canono you know your thcv and all

1873
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:46,399
that good stuff um in combination with

1874
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,600
you know the tpin that's what makes a

1875
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:52,079
tie a tie and a gany aany you know and

1876
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:55,600
an indica and a sativa differences you

1877
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,639
know and the different um

1878
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,920
medicinal benefits of that like you take

1879
01:21:57,639 --> 01:22:02,199
somebody with like ADHD bouncing off the

1880
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,840
walls man I could give them a nice

1881
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:05,960
strong sativa and probably chill their

1882
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,679
ass out you know whereas I give it to

1883
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,719
this other dude or myself and I'm like

1884
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:14,440
oh Jesus man that's too much

1885
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:16,840
man yeah so touching on that Synergy

1886
01:22:14,439 --> 01:22:19,000
that kind of uh you and Mr Soul just

1887
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,800
mentioned we often hear people talk

1888
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,119
about how they will say you know kind of

1889
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,600
like your example with that tie or a

1890
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:27,679
haze for example you know these strains

1891
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,400
would never test as high as what strains

1892
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:32,560
do today however people would often

1893
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:34,079
claim there's no seiling to them um how

1894
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,239
do you think that gets lost you know do

1895
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,880
you think that's just a overtime over

1896
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:40,599
hybridizing strains you lose that or you

1897
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,920
gain a ceiling in the high because a lot

1898
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,719
of people will claim that you know new

1899
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,359
strains have a a ceiling you know

1900
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:47,399
whereas some of the older ones don't and

1901
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:50,039
that was why they were so

1902
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:53,439
memorable there is there is that like

1903
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:56,039
there's certain ones that yeah the land

1904
01:22:53,439 --> 01:23:00,039
race um there is something pure in those

1905
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:01,920
chemo types that really doesn't have

1906
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:04,800
that ceiling and if you look at a lot of

1907
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,359
the old hybrids like say like the derent

1908
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:09,320
Tha high flyer that had no ceiling and

1909
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:13,198
you could get so high you turn white

1910
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:15,679
faced and sweaty and puke um yeah they

1911
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:18,119
they were they were based off of land

1912
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:21,319
races you know deran Pinetown deran

1913
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:23,599
sativa and pure Thai um they didn't

1914
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:26,119
water it down they had two land races

1915
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,600
and they stabilized them well they paid

1916
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:30,719
attention to to their breeding program

1917
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:32,239
and they didn't accept mediocrity man

1918
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:35,279
they they made sure it was strong as

1919
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:36,678
[ __ ] every time they did it and yeah so

1920
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:39,399
you can lose

1921
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:42,079
some do doing some bad breeding

1922
01:23:39,399 --> 01:23:46,158
practices um the other

1923
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:49,359
thing the the testing so like you guys

1924
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:54,599
over there y'all see uh Girl Scout

1925
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:57,880
cookies or whatever tests 35% THC 40%

1926
01:23:54,600 --> 01:24:00,639
THC I'm G tell you that's

1927
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:03,440
[ __ ] the guy that got that tested

1928
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:05,960
probably knows the guy at the lab or the

1929
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:08,198
lab says hey if we keep turning out

1930
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,760
these big numbers for these guys they're

1931
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:12,039
going to keep coming to us to get the

1932
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,800
testing done right so if the guy at the

1933
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:16,880
corner is giving you a real test on it

1934
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:20,719
and he's like yeah you're like 18% THC

1935
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:23,760
which is a [ __ ] lot by the way um guy

1936
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,880
down the street gives you 32 so now in

1937
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,719
the market

1938
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,319
say like in Oregon for instance that's

1939
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,920
probably like the biggest place I see

1940
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,759
this problem is that there's guys

1941
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:36,800
they're like going to the dispenser with

1942
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:41,679
weed that says yeah this test at 42%

1943
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:43,639
THC [ __ ] man so now the guy at that

1944
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,319
lab is making a killing because

1945
01:24:43,639 --> 01:24:47,039
everybody wants to go get tested with

1946
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:49,759
him they get these good numbers now at

1947
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:53,519
the dispensaries the whole Market is

1948
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,960
driven by THC percentages so like you

1949
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,880
got like un educated public they think

1950
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:03,319
THC is the only thing getting you high

1951
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:08,239
so like we got Apollo 13 at Apollo 13

1952
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:09,599
like on a real actual legit test is like

1953
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:13,238
I think it was like

1954
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:16,239
16% but I'll tell you what man my God

1955
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:19,198
that 16% gets me higher than any

1956
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:22,718
so-called 30% Gorilla Glue that I've

1957
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:25,439
ever had um so you know there there's

1958
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:29,359
quite a bit of [ __ ] part of that

1959
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:31,319
and really I mean on a legit test like

1960
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:34,079
my buddy gets his stuff like

1961
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:36,880
legitimately tested the same Bud that we

1962
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:38,639
could take up and get 35% it's really

1963
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,760
only about

1964
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:45,359
22% so you know it's it's a few

1965
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,920
different few different factors involved

1966
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:49,880
in that and because something's

1967
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:52,520
resonance doesn't mean that it's very

1968
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:55,920
high in THC like you've seen those

1969
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:58,639
pictures of that 88 G13 hash plant right

1970
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:02,840
yep and you seen how Frosty that is

1971
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:04,920
right covered in snow oh yeah where you

1972
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:07,920
where do you think of test at

1973
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:11,719
THC uh if I had to guess those wild

1974
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:14,480
figures probably 29 or something

1975
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:16,840
30 yeah that's what I used to think

1976
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:18,799
too yeah it's like uh

1977
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,760
19% oh

1978
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:24,600
wow yeah I've seen uh pictures of peyote

1979
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,400
purple which is a notoriously low th see

1980
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,719
percentages but very

1981
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:31,319
frosty yeah man very frosty and it's all

1982
01:26:29,719 --> 01:26:33,560
those other things in it like you know

1983
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:35,960
that 88 I don't even like smoking that

1984
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:39,440
[ __ ] man it's too damn strong like I

1985
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:41,399
mean it just I mean it's like a time and

1986
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:44,039
place it's like doing acid or something

1987
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:46,719
man like you there's the right place the

1988
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:49,158
right time around the right people um

1989
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:51,520
and it just makes me eat man like I

1990
01:26:49,158 --> 01:26:54,079
can't keep fridge with groceries in it

1991
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:57,159
man I'll be eating pizzas and pudding

1992
01:26:54,079 --> 01:27:00,479
man man and chips and dip man it it

1993
01:26:57,158 --> 01:27:03,079
ain't no good so it's good for somebody

1994
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:05,000
had stomach problems so you know yeah

1995
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:07,359
yeah so do you think we'll ever get to

1996
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,600
the point even with accurate testing and

1997
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:13,158
new technology where we can ever uh

1998
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,440
quantitatively put the medical value of

1999
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:15,759
cannabis on a plant or do you think

2000
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:16,839
we're never going to be able to put a

2001
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,239
number on it you know there's always

2002
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,279
going to be a Synergy and you're just

2003
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:24,959
going to have to try you

2004
01:27:20,279 --> 01:27:28,439
know yeah I think uh part of it

2005
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:31,600
part of it I think so like what gets me

2006
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:33,759
just completely blistered man like it

2007
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,159
it's just like the best things since

2008
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,800
sliced bread for me I could give it to

2009
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:41,439
Mr soul and he would agree like oh yeah

2010
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,119
this is very good but something else

2011
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:46,439
works for him so I think a lot of it has

2012
01:27:44,118 --> 01:27:49,479
to do with just the uniqueness of like

2013
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:51,759
how our brains are wired and we're all

2014
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:56,198
individuals so I think part of it going

2015
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:58,440
to do with that but I do think that you

2016
01:27:56,198 --> 01:28:02,359
know across like a large enough Baseline

2017
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:05,039
I can say like 88 G13 hashplant makes me

2018
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:07,158
starve and hungry everybody I smoke it

2019
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:10,439
with they just want to eat and eat and

2020
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:13,000
eat so certain things like that are you

2021
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:15,519
know they ring true across the board so

2022
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,880
as we're starting to kind of like

2023
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,880
document these things and you know keep

2024
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:23,000
our records because like in the old days

2025
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:26,239
you couldn't keep records you know um so

2026
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,158
now we can uh the lady that was getting

2027
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:31,799
me all hooked up with all these people

2028
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:34,319
that I'm growing for that are real real

2029
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:37,840
sick she's got a person that works with

2030
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:40,238
the University of Colorado and he's very

2031
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:43,360
very interested you know he's master

2032
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:45,479
degree PhD doctor guy right he's very

2033
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:47,839
interested in like recording all this

2034
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:51,678
data that we're coming up with of what

2035
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,760
works for what and so it turns out like

2036
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:56,079
I knew all these people were very sick

2037
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:58,960
but it turns out that their illnesses

2038
01:28:56,079 --> 01:29:01,800
are kind of like rare illnesses you know

2039
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:04,359
so it's kind of cool to see what's

2040
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,920
working for for for these certain things

2041
01:29:04,359 --> 01:29:10,479
and then you got more common things like

2042
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:12,800
cancer research and you know neuropathy

2043
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:15,039
you know uh you know you got in a bad

2044
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,279
bike accident your nerve endings are all

2045
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:19,800
screwed up and what works for that

2046
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:22,158
versus the next thing and I really do

2047
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:25,800
believe that at the end of the day it's

2048
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:28,599
going to come down to the the tpin the

2049
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:31,480
individual tpin and how they help affect

2050
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:33,000
it because like a lot of people think oh

2051
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:34,198
yeah we're just going to cook you know

2052
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,840
we're going to cook this [ __ ] in the

2053
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:39,079
butter yeah we're good

2054
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,440
bro yeah yeah I'm gonna take him next

2055
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:43,000
door and show him them [ __ ]

2056
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:48,238
monsters you out of

2057
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,238
here yeah yes you thinking

2058
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,198
Wendy's all right Bubba I'll see you

2059
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:55,239
yeah I'm sorry about that that's all

2060
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:57,399
good all right Bubba

2061
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:59,519
um so yeah I think it's going to come

2062
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:01,719
down to these tpin and like people say

2063
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,639
oh yeah you know I'm going cook some

2064
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:05,359
canabus butter and that's like a cure

2065
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:07,079
all and you know I'm going to give it to

2066
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:09,238
this guy and I'm GNA give it to that guy

2067
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:12,238
well man when you cook

2068
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:13,479
it you got high temperatures man you

2069
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,279
going to you going to cook all them

2070
01:30:13,479 --> 01:30:19,399
terpins off so by the time we're said

2071
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:22,800
and done we've converted Delta 9 THC to

2072
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:24,599
Delta 11 thc's and we got a whole [ __ ]

2073
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,960
ton of CBN now

2074
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:30,320
you know degraded

2075
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:33,239
THC and it's kind of kind of D function

2076
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:36,158
kind of the same whether it's taii or

2077
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:38,559
whether it's an indica or whatever so I

2078
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:40,719
think a lot of it really does boil down

2079
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,320
to you know the smells that we're

2080
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,118
smelling you know and how these things

2081
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:47,960
help like they just found out like uh

2082
01:30:45,118 --> 01:30:50,279
the mercine tpine do you find out a lot

2083
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,600
in like your purple strains your indicas

2084
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:55,158
right they work on the same receptors as

2085
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:57,119
opiates do so like I had buddies back

2086
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:58,920
home man they were all hooked on Heroin

2087
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:01,079
and everything right bunch of dope

2088
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,520
fiends I could give them good indicas

2089
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:05,158
man get them off that dope one it help

2090
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:07,880
with the stomach so they ain't throwing

2091
01:31:05,158 --> 01:31:09,960
up so damn much and two it's acting on

2092
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:11,960
that same receptor as that dope was so

2093
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,719
they're not jonesing for the dope so now

2094
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,719
they're smoking good indica and then

2095
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:18,719
they able to kick that heroin you know

2096
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:20,800
what I mean so like there's all types of

2097
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:23,039
benefits yeah that's interesting I've

2098
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,639
I've heard of people being able to quit

2099
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:25,960
heroin with but then you hear about

2100
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:27,520
other people who say it's not so

2101
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,520
effective so maybe it's just a case of

2102
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,119
some are getting the right strain for

2103
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,800
the

2104
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,920
situation

2105
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:38,039
exactly okay so um just kind of on a bit

2106
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,039
of a different uh note if someone kind

2107
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:41,920
of asked me to summarize you know the

2108
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:44,359
kind of the current scene I would say

2109
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,118
that we're almost having a a bit of a

2110
01:31:44,359 --> 01:31:48,118
Renaissance of the past you know if you

2111
01:31:46,118 --> 01:31:50,279
look at people like Frenchie canoli

2112
01:31:48,118 --> 01:31:53,000
bringing back kind of the old hashish

2113
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:55,000
forms and then furthermore like we could

2114
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,800
definitively that there's an organic

2115
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,960
Renaissance going on people are really

2116
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,639
getting back into it um do you do you

2117
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,880
kind of agree with these trends that we

2118
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:05,840
need to go back to the old practices

2119
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,880
kind of Back to Basics and look to

2120
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,520
master the methodology as opposed to

2121
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:14,400
develop new

2122
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:17,920
technology yeah so so I used to make

2123
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:21,920
hash all back in like 98

2124
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:25,840
99 made it up to like 2003 yeah we used

2125
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:30,039
to call it BHO butane wall AKA hippie

2126
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:32,679
crack so I'd make the [ __ ] out of it man

2127
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:35,439
now I knew damn well that stuff won't be

2128
01:32:32,679 --> 01:32:37,679
so good for you man and when I'd smoke

2129
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:41,079
it I mean it gets you gets you good and

2130
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:44,000
good good and big but it won't nowhere

2131
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:46,198
near as good as some good dry SI or

2132
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,319
bubble hash that was made

2133
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:51,399
properly um so I think it's it's going

2134
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:53,079
to come down to a good blend because

2135
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:55,638
like there are some pretty cool

2136
01:32:53,079 --> 01:32:58,238
technology out there now but if we could

2137
01:32:55,639 --> 01:33:00,199
kind of integrate some of those old ways

2138
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:01,959
into a little bit of our new technology

2139
01:33:00,198 --> 01:33:03,719
like take like the rosin guys for

2140
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,840
instance right they're making the rosin

2141
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:07,480
now hey that's a pretty good little

2142
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,600
alternative right there you know you

2143
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:12,479
don't have any solvents there's nothing

2144
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:15,719
to purge out tastes good smells good get

2145
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:19,158
you baked um so I think yeah if people

2146
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:21,719
were to start becoming a little more in

2147
01:33:19,158 --> 01:33:23,479
tune with like what what we used to do

2148
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:26,359
back in the day before there was you

2149
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:28,000
know dab rigs and all this [ __ ] you know

2150
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:30,399
you could sit down in your house with

2151
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,118
the bubble bags and make all the hash

2152
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:34,279
you wanted and you didn't have to worry

2153
01:33:32,118 --> 01:33:36,118
about blowing your house up you know you

2154
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:38,238
didn't have to worry about some cancer

2155
01:33:36,118 --> 01:33:41,198
causing damn hydrocarbons up in your

2156
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:42,519
[ __ ] you know and it it tasted great you

2157
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:45,079
know it was awesome that's what you

2158
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:47,639
wanted to do so like me personally man

2159
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:50,039
like I don't I don't smoke no pass oil

2160
01:33:47,639 --> 01:33:52,480
man I'm probably in like the dab capital

2161
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:54,519
of the world right now dudes around here

2162
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:57,479
smoking looking like crackheads with

2163
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:59,840
torches and [ __ ] so I don't touch it man

2164
01:33:57,479 --> 01:34:02,479
but I will make my own bubble has I will

2165
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:05,560
make my own dry SI I got no problems

2166
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:07,319
with that but I do I only it's kind of

2167
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,960
like a rare occasion you know like if

2168
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:11,960
you're into drinking right you know

2169
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:14,279
people drink beers casually you know you

2170
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:16,920
and me after work whatever but hey on

2171
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:19,319
the weekend time to start doing shots of

2172
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,920
bourbon or whatever so I kind of think

2173
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:24,439
of it as the same way or if like I'm

2174
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,600
really hurting man my back is tweaked or

2175
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:29,759
whatever I can say hey man I'm gonna

2176
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:32,520
load up some bong hits or whatever of uh

2177
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:35,079
you know this draive and really kick my

2178
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:37,320
ass and feel feel like a human

2179
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:38,960
again yeah so it's kind of interesting

2180
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:41,319
you say that because in Australia the

2181
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,079
concentrate kind of game is just taking

2182
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:46,118
off and people are really jumping all

2183
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:48,600
over the BHO would your kind of uh

2184
01:34:46,118 --> 01:34:50,519
advice be stick to the more solventless

2185
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:54,039
types of concentrates if

2186
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:57,400
possible I would um like I do know some

2187
01:34:54,039 --> 01:35:00,639
guys that are very good at making uh

2188
01:34:57,399 --> 01:35:03,000
BHO um but they also have a laboratory

2189
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:05,400
and they have a lot of very expensive

2190
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,399
equipment yeah man it it ain't like

2191
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:09,879
blowing through like old stainless

2192
01:35:07,399 --> 01:35:14,000
turkey basters and some P back on the

2193
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:16,679
back porch right so um I would say you

2194
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,600
gotta kind of know where your stuff's

2195
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:21,440
coming from because if you talking to

2196
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:23,719
like Joe around the corner he might not

2197
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:25,960
be purging it too good man and that a

2198
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:28,520
Ain good for your lungs but you might

2199
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:31,560
know a guy you know couple miles down

2200
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:34,960
the road that does do a good job and you

2201
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,800
you can enjoy it but I would say try

2202
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:39,439
some

2203
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:41,880
dryv um You probably won't see a lot of

2204
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:44,839
it in your area like it's never been a

2205
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:46,880
big thing even here in America right

2206
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:48,239
like they you don't really go to the

2207
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:51,000
store and say hey there's some

2208
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:54,079
solventless draive because that BHA it's

2209
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:57,279
easier to make but what you can do is is

2210
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:59,279
you can get your grow on grow your own

2211
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:02,238
and then uh you know get you some dry

2212
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:04,439
sing screens and just make your own and

2213
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:06,638
like I mean it's cool little dab rigs

2214
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:09,118
and all that it's too much work for me

2215
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:11,880
but they are cool and if you got one you

2216
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:13,799
like to do it you can do it with the dry

2217
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,600
all you got to do man once you got them

2218
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,239
heads good and clean and it's nothing

2219
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,199
but trike heads you take that you apply

2220
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,238
a little heat and some parchment paper

2221
01:36:20,198 --> 01:36:24,719
and you pull it off man and it looks

2222
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,519
just like shatter and you you can dab it

2223
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:29,880
and it it tastes better and it'll get

2224
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,960
you way way way more [ __ ] up man uh

2225
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:34,719
you don't lose any tpin doing dry you

2226
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,480
know you don't lose a thing and it's

2227
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:40,520
pure it's clean and it's good for you

2228
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:42,118
too man yeah awesome yeah and you're

2229
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:44,440
right unfortunately I've uh never been

2230
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:46,279
able to try any dry C but uh it's on my

2231
01:36:44,439 --> 01:36:49,919
bucket

2232
01:36:46,279 --> 01:36:52,479
list um so people often talk about this

2233
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,480
idea of returning to land race routes

2234
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:56,479
you know do you think this is the case

2235
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,000
and it will get done it seems like it's

2236
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,919
been this idea that's been floating

2237
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,639
around forever but no one ever really

2238
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,359
seems to do it or at least it never

2239
01:37:01,639 --> 01:37:05,359
seems to take hold within the community

2240
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:08,079
you know do you think we'll just

2241
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:11,079
continue hybridizing

2242
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:13,880
endlessly well you got so you look at

2243
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:16,399
the mass public you know guys that are

2244
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:19,039
trying to make seeds and this and that

2245
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,920
but the thing with them is most of those

2246
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:24,639
guys are chasing a buck they ain't

2247
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:27,359
chasing a passion so there are some guys

2248
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:29,199
over here they're very passionate um

2249
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:31,039
couple friends of mine in California

2250
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:32,759
that's all they do they don't even sell

2251
01:37:31,039 --> 01:37:34,639
the seeds they could they could sell

2252
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:36,639
them and probably make a fortune but

2253
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:39,800
their main thing is Preservation you

2254
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:44,039
know everything from old Colombians and

2255
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:46,400
Mexican oh Hawkins taii and Cambodian

2256
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:48,079
anything everything you can think of and

2257
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:50,719
they want to make sure that it remains

2258
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:53,800
pure and it remains safe in a good seed

2259
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:55,880
form and maybe eventually they will sell

2260
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:57,920
but they're more into like you know

2261
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:00,679
giving them to a guy like me and say hey

2262
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:03,239
you want to use it in a hybrid or

2263
01:38:00,679 --> 01:38:06,880
whatever and I'm like oh yeah you you

2264
01:38:03,238 --> 01:38:07,959
damn right man so I can say that when

2265
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,679
you

2266
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:13,319
do like all these guys with the poly

2267
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:15,960
hybrids and stuff I could take something

2268
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:18,238
from them introduce a land race to it

2269
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,480
and make it pretty damn potent there is

2270
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:24,118
something to be said for reintroducing a

2271
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:27,238
land race back into a hybrid

2272
01:38:24,118 --> 01:38:30,279
that really does does does the trick

2273
01:38:27,238 --> 01:38:33,079
like that gria that's a Afghan land race

2274
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:35,039
right there that's been reintroduced to

2275
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:38,000
what you know was a worked hash plant

2276
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:39,238
which is like three different really

2277
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,439
really nice

2278
01:38:39,238 --> 01:38:44,399
Afghan um from different regions of

2279
01:38:42,439 --> 01:38:46,919
Afghanistan that they bred together in a

2280
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:49,638
breeding program at ciny to make the old

2281
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,960
hash plant so I'm just reintroducing

2282
01:38:49,639 --> 01:38:55,679
land race Vigor back into it and you

2283
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,719
know you could can you can definitely do

2284
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:00,639
some damage man yeah great and so do you

2285
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:03,079
think we'll ever see you know the the

2286
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:04,880
new skunk number one type thing or you

2287
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:07,599
know the new Northern Lights 5 or do you

2288
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:12,199
think we're maybe a bit past those

2289
01:39:07,599 --> 01:39:14,000
days oh no man I know this dude he's uh

2290
01:39:12,198 --> 01:39:19,039
he's working pretty hard Around the

2291
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:23,560
Clock uh working on those um I would say

2292
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:26,880
what month is it man it's uh July July

2293
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:29,119
yeah so I'd say around Christmas time be

2294
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,400
looking for uh looking for a roadkill

2295
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:33,639
scun that'll be coming from us we're

2296
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:35,279
growing them out right now like earlier

2297
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:37,400
when I was in that bright ass room

2298
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:39,479
before I got to rambling on bitching

2299
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:42,879
about Girl Scout cookies or whatever I

2300
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:44,638
was in a whole whole room full of uh uh

2301
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,118
different stuff uh we had the roadkill

2302
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:51,159
skunk up there we had the Rosetta Stone

2303
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:53,719
some a13 etc etc but yeah like that's

2304
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:55,399
another one of my big ones uh that was

2305
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:57,399
something pretty near and dear to me

2306
01:39:55,399 --> 01:39:59,679
like when I was growing up and my

2307
01:39:57,399 --> 01:40:02,519
cousins had made it and everything and

2308
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:05,560
it's something that I don't know why it

2309
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:07,800
really isn't around or nobody was on to

2310
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:10,760
the same [ __ ] we were on to back then

2311
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:12,480
but we're going to bring that back and

2312
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:16,719
that's something definitely people hey

2313
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:16,718
do y'all got skunks over there in

2314
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:25,719
Australia um no no like the

2315
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:30,199
animals yeah yeah we don't we don't have

2316
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:32,319
them man they stink so godamn bad man

2317
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:35,839
they will spray and if you hit one on

2318
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:37,840
the road your car will wre I mean really

2319
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:40,279
re heard the St in the region of

2320
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,920
Virginia I'm from they're all over the

2321
01:40:40,279 --> 01:40:44,960
place man so we could get away with

2322
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:47,480
growing big big big huge grows of it in

2323
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:50,599
the woods because people drive by and go

2324
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:53,359
oh God what do that smell like yeah a

2325
01:40:50,599 --> 01:40:55,520
skunk spraying around here I guess man

2326
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:58,359
don't realize in the back 40 we got like

2327
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:00,080
200 300 of them girls growing you know

2328
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:04,679
the perfect cover

2329
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:06,639
story oh yeah it was good that's awesome

2330
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:09,279
yeah so I'm going to have to do it bring

2331
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:10,319
up the dreaded topic for all breeders

2332
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:12,439
feminized

2333
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:14,399
seeds how what's your thoughts on

2334
01:41:12,439 --> 01:41:17,279
feminized seeds I could probably guess

2335
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:19,319
but I think that um there is a bit of an

2336
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:22,238
argument to be made that you know a lot

2337
01:41:19,319 --> 01:41:24,799
of really good clones have come from

2338
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:26,519
hermaphrodites from feminized seeds you

2339
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,039
know so so what's your thoughts do they

2340
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:32,800
have a place or not in your

2341
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:34,880
library well they do um and like

2342
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,159
anything like there's uh like we were

2343
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:39,800
talking about filial Crossing or back

2344
01:41:37,158 --> 01:41:44,359
Crossing so there's certain tools that

2345
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:47,119
you can use for certain jobs so with

2346
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:48,719
femin see there's a right way to do it

2347
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:51,719
and then there's the wrong way to do it

2348
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:53,960
so the wrong way is like the typical way

2349
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:56,279
of just like hey man

2350
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,840
we'll get some collidal silver man we'll

2351
01:41:56,279 --> 01:42:00,479
reverse this sucker and make a bunch of

2352
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:03,920
seeds and we'll just throw them out

2353
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:06,718
there um there is a a a right way of

2354
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:09,079
going about it too um which would

2355
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:12,639
basically be like during your first

2356
01:42:09,079 --> 01:42:14,158
first uh it's not really an outcross but

2357
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:17,159
during your first selfing where you've

2358
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:21,238
hm this plant onto itself or another

2359
01:42:17,158 --> 01:42:22,879
plant um our trick was you know you you

2360
01:42:21,238 --> 01:42:23,759
grow out a bunch of them you put them in

2361
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,239
a room

2362
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:28,159
and about day 28 a flower you start

2363
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:30,039
doing a disco light effect up in there

2364
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:32,118
where your lights on lights off lights

2365
01:42:30,039 --> 01:42:33,519
on lights off and you try to you know

2366
01:42:32,118 --> 01:42:35,799
you'll weed them out you'll find the

2367
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:37,599
ones like they'll show pretty quick now

2368
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:39,880
out of like you know hund and something

2369
01:42:37,599 --> 01:42:42,119
of these females in there you might find

2370
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:44,480
one that will not Herm out on you not

2371
01:42:42,118 --> 01:42:46,920
easily that would be one that you would

2372
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:51,359
probably want to back cross back to the

2373
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:53,760
mother or do it do it like that now when

2374
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:55,679
you're when you're feminized and you're

2375
01:42:53,760 --> 01:43:00,639
you're cheating yourself out of a

2376
01:42:55,679 --> 01:43:03,000
chromosome um it could be one that's not

2377
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:05,599
not so much affecting what we're looking

2378
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,560
for you know it could be a a structural

2379
01:43:05,599 --> 01:43:10,920
thing or a color thing or what have you

2380
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:14,159
um a lot of the times guys do it it's

2381
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:16,079
cheating out the potency a lot of it so

2382
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:18,238
I think like you can do it good but you

2383
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:19,960
need to have a lot of numbers and you

2384
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:21,079
need to run these stress tests or else

2385
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:23,480
you're going to be passing that

2386
01:43:21,079 --> 01:43:24,800
hermaphroditic trade on and and you're

2387
01:43:23,479 --> 01:43:27,559
actually you're going to be cheating

2388
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:30,039
yourself out of a a good chromosome like

2389
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:34,560
potency or something like that so like

2390
01:43:30,039 --> 01:43:37,079
you can do it but to me like if you do

2391
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,880
it right it's more work and like I'm not

2392
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:42,399
trying to do any more work than I need

2393
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:44,480
to so um you know and there is like you

2394
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:47,479
know I was talking to some guys they're

2395
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:50,000
from Europe and dudes in Spain and down

2396
01:43:47,479 --> 01:43:52,479
in South America and like they're not

2397
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,520
set up like like an America man like our

2398
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:57,718
service like on a house like electrical

2399
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:59,920
service you got like 200 amps like you

2400
01:43:57,719 --> 01:44:02,000
know it's pretty pretty good man you can

2401
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:03,960
you can grow out a lot of weed but say

2402
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,079
in Holland man you you're you're getting

2403
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:09,639
ready to like blow your breaker panel by

2404
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:11,679
having one light you know so um it's

2405
01:44:09,639 --> 01:44:14,118
very important for these guys to know

2406
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:16,639
for a fact hey I got females man I don't

2407
01:44:14,118 --> 01:44:18,439
have much space and like it's worth it

2408
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,560
and like I can sympathize with that a

2409
01:44:18,439 --> 01:44:24,359
little bit so I could see where a guy

2410
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:26,599
wants to do that um agricultural guys

2411
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:28,639
let's say like we're so legal that we

2412
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:32,199
can grow out fields and Fields and

2413
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:34,000
Fields of weed 100 acres worth of pot um

2414
01:44:32,198 --> 01:44:37,158
it would be beneficial that if I could

2415
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,279
grow from seed each time and throw out

2416
01:44:37,158 --> 01:44:41,359
all these seeds and know for a fact I

2417
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:43,279
don't have any males to call there will

2418
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:46,799
not be any gaps in my rows I'm going to

2419
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:48,679
be good to go that's pretty cool too so

2420
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,119
and like you were saying a lot of the

2421
01:44:48,679 --> 01:44:53,560
the really good ones came from accidents

2422
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:55,559
man really good accidents

2423
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:58,239
you know but accidents nonetheless from

2424
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,560
a hermaphrodite so you know there is

2425
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:02,919
some some things to be said like that

2426
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:04,560
Kim dog man every time like if that

2427
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:07,319
thing gets pissed off and throws out

2428
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,639
some pollen everything it hits makes a

2429
01:45:07,319 --> 01:45:12,000
legend man but that's just part of the

2430
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:14,239
way it breeds man it it breeds that

2431
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,800
chemotype along with that that

2432
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:19,079
hermaphroditic pollen so when it hits

2433
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:21,440
something it's God awful potent just

2434
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:23,719
like the mom was you know so there's

2435
01:45:21,439 --> 01:45:26,158
certain ones that will do that but not

2436
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:27,880
all of them do that so just you know

2437
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:31,638
that's the only part to keep in mind I

2438
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:33,800
guess yeah so what's your thoughts on um

2439
01:45:31,639 --> 01:45:35,520
people using other breeders genetics you

2440
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:37,760
know do you kind of frown on people

2441
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,560
making f2s and then using them for their

2442
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:42,320
own projects or do you think as long as

2443
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:45,440
they kind of ask permission it's all

2444
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:49,039
right yeah the permission thing is is

2445
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:52,439
probably like my my one thing and the

2446
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:56,359
way like we do stuff we actually

2447
01:45:52,439 --> 01:45:59,238
encourage enage people to to use our

2448
01:45:56,359 --> 01:46:02,198
stuff to to help their breeding program

2449
01:45:59,238 --> 01:46:04,959
along our only thing is like just you

2450
01:46:02,198 --> 01:46:08,238
know give us a little a little shout out

2451
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:11,039
you know don't be like oh well Sun 99 or

2452
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,399
Durban T c99 I'm going to call it

2453
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:16,279
cantaloup pay now or something like that

2454
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:18,519
and I'm G like yeah we just bred that we

2455
01:46:16,279 --> 01:46:20,359
made it you know now if they were to be

2456
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:22,760
like oh yeah it's Brothers Grim blah

2457
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:24,839
blah blah we use this in our program

2458
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:27,159
that's that's pretty cool and you know I

2459
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:29,279
like that and like we kind of saw

2460
01:46:27,158 --> 01:46:31,359
ourselves as like the Breeders breeder

2461
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:33,000
you know we'll make [ __ ] that you would

2462
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:35,238
want to breed with you know something

2463
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,760
that would help you out so Cinderella

2464
01:46:35,238 --> 01:46:41,598
99's a good example of that um as far as

2465
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:44,440
like people that make like f2s and

2466
01:46:41,599 --> 01:46:48,679
they're like oh yeah I got these grimo

2467
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:50,479
f2s $20 a pack you know what I mean now

2468
01:46:48,679 --> 01:46:52,679
that that pissed me off a little bit I'd

2469
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:53,959
be looking to kick that dude's ass yeah

2470
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:57,599
but

2471
01:46:53,960 --> 01:47:00,760
um you know um it's

2472
01:46:57,599 --> 01:47:03,520
it's I guess like I just see a lot of

2473
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:06,880
like very unui people out there that do

2474
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,920
this stuff and I just I guess I would

2475
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,319
say like I wish they would like do some

2476
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:13,880
of their own work and not really just

2477
01:47:11,319 --> 01:47:16,079
ride off others people's work because

2478
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,880
you know it it is a lot of work if you

2479
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:20,920
if you are going the original route

2480
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:22,480
whether you're snatching up land races

2481
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:24,920
from you know different parts of the

2482
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:29,399
world or you know putting a lot of work

2483
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:31,079
into something um it does take work but

2484
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:33,519
that you know some people they they take

2485
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:37,279
that shortcut but when I see a seed

2486
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:41,760
company that say their whole menu is you

2487
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:45,238
know TGA subcool's agent orange cross to

2488
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:48,239
um JJ's starg and then they just throw a

2489
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:51,759
name on it and their whole

2490
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:54,559
menu oh man all over the place man and

2491
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,440
like every time I just see it I'm shake

2492
01:47:54,560 --> 01:48:00,639
my head man like shame on you you

2493
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:02,799
unoriginal bastards so you know that

2494
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:04,520
part kind of bothers me and they don't

2495
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:07,960
really put in the work either they're

2496
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:10,440
just kind of like sprouted a 10 pack got

2497
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:13,158
two males that one looks good and that

2498
01:48:10,439 --> 01:48:15,118
one looks good [ __ ] it make some seeds

2499
01:48:13,158 --> 01:48:16,879
make some money you know and then they

2500
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,559
just end up polluting the Jean Pool

2501
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,560
worse than it already is you know they

2502
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,199
didn't improve nothing they didn't

2503
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:25,199
really make nothing new and they just

2504
01:48:22,198 --> 01:48:26,960
kind of screwed around now I do have

2505
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:30,399
friends that have like you know they're

2506
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:32,880
like uh what do you call like a closet

2507
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:35,799
you know closet breeders right but the

2508
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:37,520
difference between them and these guys

2509
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,239
well they ain't selling them they just

2510
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,960
goofing around having fun in the

2511
01:48:39,238 --> 01:48:43,158
basement and just growing [ __ ] out for

2512
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:44,719
fun you know that's a different thing

2513
01:48:43,158 --> 01:48:46,479
but when you're putting it in a pack and

2514
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:48,760
you're putting a label on it and you

2515
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:50,839
charging people for money and you're

2516
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,320
showing you know some picture or

2517
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,840
something in a description that ain't

2518
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:58,519
nowhere near like what it is man that's

2519
01:48:54,840 --> 01:49:01,480
fugazi bro like that that ain't cool

2520
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:03,360
yeah so kind of on that same topic of

2521
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:06,718
ownership I've been hearing a lot of

2522
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:09,399
talk about uh patenting of strain names

2523
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:11,198
patenting of strains recently you know

2524
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:13,679
are you able to maybe shed some truth on

2525
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:15,559
it there seems to be a lot of rumors um

2526
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:18,000
but from what I've heard it seems like

2527
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:19,440
the end of the Cannabis Community from

2528
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,359
what some people are talking it seems a

2529
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:23,399
bit

2530
01:49:20,359 --> 01:49:25,399
ridiculous yeah it is man yeah there's

2531
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:28,000
one thing you know about Stoners man

2532
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:29,839
they they paranoid and they like to uh

2533
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:35,359
like to have their little conspiracies

2534
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:37,760
and things so uh a while back uh talked

2535
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:39,479
to a guy that was doing like a Genome

2536
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,840
Project and I was giving them all these

2537
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:44,759
samples of all these different things

2538
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:46,360
out of the collection and like okay well

2539
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,480

cool stuff and I was like so you know

2551
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:16,639
when you map this this this plant can

2552
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:18,480
you give me a piece of paper saying you

2553
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:22,440
know this is what it

2554
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:25,759
is this is a very unique genotype here

2555
01:50:22,439 --> 01:50:27,919
you can't replicate this um you know

2556
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:31,679
when the patent office opens up can I

2557
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:34,399
patent this the answer is no unless you

2558
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:36,639
genetically modify something you can't

2559
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:38,519
patent it so that's how like Monsanto

2560
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:41,599
does what they do they genetically

2561
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:43,599
modify potatoes soybeans and [ __ ] so now

2562
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:46,840
they're able to patent those things

2563
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:49,880
right but they can't patent the

2564
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:51,760
soybean and we can't do it the the same

2565
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:53,840
way with cannabis you know so like my

2566
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:56,000
question was like well what if I get

2567
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,440
land races from all parts of the world

2568
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,118
can I patent these so that way when

2569
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:02,719
Monsanto does come around hey I done

2570
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:04,238
beat these [ __ ] to the punch and

2571
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:06,118
maybe I'll sue them and we'll we'll have

2572
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:08,879
a big ass bonfire in their office

2573
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:10,799
buildings or something you know so they

2574
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,960
were like no it doesn't work that way so

2575
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:16,920
unless you genetically modifi it to make

2576
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:20,639
it unique you can't patent it so that uh

2577
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:23,760
now the the names so the name game yeah

2578
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:26,599
you can you well I don't know about

2579
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:28,840
abroad or nothing but in America you you

2580
01:51:26,599 --> 01:51:32,159

he's kind of a really illustrious figure

2652
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:29,078
in the industry you know um as you

2653
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:31,599
pointed out you know a lot of people

2654
01:54:29,078 --> 01:54:34,000
probably do assume he gets you know some

2655
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:35,360
kind of kickbacks from people using his

2656
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,039
stuff or just you know somehow

2657
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:39,639
intimately tied to some kind of

2658
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:41,279
financial gain from the seeds you think

2659
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:42,800
he's just more of you know a mellow guy

2660
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:47,439
like I know he used to breed is he kind

2661
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:51,039
of stopped doing that yeah so um when I

2662

got out of prison so I went in February

2663
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:56,279

keep out of the Limelight due to his uh

sticks to the glassw work is that kind

2803
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:49,519
of why he stopped breeding because I

2804
02:00:48,198 --> 02:00:52,919
know that he made things like you know

2805
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:56,480
the geel and stuff like that yeah he had

2806

2808
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:09,000
old days man like where we were just

2809
02:01:04,198 --> 02:01:12,759
having fun man and um you know the the

2810
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:15,279
the the laws and the the cops man they

2811
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:18,280
they put a they put a quick end to that

2812
02:01:15,279 --> 02:01:20,039
and like myself um if they were to come

2813
02:01:18,279 --> 02:01:21,920
through the door right now well actually

2814
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:24,560
now I'm all protected so I tell them to

2815
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:25,840
[ __ ] my dick but but like last month if

2816
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,960
they were to come through the door I was

2817
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:31,639
looking at like 15 to 20 years man and

2818
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:33,760
same same goes for him I think they got

2819
02:01:31,639 --> 02:01:36,118
medical where he's at but you know he's

2820
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,960
trying to keep it down low and yeah you

2821
02:01:36,118 --> 02:01:41,039
know just kind of mellow out and maybe

2822
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:43,399
you know when some more laws change or

2823
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:45,238
whatever you'll see him see him out and

2824
02:01:43,399 --> 02:01:48,679
about a bit more but you know he's a

2825
02:01:45,238 --> 02:01:50,479
family man know he's got his kids and

2826
02:01:48,679 --> 02:01:52,760
he's got his old lady that tries to keep

2827
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:56,238
him out of trouble and you know that

2828
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:59,159
whole deal so yeah man but real good

2829
02:01:56,238 --> 02:02:01,638
dude um like I say he's real real into

2830
02:01:59,158 --> 02:02:03,799
his glass blowing too he used to blow

2831
02:02:01,639 --> 02:02:06,719
glass on dead tour and sell them out in

2832
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:09,119
the out in the parking lot oh really so

2833
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:13,399
yeah yeah man yeah he's been doing this

2834
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:15,279
[ __ ] long time man that's really cool um

2835
02:02:13,399 --> 02:02:17,559
and so I guess my ultimate question

2836
02:02:15,279 --> 02:02:19,559
would be have you ever spoken to him

2837
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:22,960
about uh what he plans on doing with

2838
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:27,199
those remaining seeds

2839
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:28,920
oh man the the the DEA took them really

2840
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:31,439
yeah I've never read

2841
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:35,199
that yeah they're in an Evidence room

2842
02:02:31,439 --> 02:02:38,000
somewhere man um yeah yeah they they

2843
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:39,678
took them bastards but um I think this

2844
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,039
is groundbreaking I don't think this no

2845
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:44,639
one knows about this oh yeah man yeah

2846
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:47,118
that when they come and got him they got

2847
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:50,520
his seed collection as clones and all

2848
02:02:47,118 --> 02:02:52,920
but we um collectively you know we've

2849
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:56,880
kept all of our own seed breeding old

2850
02:02:52,920 --> 02:03:01,039
seeds clones and we got it all we got it

2851
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:04,159
stored away and he he's uh he's well set

2852
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:07,960
and then um plus you know the the the

2853
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:10,319
mother plant that produced these Kim dog

2854
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:11,960
seeds

2855
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:17,399
um

2856
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:20,920
yeah so all good yeah you could say that

2857
02:03:17,399 --> 02:03:23,319
so we um you know [ __ ] them you know

2858
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:25,239
they whatever take man we'll build it

2859
02:03:23,319 --> 02:03:26,920
bigger and better than we had it before

2860
02:03:25,238 --> 02:03:29,879
you know so they ain't they ain't going

2861
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:31,279
to stop [ __ ] yeah that's a huge thing I

2862
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:33,560
say to anyone as soon as they find

2863
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:36,238
something unique you need to delocalize

2864
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:38,119
it because it's just too risky to hoard

2865
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:40,678
things and you know I I always use the

2866
02:03:38,118 --> 02:03:42,279
example of uh the alien technology

2867
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:44,639
strain as much as it might have been a

2868
02:03:42,279 --> 02:03:46,679
bit of a fad you know it doesn't exist

2869
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:48,039
anymore because the guy who found it

2870
02:03:46,679 --> 02:03:49,158
didn't give any cuts out and then he

2871
02:03:48,039 --> 02:03:52,198
lost it

2872
02:03:49,158 --> 02:03:55,558
himself yeah man I know that guy too man

2873
02:03:52,198 --> 02:03:58,839
I remember when he sprouted SE yeah yeah

2874
02:03:55,559 --> 02:04:01,000
that's him um yeah I remember like

2875
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,520
they're just land race afghanis man

2876
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,920
that's all it that's all it was and he

2877
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,599
found a good boy I remember he showed me

2878
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:10,399
pictures of it when I was real little

2879
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:12,880
man had the Cod leadens and like one set

2880
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:15,679
of leaves gr out and had [ __ ] frost

2881
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:17,159
on it like a bud I was like oh [ __ ] and

2882
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,800
then that's the one he used called it

2883
02:04:17,158 --> 02:04:21,118
the alien Tech and you know it does good

2884
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,840
that's why I was saying there's a lot to

2885
02:04:21,118 --> 02:04:26,078
be said about you know you introduce

2886
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:28,840
land race to a hybrid right and you can

2887
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:32,319
you can do some pretty cool stuff man

2888
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:35,239
yeah for sure so kind of the last of the

2889
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:38,118
more extended questions uh what do you

2890
02:04:35,238 --> 02:04:40,319
think is the best way for a kind of a

2891
02:04:38,118 --> 02:04:43,198
community to grow if it's in its infancy

2892
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:45,840
so in in reference to say Australia we

2893
02:04:43,198 --> 02:04:47,439
don't really have clones that get passed

2894
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,078
around I'm sure there are people with

2895
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:50,479
high quality clones but we don't ever

2896
02:04:49,078 --> 02:04:52,359
seen really you know that's something

2897
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:53,519
we're trying to establish what do you

2898
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:55,000
think is the most important do you think

2899
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:56,480
do you think it would be trying to get

2900
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,319
you know get people to be passing

2901
02:04:56,479 --> 02:05:00,359
genetics around and from their strains

2902
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:02,039
will develop or do you think maybe try

2903
02:05:00,359 --> 02:05:03,359
to work on getting the legalization

2904
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:05,559
model and then you've got a bit more

2905
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:09,719
room to work within

2906
02:05:05,559 --> 02:05:11,599
there so what what I guess guided us

2907
02:05:09,719 --> 02:05:15,359
back in the day is like when everything

2908
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:17,400
was illegal as can be it was the passion

2909
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:19,039
and all that driving us to make

2910
02:05:17,399 --> 02:05:21,719
something better or like we find

2911
02:05:19,039 --> 02:05:24,078
something cool man we keep hold of it

2912
02:05:21,719 --> 02:05:25,880
and then like you know you meet guys you

2913
02:05:24,078 --> 02:05:28,359
know you're on Grateful Dead tour you

2914
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:30,480
know these guys a couple years they they

2915
02:05:28,359 --> 02:05:32,880
grow killer weed you grow killer weed

2916
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:35,718
you trust each other and you're like hey

2917
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:38,480
man I got this awesome roadkill Skunk

2918
02:05:35,719 --> 02:05:40,239
Man you want it you hold on to it for me

2919
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:42,198
in case something happens I can come

2920
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:44,439
back and get that back for me like yeah

2921
02:05:42,198 --> 02:05:47,118
cool well I got this really awesome

2922
02:05:44,439 --> 02:05:49,558
Afghan do you want this and absolutely

2923
02:05:47,118 --> 02:05:52,359
and that's it's like starts off as a

2924
02:05:49,559 --> 02:05:54,639
slow Network and then from from that you

2925
02:05:52,359 --> 02:05:57,198
know I might have that Afghan and then

2926
02:05:54,639 --> 02:06:00,039
call him up in a year and say hey man I

2927
02:05:57,198 --> 02:06:03,198
was [ __ ] around grew some roadkill

2928
02:06:00,039 --> 02:06:05,679
seeds and pollinated your Afghan here's

2929
02:06:03,198 --> 02:06:07,598
some seeds he grows it out finds another

2930
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:10,039
clone then he might have another buddy

2931
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:15,039
here's this clone and it really starts

2932
02:06:10,039 --> 02:06:18,359
off slow and clone trading up until I

2933
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:20,439
guess the real legalization was going on

2934
02:06:18,359 --> 02:06:22,519
like with the medical and all that it

2935
02:06:20,439 --> 02:06:25,238
won't it won't really a whole lot of

2936
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:28,199
people trading a whole lot cuz trust

2937
02:06:25,238 --> 02:06:31,359
issues and you and you didn't want to

2938
02:06:28,198 --> 02:06:33,719
like let people KN know you grow like so

2939
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:35,319
like the old forums like overgrow and

2940
02:06:33,719 --> 02:06:36,960
stuff like that you know we did a little

2941
02:06:35,319 --> 02:06:40,000
bit of trading because you could

2942
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:42,078
maintain your anonymousness a little bit

2943
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,319
you know yeah so like for the longest

2944
02:06:42,078 --> 02:06:46,319
time you know a name like Duke Diamond

2945
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:48,679
you think I probably look like a pimp

2946
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:51,840
you know what I mean gold chains and you

2947
02:06:48,679 --> 02:06:53,840
know what I mean so it was an alias I

2948
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:57,119
just trying to make the opposite of what

2949
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:59,078
I look like and who I am so you know

2950
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:01,198
like this to me like years ago this

2951
02:06:59,078 --> 02:07:03,078
would have been nuts man like nobody

2952
02:07:01,198 --> 02:07:05,879
knew my face nobody knew where I was

2953
02:07:03,078 --> 02:07:08,439
from or what I talk like or none of that

2954
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:10,359
so as the things progressed you know

2955
02:07:08,439 --> 02:07:12,678
these dispensaries open up they start

2956
02:07:10,359 --> 02:07:15,238
selling clones and you know people are

2957
02:07:12,679 --> 02:07:17,279
openly trading a little bit more it kind

2958
02:07:15,238 --> 02:07:20,678
of starts like a wildfire man it gets

2959
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:23,319
out of control quick but the problem is

2960
02:07:20,679 --> 02:07:25,199
you get a lot of uh illegitimate Cuts

2961
02:07:23,319 --> 02:07:28,198
Like a guy's like hey man I got this

2962
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:29,960
Sour Diesel right it ain't Sour Diesel

2963
02:07:28,198 --> 02:07:32,719
at all you know and but it gets passed

2964
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:35,679
around to 150 people that all swear to

2965
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:37,960
God this is sour diesel I paid $100 for

2966
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:41,559
this cutting or my buddy wouldn't lie to

2967
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:43,639
me you know that whole whole gig so I

2968
02:07:41,559 --> 02:07:46,400
would say now like in your in the

2969
02:07:43,639 --> 02:07:49,118
infancy of it over there just keep

2970
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:52,879
growing from seed find your really

2971
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:55,960
exceptional stuff and just hang on to

2972
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:58,118
them you know and um as yall get more

2973
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:00,480
and more and you get that more Community

2974
02:07:58,118 --> 02:08:03,039
thing where whether it's a forum or

2975
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:05,238
y'all are so far along to where we can

2976
02:08:03,039 --> 02:08:07,639
all go down to the park at like some

2977
02:08:05,238 --> 02:08:09,879
cannabis Rally or whatever and you meet

2978
02:08:07,639 --> 02:08:11,599
people and you know just treat it like

2979
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:13,719
you would anything else like if you grew

2980
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:15,559
tomatoes in your vegetable garden and

2981
02:08:13,719 --> 02:08:18,198
your neighbor's cool and he's into it

2982
02:08:15,559 --> 02:08:20,960
too you know hang out man and you know

2983
02:08:18,198 --> 02:08:22,919
help each other along Yeah man so

2984
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,480
basically don't shy away from giving

2985
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:25,840
people you trust things that you want to

2986
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:29,598
hang on

2987
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:32,279
to yeah like I always said it's good to

2988
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:34,199
have a good backup guy now your backup

2989
02:08:32,279 --> 02:08:37,279
guy like if you're in like the breeding

2990
02:08:34,198 --> 02:08:39,078
world you don't necessarily want to pass

2991
02:08:37,279 --> 02:08:41,198
things out because it's like giving out

2992
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:43,359
the Coca-Cola secret you don't want

2993
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:45,479
everybody to have it you know but there

2994
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:47,920
were certain things I made that man I

2995
02:08:45,479 --> 02:08:50,879
wanted everybody to have it you know so

2996
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:54,399
you know pick and choose um on kind of

2997
02:08:50,880 --> 02:09:00,480
what goes out there but I will say

2998
02:08:54,399 --> 02:09:02,359
this um people are people and um if you

2999
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:05,759
don't want something to ever get out

3000
02:09:02,359 --> 02:09:07,639
there never give it to a single soul but

3001
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:11,239
be prepared if something happens and you

3002
02:09:07,639 --> 02:09:12,960
lose it you done lost it so yeah you

3003
02:09:11,238 --> 02:09:16,078
know it's just kind of one of them deals

3004
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:18,000
too yeah for sure so uh for the last

3005
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:19,198
little part I was just uh hoping we

3006
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,399
could just do some kind of more

3007
02:09:19,198 --> 02:09:24,118
light-hearted short random questions

3008
02:09:21,399 --> 02:09:26,078
just maybe novelty interest to people um

3009
02:09:24,118 --> 02:09:30,000
so the first one is if you could go back

3010
02:09:26,078 --> 02:09:32,840
to I use pant buddy yeah conditioner

3011
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,719
it's looking good oh yeah man that's

3012
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:38,039
solid um so if you could go back to one

3013
02:09:35,719 --> 02:09:40,679
place and one time in history to get

3014
02:09:38,039 --> 02:09:42,359
some land race seeds where would you

3015
02:09:40,679 --> 02:09:46,000
pick and you know what

3016
02:09:42,359 --> 02:09:49,920
error I'd be in Afghanistan and I'd be

3017
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:52,679
in Lebanon from like the 70s man right

3018
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:55,359
before 1978 when the Russians tried to

3019
02:09:52,679 --> 02:09:57,719
invade Afghanistan I'd be all over that

3020
02:09:55,359 --> 02:09:57,719
some

3021
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:05,519
[ __ ] huh back when the hippie trial was

3022
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:08,840
open yeah man exactly and I I'd be I'd

3023
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:12,159
be rounding up stuff from there um I

3024
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:15,679
would have probably done that and uh

3025
02:10:12,158 --> 02:10:17,279
hell man uh anywhere in Thailand if I if

3026
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:19,960
I knew I won't going to get caught and

3027
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:22,439
like executed by a firing squad for

3028
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:26,520
finding some seeds I'd probably be all

3029
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:29,719
over that place um but yeah primarily

3030
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:32,760
like Lebanon Afghanistan Pakistan right

3031
02:10:29,719 --> 02:10:36,279
along that Hindu Kush mountain range

3032
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:38,159
yeah so uh next one what's uh what's the

3033
02:10:36,279 --> 02:10:40,960
worst thing to happened to the scene

3034
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:45,479
since you've been involved in it in your

3035
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:50,399

legalization happened you had a lot of

3042

02:12:02,559 --> 02:12:07,279
nothing but just [ __ ] long time ago

3064
02:12:05,158 --> 02:12:10,558
it used to be full of like a lot of good

3065
02:12:07,279 --> 02:12:12,719
grow information and good stuff and now

3066
02:12:10,559 --> 02:12:15,520
it's like what's the latest rapper

3067
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:18,118
rapping about and you know bunch of

3068
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:20,360
titties and ass and advertising you know

3069
02:12:18,118 --> 02:12:22,799
most of the magazines advertisement for

3070
02:12:20,359 --> 02:12:25,639
really shitty Seas at shitty seed banks

3071
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:27,400
that you know it's not good and then if

3072
02:12:25,639 --> 02:12:29,480
you do get a little information it's

3073
02:12:27,399 --> 02:12:31,039
buried underneath some interview with

3074
02:12:29,479 --> 02:12:33,919
some rapper who doesn't give a [ __ ]

3075
02:12:31,039 --> 02:12:35,719
about medicine or cannabis Community or

3076
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,559
whatever he's just concerned with money

3077
02:12:35,719 --> 02:12:41,279
and making songs and they glorify people

3078
02:12:38,559 --> 02:12:43,199
like that um there's like certain ones

3079
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:46,359
even they they were informants man they

3080
02:12:43,198 --> 02:12:48,399
were snitches these people were like

3081
02:12:46,359 --> 02:12:51,880
pieces of [ __ ] and they're sitting there

3082
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:53,198
glorifying this guy in a magazine

3083
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:56,639
and you know and like they they're

3084
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:57,839
killing us and they don't care about us

3085
02:12:56,639 --> 02:12:59,559
but you know they're going to they're

3086
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:01,480
going to do that because of the money so

3087
02:12:59,559 --> 02:13:03,279
the guys are really just chasing the

3088
02:13:01,479 --> 02:13:05,319
money they forgot about the passion and

3089
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:07,880
the real reason why we do what we're

3090
02:13:05,319 --> 02:13:13,000
doing you know so that's definitely a

3091
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:15,639
real bad one um and then yeah the

3092

3094
02:13:17,559 --> 02:13:23,360
going on for a while but I'd say in the

3095

for nothing and um when I was rounding

3162
02:16:41,079 --> 02:16:45,760
my clones back up he was the only guy I

3163
02:16:43,318 --> 02:16:47,519

02:18:39,159 --> 02:18:44,359
America uh the Canadians are growing it

3209
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:46,920
it was called beasto man and Beast it

3210
02:18:44,359 --> 02:18:50,120
looks like it's thick old wet nugget and

3211
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:51,840
not a damn triome on it it ain't got no

3212
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:55,040
actually does have was smell smells like

3213
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:57,079
hey and um the [ __ ] was Dirt Cheap you

3214
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:59,200
could get it like pounds for cheap sell

3215
02:18:57,079 --> 02:19:01,760
it to dumb college kids make a couple

3216
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:04,000
bucks but it was worthless weed it was

3217
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:05,519
so nasty it was so bad we even had

3218
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,840
shirts that said friends don't let

3219
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:11,398
friends smoke beasts so that one was

3220
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:13,639
pretty bad so like most of like what Cy

3221
02:19:11,398 --> 02:19:15,000
seeds grows out now it reminds me of the

3222
02:19:13,638 --> 02:19:17,638
Beast the

3223
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,558
Beast [ __ ] that [ __ ] a lot of what you

3224
02:19:17,638 --> 02:19:22,079
get commercially available in Australia

3225
02:19:19,558 --> 02:19:24,239
is pretty uh similar to the beasters

3226
02:19:22,079 --> 02:19:27,638
from what I've heard it's it's not good

3227
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:29,359
at all yeah it looks like uh very orange

3228
02:19:27,638 --> 02:19:32,558
looking hair like you got pulled about

3229
02:19:29,359 --> 02:19:35,120
two weeks too early super dense but no

3230
02:19:32,558 --> 02:19:37,759
resin smells like hey doesn't get you

3231
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:40,120
high yeah maybe one one of our big

3232
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:42,599
problems is uh the use of uh plant

3233
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:44,399
growth Regulators it's uh it's really

3234
02:19:42,599 --> 02:19:45,639
predominant and yeah it's just horrible

3235
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:48,398
for the

3236
02:19:45,638 --> 02:19:51,478
scene yeah man and the whole like the

3237
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:53,879
whole deal is man is like

3238
02:19:51,478 --> 02:19:57,438
like it it it it just starts off real

3239
02:19:53,879 --> 02:19:59,759
small like uh what was that [ __ ] uh TS

3240
02:19:57,439 --> 02:20:02,079
Elliott the [ __ ] poet you know he had

3241
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:03,920
the whole thing uh it doesn't start with

3242
02:20:02,079 --> 02:20:07,799
a bang it starts with the whimp the

3243
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:10,840
slippery SL it really is man so if you

3244
02:20:07,799 --> 02:20:14,679
get some good seeds get getting over

3245
02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:17,439
there hook y'all up man um and you get

3246
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:20,880
some you get some good uh some good grow

3247
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:22,639
technology and the best way to do it I

3248
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:25,959
used to do this with when I was doing a

3249
02:20:22,639 --> 02:20:29,159
solar panel engineering is if you learn

3250
02:20:25,959 --> 02:20:31,358
one you do one and you teach one so if

3251
02:20:29,159 --> 02:20:33,680
everybody takes that approach like you

3252
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:35,960
learn some good ass soil methodologies

3253
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:38,720
man you grow out some killer weed you

3254
02:20:35,959 --> 02:20:40,679
turn on your friend to it and say hey

3255
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:42,478
smoke this [ __ ] and when they're like

3256
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:45,159
man how'd you do that you're like hey

3257
02:20:42,478 --> 02:20:47,478
man let me show you how easy it is but

3258
02:20:45,159 --> 02:20:49,600
I'm going to show you but in return when

3259
02:20:47,478 --> 02:20:51,959
you get done chopping you need to show a

3260
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:54,760
friend and then they turn showel friend

3261
02:20:51,959 --> 02:20:57,879
and within a year you'll have a pretty

3262
02:20:54,760 --> 02:21:00,079
big organic good killer weed Market

3263
02:20:57,879 --> 02:21:02,679
going on there man that just starts with

3264
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:05,639
good genetics and you know a good good

3265
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:07,720
foundation of you know organic growing

3266
02:21:05,639 --> 02:21:10,879
skills which I mean it's really easy

3267
02:21:07,719 --> 02:21:12,760
it's not even not even that hard man I

3268
02:21:10,879 --> 02:21:14,719
you know my dumb ass can do it anybody

3269
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:16,398
can do it you know what I mean yeah I

3270
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:18,840
think that's what's surprising is like

3271
02:21:16,398 --> 02:21:21,239
how much easier organic is and yet

3272
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:22,398
somehow it's so like Hy ponic is so much

3273
02:21:21,239 --> 02:21:25,318
more

3274
02:21:22,398 --> 02:21:27,159
prevalent yeah man like I mean [ __ ] like

3275
02:21:25,318 --> 02:21:30,600
these [ __ ] PL man I think I got

3276
02:21:27,159 --> 02:21:33,559

do you guys keep

3306
02:22:50,959 --> 02:22:54,519
the genius and the princess on fairly

3307
02:22:53,398 --> 02:22:58,039
tight

3308
02:22:54,520 --> 02:23:00,079
lockdown oh yeah man absolutely like we

3309
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:02,600
never really really got that out there's

3310
02:23:00,079 --> 02:23:04,760
a couple of people that uh held on to it

3311
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:07,040
as backup but they're kind of the same

3312
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:09,478
deal they're hermit types they don't

3313
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:11,800
really associate with other other people

3314
02:23:09,478 --> 02:23:13,239
so yeah this is the princess right here

3315
02:23:11,799 --> 02:23:15,679
right beside the

3316
02:23:13,239 --> 02:23:18,039
genius it said I'm sorry they're all

3317
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:19,600
kind of hacked up from taking clones but

3318
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:21,600
I was about to say is it because of the

3319
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:23,359
Clones or do they have quite a different

3320
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:25,000
structure like the uh the princess looks

3321
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:28,559
to be you know more kind of Christmas

3322
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:31,079
tree is yeah exactly man so like that

3323
02:23:28,559 --> 02:23:34,199
just goes to show people like you can

3324
02:23:31,079 --> 02:23:36,680
take one little Jean Pool Man and man

3325
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:38,200
you could go on infinitely working that

3326
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:41,159
thing you know you don't need a million

3327
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:43,279
strains like we can work [ __ ] probably

3328
02:23:41,159 --> 02:23:46,119
50 different variants just off in one

3329
02:23:43,279 --> 02:23:48,399
plant even though like this princess and

3330
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:50,960
this genius they're sisters but they

3331
02:23:48,398 --> 02:23:54,119
grow totally different man like you said

3332
02:23:50,959 --> 02:23:56,478
Christmas tree and then that long kinky

3333
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:59,200
kinky kind of Branch thing going on you

3334
02:23:56,478 --> 02:24:02,599
know that shrub I love that shrub

3335
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:05,000
structure yeah man but yeah like and you

3336
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:07,680
know like when when one of these moms

3337
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,600
like gets too big like a Sunday we just

3338
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:12,479
took some clones off of we're going to

3339
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:14,920
retire this mom so over

3340
02:24:12,478 --> 02:24:17,719
here we got all these clones getting

3341
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:20,920
rooted bro so what'll happen is we'll

3342
02:24:17,719 --> 02:24:23,679
take the healthiest one and I'll come

3343
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:26,799
back over here you see that big ass

3344
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:29,439
trunk on that sucker man we'll chop her

3345
02:24:26,799 --> 02:24:32,119
off I'll cut a little hole out right

3346
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:34,000
here yep and I'll drop that clone right

3347
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:36,359
back in there and just give it water and

3348
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:40,040
I'll grow another one of these that's

3349
02:24:36,359 --> 02:24:42,399
same dirt same pot same everything man

3350
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:45,240
so like this that just happened not too

3351
02:24:42,398 --> 02:24:47,039
long ago with this one there's a

3352
02:24:45,239 --> 02:24:49,478
gooey

3353
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:51,840
so that's it dropped it right back into

3354
02:24:49,478 --> 02:24:54,239
the same pot yeah the gooy is a strain

3355
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:55,920
which uh not not many people seem to

3356
02:24:54,239 --> 02:24:57,680
know about her in my opinion yet it's

3357
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:59,520
certainly one which should get more

3358
02:24:57,680 --> 02:25:03,398
attention I think what's your opinions

3359
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:05,319
on her oh it's killer dude there ain't

3360
02:25:03,398 --> 02:25:08,039
nothing on Earth more pineapple than

3361
02:25:05,318 --> 02:25:11,079
that thing and it's like it's really

3362
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:12,760
killer yeah very potent gooey breeder

3363
02:25:11,079 --> 02:25:15,760
he's like he's like one of them unknown

3364
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:18,760
breeder Legends man really good dude

3365
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:20,840
knows how to do his thing and um just

3366
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:24,960
gets overlooked by people and I don't

3367
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:27,520
know why but yeah super killer man yeah

3368
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:29,199
and then uh yeah and all these just like

3369
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:31,720
I said they just went right back into

3370
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:34,120
another pot this is a strawberry diesel

3371
02:25:31,719 --> 02:25:36,920
coffin cut right here this would be like

3372
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:38,960
one of our new releases uh it's getting

3373
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:42,478
hit with Cindy 99 and we're making it's

3374
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:45,879
called the ice coffee so that be hybrid

3375
02:25:42,478 --> 02:25:48,318
coming and we'll have the sour diesel

3376
02:25:45,879 --> 02:25:51,879
Bean pole so that's how sour diesel

3377

gets those and they look like little

3379
02:25:53,318 --> 02:25:59,039
Indica plants they're full of [ __ ] so

3380
02:25:55,959 --> 02:26:01,000
yeah it's big old tall Bean pole and

3381
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:03,720
this is uh one of our

3382
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:06,398
males see how thick that is for a mail

3383
02:26:03,719 --> 02:26:09,559
man jeez that's such a beautiful

3384

structure yeah man that's our new Cindy

3385
02:26:09,559 --> 02:26:14,719
mail one out of a thousand is that the

3386
02:26:12,359 --> 02:26:17,159
one I um I saw on the Instagram which is

3387
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:19,959
the uh the kind of the genius

3388
02:26:17,159 --> 02:26:22,119
phenotype no that's uh that was another

3389
02:26:19,959 --> 02:26:24,519
one um that was our

3390
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:27,960
p75 oh yeah sorry my

3391
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:28,680
mistake yeah man oh you're all good uh

3392
02:26:27,959 --> 02:26:31,278
that

3393
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:34,040
one I said we keep them kind of hacked

3394
02:26:31,279 --> 02:26:35,720
up so they're not the prettiest but yeah

3395
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:38,680
that was that one it's kind of hard to

3396
02:26:35,719 --> 02:26:39,959
see the the whole you can see he's got

3397
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:43,639
great

3398
02:26:39,959 --> 02:26:47,639
branching Yeah man so yeah man like we

3399
02:26:43,639 --> 02:26:49,719
got we got males and males and males and

3400
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:52,398
and most people throwing them away but

3401
02:26:49,719 --> 02:26:58,039
that's another male and there's that

3402
02:26:52,398 --> 02:27:00,639
Apollo 11 Mom oh nice sa thing yeah like

3403
02:26:58,040 --> 02:27:05,279
I mean you know like if you take like a

3404
02:27:00,639 --> 02:27:08,478
a 11 it's genius and then you got uh um

3405
02:27:05,279 --> 02:27:10,800
Cinderella 99 is a male so you see this

3406
02:27:08,478 --> 02:27:12,879
plant you know see that sativa leaf and

3407
02:27:10,799 --> 02:27:15,438
everything and you've seen the buds on

3408
02:27:12,879 --> 02:27:17,478
Instagram and yep smells like rip red

3409
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:20,520
grapefruit and tastes like gummy bears

3410
02:27:17,478 --> 02:27:21,599
right so then you take over here sounds

3411
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:26,600
this is

3412
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:30,479
Apollo so this Apollo 13 this is uh uh

3413
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:35,600
p75 which is the precursor to

3414
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:38,639
c99 so it's 75% princess whereas c99 is

3415
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:40,120
94% right so that little percentile

3416
02:27:38,639 --> 02:27:42,760
difference gives you a totally different

3417
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:45,640
plant this thing smells like skunk's ass

3418
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:48,359
and mango and tastes like

3419
02:27:45,639 --> 02:27:50,840
fuel so just you know just from that

3420
02:27:48,359 --> 02:27:52,680
slight slight change man

3421
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:55,398
so it's pretty and you can see it's got

3422
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:57,398
a wider Leaf you know it's uh the little

3423
02:27:55,398 --> 02:28:00,760
bit coming through from the Shiva skunk

3424
02:27:57,398 --> 02:28:03,119
which is skunk and L5 so you know just

3425
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:05,680
off of one little change man you you end

3426
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:07,760
up with a whole lot of difference man

3427
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:10,520
yeah so when you guys um started making

3428
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:13,680
these again and you decided to reuse the

3429
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:15,960
p75 genetics for example was that

3430
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:18,000
because you kind of thought that um the

3431
02:28:15,959 --> 02:28:20,239
genetics were proven and it was worth

3432
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:22,239
using them and you know maybe you know

3433
02:28:20,239 --> 02:28:24,879
for example the uh I believe it was a

3434
02:28:22,239 --> 02:28:26,600
Shiva skunk mail Mr Soul originally used

3435
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:28,278
you know was the kind of idea that you

3436
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:30,559
know like that was a really good male it

3437
02:28:28,279 --> 02:28:32,239
was a solid foundation to work from or

3438
02:28:30,559 --> 02:28:34,199
was it more so just kind of saving some

3439
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:35,520
time thinking you know like why make p50

3440
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:37,159
again and work it out when we could just

3441
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:40,760
start from

3442
02:28:37,159 --> 02:28:44,359
p75 yeah so we know that like the p75

3443
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:47,200
generation that certain things were were

3444
02:28:44,359 --> 02:28:51,318
able to happen with that generation it

3445
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:55,560
um it tended to

3446
02:28:51,318 --> 02:28:59,639
not overd dominate the mother so much so

3447
02:28:55,559 --> 02:29:03,680
it made like more sense to use it in F1

3448
02:28:59,639 --> 02:29:07,079
outcrosses like say um you know Rosetta

3449
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:09,760
Stone for instance right we can use that

3450
02:29:07,079 --> 02:29:12,079
we had some Speedy nice you know

3451
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:14,439
influences and everything but we don't

3452
02:29:12,079 --> 02:29:16,600
like overwhelm what we're really like

3453
02:29:14,439 --> 02:29:20,359
and we like the mom that's why we're

3454
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:22,318
using her to make this F1 outcross so if

3455
02:29:20,359 --> 02:29:24,200
we like her you know we want to add like

3456
02:29:22,318 --> 02:29:26,119
some cool [ __ ] to it you know we'd like

3457
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:28,479
to improve it but we don't want to like

3458
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:31,040
overd dominate it now if we want to

3459
02:29:28,478 --> 02:29:34,760
really make something really new and

3460
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:36,600
like overdominant or you know um make

3461
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:39,840
something kind of completely different

3462
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:42,800
we use that Cinderella 99 and then that

3463
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:45,439
actually you know does its thing and the

3464
02:29:42,799 --> 02:29:47,799
main reason is just the way that p75

3465
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:49,760
passes its gene pairs along and the

3466
02:29:47,799 --> 02:29:52,920
frequencies of those Gene pairs it makes

3467
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:56,079
it like like a real good dad for making

3468
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:58,359
some unique F1 stuff but at the same

3469
02:29:56,079 --> 02:30:00,520
time kind of remaining true to mama you

3470
02:29:58,359 --> 02:30:03,000
know yeah yeah of course it makes

3471
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:05,760
perfect sense so um I mean just looking

3472
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:06,879
at the Garden I mean I'll obviously

3473
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:08,680
people will get to see when they're

3474
02:30:06,879 --> 02:30:11,719
watching this um you know the plants

3475
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:13,120
look fantastic what's kind of the the

3476
02:30:11,719 --> 02:30:14,719
biggest thing you notice when you walk

3477
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:16,399
into someone else's Garden what's you

3478
02:30:14,719 --> 02:30:17,959
know what's the big mistake most people

3479
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:21,278
seem to be doing or you know just a

3480
02:30:17,959 --> 02:30:23,959
common one you kind of come across

3481
02:30:21,279 --> 02:30:27,200
they water too much

3482
02:30:23,959 --> 02:30:28,879
overwatering um I have to admit I'm a

3483
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:32,760
bit guilty of that

3484
02:30:28,879 --> 02:30:34,959
myself yeah the overwatering um is a

3485
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:36,960
real fine line if you're doing Organics

3486
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:39,719
and you got real good microbial life

3487
02:30:36,959 --> 02:30:42,519
it's actually really hard to overwater

3488
02:30:39,719 --> 02:30:46,478
them to the degree where they're like

3489
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:48,840
adversely affected you know um if you

3490
02:30:46,478 --> 02:30:51,398
use Smart pots you know them fabric

3491
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:53,840
fabric pots yep yep yeah man those are

3492
02:30:51,398 --> 02:30:57,039
the [ __ ] you get like 30% more yield in

3493
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:58,799
them sock too man and uh you can't

3494
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,640
really overw waterer them too much like

3495
02:30:58,799 --> 02:31:03,079
they'll they'll dry out pretty good

3496
02:31:00,639 --> 02:31:06,000
because they breathe real good but um I

3497
02:31:03,079 --> 02:31:07,879
like to you know like I'll water but you

3498
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,719
know I feel them out like if I can't

3499
02:31:07,879 --> 02:31:11,599
like if I lift that pot up and you know

3500
02:31:09,719 --> 02:31:13,438
the weight in the bottom like it looks

3501
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:15,960
dry man but you can feel that weight in

3502
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:17,680
the bottom let her ride another day

3503
02:31:15,959 --> 02:31:20,719
until she's kind of whitening up a

3504
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:22,760
little bit and I like to go every two

3505
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:26,039
weeks so like let's say like that room I

3506
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:29,439
just showing y'all um you know this day

3507
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:31,640
one I watered room yesterday so like I

3508
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:35,760
mean they're good and Hefty

3509
02:31:31,639 --> 02:31:37,719
right um I'll let them get to where like

3510
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:39,439
I feel that weight in the bottom because

3511
02:31:37,719 --> 02:31:41,239
I know like those roots from the

3512
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:43,359
transplant haven't made it all the way

3513
02:31:41,239 --> 02:31:45,279
to the bottom but when I water them

3514
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:48,520
again I'm only going to water them about

3515
02:31:45,279 --> 02:31:51,159
enough to dampen up that top 2/3 again

3516
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:53,239
right just to keep the plant going and

3517
02:31:51,159 --> 02:31:55,920
then like I kind of maintain that for

3518
02:31:53,239 --> 02:31:58,159
about 2 weeks and then I let it come to

3519
02:31:55,920 --> 02:32:00,318
not totally dry but that pot's pretty

3520
02:31:58,159 --> 02:32:02,239
damn light most people are freaked out

3521
02:32:00,318 --> 02:32:04,519
but you'll notice man the the leaves

3522
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:06,879
will be up there praying just like that

3523
02:32:04,520 --> 02:32:08,800
you know um that lets you know they're

3524
02:32:06,879 --> 02:32:10,759
they're happy man so then you you know

3525
02:32:08,799 --> 02:32:13,438
you give them water and you repeat that

3526
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,439
process and then after two weeks let her

3527
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:17,720
come to a little more of a dry it helps

3528
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:20,200
to tease the roots along it allows them

3529
02:32:17,719 --> 02:32:23,760
to breathe some some real serious ious

3530
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:25,560
good breaths of oxygen and um typically

3531
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:27,639
when I let them dry out the next

3532
02:32:25,559 --> 02:32:30,159
watering I normally try to make it a

3533
02:32:27,639 --> 02:32:32,079
real healthy feed so they kind of uptake

3534
02:32:30,159 --> 02:32:34,359
a lot more and I also like to

3535
02:32:32,079 --> 02:32:36,318
reintroduce more microbes cuz like by

3536
02:32:34,359 --> 02:32:38,439
letting it dry out a little bit if I

3537
02:32:36,318 --> 02:32:40,519
lose any microbes you know by letting it

3538
02:32:38,439 --> 02:32:42,279
get a little too dry I'm putting them

3539
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:44,840
right back in so they can keep [ __ ]

3540
02:32:42,279 --> 02:32:46,399
and getting you know so um you know

3541
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:48,159
every two weeks you know you keep that

3542
02:32:46,398 --> 02:32:50,879
schedule you won't get no root rot

3543
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:54,119
problems you won't get no fungus net and

3544
02:32:50,879 --> 02:32:57,799
things like that and um actually in

3545
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:59,520
agriculture it's called crop pushing so

3546
02:32:57,799 --> 02:33:01,358
like you're kind of starving them almost

3547
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:03,600
to that little bit and then when you do

3548
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:05,479
hit them they it's like me and you man

3549
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:07,439
you starve us for a couple days and then

3550
02:33:05,478 --> 02:33:09,719
throw us in like a buffet man me and you

3551
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:11,880
going to eat so we're sick like our guts

3552
02:33:09,719 --> 02:33:14,920
are going to be all swole out like oh

3553
02:33:11,879 --> 02:33:16,398
[ __ ] they ate that much but they kind of

3554
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:18,200
do the same thing and you'll see them

3555
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:21,559
flowers start to burst and out like

3556
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:23,359
crazy man that's saying like kind of

3557
02:33:21,559 --> 02:33:25,920
with a horse in the carrot thing you

3558
02:33:23,359 --> 02:33:27,960
know like you you kind of want to

3559
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:29,639
stimulate them to do something but you

3560
02:33:27,959 --> 02:33:32,039
also kind of want to reward them with

3561
02:33:29,639 --> 02:33:37,119
what they need to respond that way with

3562
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:39,479
it you know so yeah awesome so I don't

3563
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:42,079
know if you've seen it but uh a new kind

3564
02:33:39,478 --> 02:33:44,879
of hot thing is uh vapor pressure

3565
02:33:42,079 --> 02:33:46,520
deficit um how much are you a believer

3566
02:33:44,879 --> 02:33:48,879
in this whole vapor pressure deficit if

3567
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:51,120
you've ever heard of it and uh even kind

3568
02:33:48,879 --> 02:33:53,000
of the more General question is um

3569
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:54,120
what's your kind of number one growing

3570
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,159
tip for people you know if you could

3571
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:58,079
give someone one growing tip to someone

3572
02:33:56,159 --> 02:34:00,920
who already grows you know what do you

3573
02:33:58,079 --> 02:34:03,398
think something people kind of do

3574
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:06,000
wrong um

3575
02:34:03,398 --> 02:34:08,398
overfeeding um I know it's a lot of

3576
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,680
plants man they especially ones that

3577
02:34:08,398 --> 02:34:13,239
have more of the sour fely taste they

3578
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:15,760
tend to eat less now like when they're

3579
02:34:13,239 --> 02:34:18,119
overfeeding them they think hey man the

3580
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:20,398
plant it ain't burning ain't no burn on

3581
02:34:18,120 --> 02:34:22,120
the leav so obviously

3582
02:34:20,398 --> 02:34:24,119
you know it's not too much but that's

3583
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:25,960
actually that's wrong man because

3584
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:28,920
sometimes you can feed them too much

3585
02:34:25,959 --> 02:34:30,679
they won't burn but they get complacent

3586
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:33,239
like they'll just sit there in limbo

3587
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:34,880
just not really getting any bigger so I

3588
02:34:33,239 --> 02:34:37,799
know a lot of people feed too much and

3589
02:34:34,879 --> 02:34:40,278
like this fuy strains man like I can

3590
02:34:37,799 --> 02:34:41,959
feed like if my one Buddy's doing his

3591
02:34:40,279 --> 02:34:44,560
normal thing feeding the [ __ ] out of

3592
02:34:41,959 --> 02:34:46,239
this plant I can feed a third of the

3593
02:34:44,559 --> 02:34:49,079
amount of what he's feeding it and I'll

3594
02:34:46,239 --> 02:34:51,000
yield twice as much as that sucker so

3595
02:34:49,079 --> 02:34:53,120
some plants are used to doing a whole

3596
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:54,879
lot with very little and you kind of

3597
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:56,720
look at like their Origins you know if

3598
02:34:54,879 --> 02:34:58,639
you're on the top of a mountain in

3599
02:34:56,719 --> 02:35:00,398
Afghanistan you really ain't used to

3600
02:34:58,639 --> 02:35:02,199
getting a whole lot of rain you ain't

3601
02:35:00,398 --> 02:35:04,000
used to getting a whole lot of good food

3602
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:07,120
so when you do get a little bit you can

3603
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:09,600
do a lot with it but you know too much

3604
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:12,560
man they just get complacent on you so I

3605
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:14,640
would say don't overfeed them and try

3606
02:35:12,559 --> 02:35:17,000
try different things you know and take

3607
02:35:14,639 --> 02:35:19,439
it slow like you can't you can't learn a

3608
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:21,799
strain in one growth I've grown some of

3609
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:23,880
these things 20 years and I still learn

3610
02:35:21,799 --> 02:35:26,759
new [ __ ] about them each time and

3611
02:35:23,879 --> 02:35:30,079
they're kind of like people I would

3612
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:31,880
say their language is sign language but

3613
02:35:30,079 --> 02:35:33,680
it ain't like deff people sign language

3614
02:35:31,879 --> 02:35:36,599
it's plant sign language so if you can

3615
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:39,439
learn how to speak their language you

3616
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:42,079
Leaps and Bounds ahead so you learn how

3617
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:44,398
like how do they sign that hey I need

3618
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:47,120
calcium hey I need nitrogen or hey I'm

3619
02:35:44,398 --> 02:35:49,478
happy as [ __ ] or whatever you learn

3620
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:51,040
their signs and each pl's going to be a

3621
02:35:49,478 --> 02:35:52,840
little little different and it's just

3622
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:55,520
like your close friend that you grew up

3623
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:57,239
with for 20 30 years you know when he's

3624
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,760
tired man he's got that certain look

3625
02:35:57,239 --> 02:36:00,760
about him you know when he might be

3626
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:02,239
getting a little hungry a little grumpy

3627
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:04,478
and you'll start to pick up on these

3628
02:36:02,239 --> 02:36:06,840
things with those plants so get to know

3629
02:36:04,478 --> 02:36:09,920
them just like you do any any any person

3630
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:12,200
or friend of yours or whatnot and you

3631
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:15,600
know just take it slow and try a little

3632
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:19,200
bit you know start low and work yourself

3633
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:20,800
up and then you might say okay well you

3634
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:22,439
know I got less yield this time and I

3635
02:36:20,799 --> 02:36:24,199
fed just that a little bit more let me

3636
02:36:22,439 --> 02:36:26,120
go back to where I was last time that

3637
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:28,279
was about right and play around with

3638
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:30,840
your Harvest States you know like one

3639
02:36:28,279 --> 02:36:33,960
day can make a considerable difference I

3640
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:36,318
got one strain it's got a 48 hour window

3641
02:36:33,959 --> 02:36:39,679
you're up there at like 28%

3642
02:36:36,318 --> 02:36:41,760
THC and if you miss that window by early

3643
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:46,439
a day or two or late a day or two you're

3644
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:48,680
all the way down to 20% so 9% in a 48

3645
02:36:46,439 --> 02:36:50,680
hour window so play around with that a

3646
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:52,680
little bit too like I mean the shit'll

3647
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:55,600
blow your head off if you get it right

3648
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:57,680
but it's real good either way but man

3649
02:36:55,600 --> 02:37:00,920
you hit it just

3650
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:03,880
right lord it's tough window of

3651
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:05,600
opportunity it sounds like oh man it's

3652
02:37:03,879 --> 02:37:08,079
so tough and like if you were to be

3653
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:09,840
around me working man you laugh your ass

say uh dragonfly Earth medicine uh that

3678
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:19,079

with but growing this amount at this

3683

3684
02:38:27,719 --> 02:38:32,039
