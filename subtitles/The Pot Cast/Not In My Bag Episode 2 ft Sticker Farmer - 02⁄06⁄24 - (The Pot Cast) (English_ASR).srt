00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
memes than you but your memes hit pretty

43
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,519
hard and you've definitely been someone

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,880
that

45
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,438
um inspiring

46
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,599
me what happened here this this was

47
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,279
certainly my favorite post of recent so

48
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,239
I got to give a shout

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,039
out I was like what H okay if you buy

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,319
stickers so yeah this is a funny one you

51
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,879
buy stickers are packaging for me and

52
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,438
then I got the little spelling error at

53
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,959
the end which always attracts a little

54
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,439
extra attention that's fun you got me

55
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,759
with that I was like what what just

56
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,318
popped up on the

57
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,679
screen well well played no we are we are

58
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,919
joined by meme royalty and I'm

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,879
incredibly grateful but as always let's

60
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,439
start off by asking what's everyone been

61
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,598
smoking on

62
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,840
recently uh what's in the what's in the

63
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,119
fatty you got there

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:35,120
farmer oh man this was actually given to

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:38,680
me by the boys at candies um down SoCal

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,000
which is actually a um turp line and

67
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,640
this is the weed before it's been

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,800
infused so it's topnotch man topnotch

69
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,399
high powerered

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,640
weed you'd be surprised what they're

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,680
spraying I'm curious this is good this

72
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,598
is T already taken off already going off

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,760
on a tangent with that but the the the

74
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,639
when they when those particular dudes

75
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,719
Infuse it are they infus using it with

76
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,079
weed tping from a from a different

77
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,919
strain or is it like fruit tping or do

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,560
you know okay so first of all before we

79
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,759
go into it I'll say that I don't know

80
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,239
but what I would be speaking on is like

81
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,479
what my understanding of it is and I

82
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,239
believe it's something along the lines

83
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,359
of

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,560
like The Vape juice you know yeah the

85
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,720
same stuff that they use the Vape with

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,840
and you know I'm sure the comments or

87
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,158
whatever would correct and I could be

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,479
wrong um that's definitely not my

89
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,598
specialty and I wouldn't want to speak

90
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:41,399
out of line on that subject particularly

91
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,560
right now while it's so hot but you know

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,959
um there's a bunch of flavors there's a

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,680
whole bunch of flavors in the world

94
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,560
marshmallow butterscotch Berry all these

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,280
flavors and they mix and they match all

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,239
the flavors and this is not weed flavors

97
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,000
brother this is fruit flavors this is

98
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,519
snack flavors and dessert flavors that I

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,158
know for sure and I'm sure there's

100
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,400
different levels of it like uh um I had

101
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:11,598
a buddy back in the day in the90s my

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,400
buddy Little Willie he used to make hash

103
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,680
oil and he would use this like overproof

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
lur so it was basically like really it

105
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,400
was like if you ever drank like like in

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,319
the back in the day like 100 Proof like

107
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,799
permafrost or hot damn 100 or whatever

108
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,639
it was like Blackberry lur but it was

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,280
but but it was high proof though so it

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,840
had a lot of sugar and flavor in it but

111
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,000
it also what had a lot of alcohol in it

112
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,839
so you could use it to extract weed the

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,519
way you would with regular alcohol but

114
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:45,000
where regular alcohol leaves and leaves

115
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,079
you only with whatever the resin was it

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,399
would also leave behind sugar and

117
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,120
blackberry flavor and I'm I don't know

118
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,120
what it was doing to the lungs or

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,240
whatever but we used to take it and put

120
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,759
it on rolling papers and roll joints

121
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,840
with it and when the sugar burned it was

122
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,000
delicious and it's a it was a weird

123
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,038
thing because I was like I know it's

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,720
probably not the best thing but it's

125
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,560
kind of like if you've ever like smoked

126
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,759
shisha in the hookah like hookah if you

127
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,600
smoke hookah at a hookah bar it'll be

128
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,000
like it just like tastes like strawberry

129
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,680
jam or it'll taste like whatever the

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,519
different the different shisha taste

131
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,720
like and I think it's kind of like along

132
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:26,399
that same line and my only real concern

133
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,479
always is is like you know I know like

134
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,159
straight Trappers might be like dude

135
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,800
let's just like take whatever and some

136
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,039
some you know let's just go buy some

137
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,478
[ __ ] out of the air freshener aisle and

138
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,318
put this in these pounds and I'll bet

139
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,399
they'll move and then I know there's got

140
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,560
to be other dudes too who are probably

141
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,959
like hey let's actually have like a dude

142
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,800
at a lab like our like our buddy uh

143
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,719
crybaby sent me like a kit that has all

144
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,918
these really high grade it has ketones

145
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
like there's this there's this

146
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,959
particular Ketone which is like it's

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,079
it's different to my understanding it's

148
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,959
not a tarpine but it's like it makes

149
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,240
things Tastee and smell and it smells

150
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,719
like Raspberry Vanilla it just smells

151
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,280
crazy and I'm like I know that that

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,319
would probably taste really good if you

153
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,399
put it on some weed and if it's sourced

154
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,319
really high grade then it's only a

155
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,399
matter of like you know like it's you're

156
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,759
just adding something to it but um I'm

157
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,478
always curious about that so that's why

158
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,120
I asked you because I don't you know

159
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,918
like I won't say I don't know anybody

160
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,079
who's who's infused some packs you know

161
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,240
but I I don't really know like the

162
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,839
detail of how it's how it's really done

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,120
and so I was curious about it but it's

164
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:40,799
it's a very it's a professional process

165
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,038
this is not a garage process whatsoever

166
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,000
this is medical grade devices that are

167
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,959
doing it people have showed these

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,199
machines online they resemble something

169
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,839
like a refrigerator and they have

170
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,960
shelves and they they put the thing in

171
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,839
so you know I think at first I even

172
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,318
myself just pictured some homies in the

173
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,598
garage just getting busy with some

174
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,080
whatever uh there's a little more to it

175
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:07,399
this stuff that is being put on the weed

176
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,159
is already intended to be smoked I

177
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,478
believe um

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,560
so you know we do the flavored blunts we

179
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,000
do the peach optimos and the grape

180
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,680
swishers and the peaches and cream and

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,399
all this these tobacco Blended flavors

182
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,038
it's the same thing it's very oily you

183
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,399
can kind of like when you even when you

184
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,079
smell it you can tell it's oily I bet it

185
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,878
has a different texture when you touch

186
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,478
the tree I've only come in

187
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,319
contact with weed that I know was

188
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:42,159
infused one time I'm in California I go

189
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,240
up and down the state I see all types of

190
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,560
people that are you know heavily

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,360
involved in all types of different

192
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,839
things I've only come into contact with

193
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,720
it one time so in California I can tell

194
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:56,000
you it's not very popular it's not

195
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
everywhere the people that work for me

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,560
for example when I show it to them

197
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,599
they're they're like surprised cuz like

198
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,680
like we're not seeing this stuff out

199
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,560
here in California yeah um this is a

200
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,038
different

201
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,199
demographic it's it's interesting how

202
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,560
much it seems to have taken over the

203
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,038
East Coast predominantly and just as a

204
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,240
side note I noticed there's now a

205
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,360
podcast dedicated to just rating sprayed

206
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,478
packs which I think is a good indicator

207
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,598
of like how prevalent it's becoming I

208
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,120
guess the question I'd love to quickly

209
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,478
throw out there is do you think that

210
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,918
it's almost certain at this point that

211
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:30,639
it's just going to become the next most

212
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:34,240
dominant or do you think it'll have its

213
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:38,120
rise and fall off it already

214
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,080
is it already is it's there so it's it's

215
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,799
there whether people want to accept that

216
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,519
or not um I have a bird's eyee view of

217
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,479
the industry I happen to know a whole

218
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,959
bunch of different things so it's like I

219
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360
could tell what's going on I could tell

220
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,879
what's popular I could see it when it's

221
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
coming I could see it when it's going

222
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,958
right now I'd say we're you

223
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,040
know we're it's still going up how about

224
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,958
that you know um it's still has some

225
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:06,000
growth in it I saw the whole runs

226
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,439
movement I saw how long that lasted I

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,240
saw the explosion of carts a few years

228
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,360
ago I saw how long that lasted so I do

229
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,360
have a few other things to compare this

230
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
wave

231
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,159
to however

232
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,959
um have not seen the money move like it

233
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,000
does you know shout out to Dom's dooes

234
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:29,919
shout out to Young Jack shout out to OJ

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,919
and the white Bronco nation

236
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,759
I love it I love it you can't you can't

237
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,838
beat some of this stuff and God we we've

238
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,519
got to pick your brain a bit because

239
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,839
that's exactly what me and I were

240
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,480
talking about a bit earlier you know

241
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,040
this guy has a bird's eye view of the

242
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,399
industry um just before we move on you

243
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,519
just mentioned you know you got an idea

244
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,679
of the next up and coming Trends what

245
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,039
what do you think might be the next

246
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,519
thing or do you think it'll be another

247
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,519
interation of something we already

248
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,479
have um you know let's start at the

249
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,639
beginning I would say the first real

250
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,759
branding way

251
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,759
you know let's let's get ahead of dime

252
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,200
bags let's get ahead of Ziploc bags

253
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:11,120
let's get to branding that came in glass

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,680
jars that was uh you know for me lemon

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,519
tree Golden State banana stuff's coming

256
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,239
out of Santa Cruz the jar thing exploded

257
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,759
pretty quick that switched over to those

258
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,759
little tins little tin cans um that got

259
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,039
very popular for a

260
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,078
while um tin cans turned into sticker

261
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,879
bags

262
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,479
B sticker bags turned into directly

263
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,919
printed

264
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,159
bags directly printed bags turned into

265
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,719
die cut

266
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:46,958
bags um D cut

267
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,959
bags go into a box and then we Circle

268
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,799
back to double-sided sticker bags which

269
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,479
is the current humongous wave right now

270
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,599
which is great for sticker farmer

271
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,720
because we're built for this um we kind

272
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,320
of are the first ones to do the sticker

273
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,120
bag wave

274
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,680
so

275
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,078
uh that made it good for us when it

276
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,679
became popular again because I already

277
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,078
had the infrastructure to um to work off

278
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:15,120
of it uh the next

279
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,559
thing if I knew I'd be rich already I

280
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,000
could tell you that I think the

281
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:25,039
packaging is going to get more

282
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,039
complex um I think

283
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,078
the uh the layers and the levels that

284
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,679
they're doing the packaging you're

285
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,120
seeing right now like I'm working on

286
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,879
projects right

287
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,919
now to sell 1

288
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,958
18 127

289
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:47,278
pieces oh I don't know what that sound

290
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:50,958
was but um 127 pieces to sell 1

291
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,919
18 wow I'm talking box bags like

292
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:57,119
everything you could

293
00:11:52,919 --> 00:12:00,599
imagine to sell 1 18 like that's [ __ ]

294
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,440
crazy so um the L this shit's going to

295
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,920
is is like we don't even know yet New

296
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,839
York right now the New York demographic

297
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,399
is

298
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,440
controlling what everyone kind of has to

299
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,839
do there's definitely some very

300
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,880
influential Trappers on the East Coast

301
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,199
who are having a heavy hand in that and

302
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:23,000
then uh obviously the customer decides

303
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:25,679
what what's hot and what's

304
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,078
not wow that's that's what an incredible

305
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,359
little anthology of the evolving of it

306
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,319
all and I I forgot about the Tuna the

307
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,320
Tuna tins thank you for reminding me

308
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,040
they were they were certainly a a big

309
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,600
part in it all and you know what we're

310
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:39,120
going to touch back on that a bit later

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,159
in the episode but why don't we jump

312
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,919
into our first story which is everyone's

313
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:48,039
been talking about it but um you know

314
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:50,198
DEA has uh recently announced that they

315
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:52,879
and the Department of Justice plan to

316
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,838
reschedule cannabis to a schedule 3 drug

317
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,799
this signifies that they believe it's a

318
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,760
low-risk substance and it's in line with

319
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,399
other medications such as Tylenol with

320
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,958
Cod in it they say the reschedule is

321
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,000
likely going to take a couple months to

322
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,439
complete the process but it certainly is

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,799
Paving the way for what many speculators

324
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,160
suggest will be one step closer to

325
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,879
Federal legalization and at the bare

326
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,439
minimum you can sort of feel like the

327
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,799
War on Drugs is almost an an end what do

328
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,320
you guys think about the rescheduling do

329
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,639
you think this is going to usher in a

330
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,519
new wave of cannabis as people hope or

331
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,278
do you think to an extent it's still

332
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,278
same old same

333
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,120
old yeah what are you you hearing about

334
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:37,399
it are you talking um yeah what am I

335
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,919
hearing it's like it's hard because you

336
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,440
hear these things every two or three

337
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,278
weeks to say oh so and so agrees to this

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,800
or this group agrees to this and now

339
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,838
this group agrees to this so it's like

340
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,439
the marketing's cool they're making us

341
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,279
feel like something's coming you know

342
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:59,440
but um you know what that is it's it's

343
00:13:53,278 --> 00:14:01,320
really hard really hard to tell uh I see

344
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,920
I say naturally the Cannabis industry

345
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,800
people want to be excited about it

346
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:09,120
because it sounds good to have 50 states

347
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:11,399
that play ball right um but just like we

348
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,480
saw in the last few years it's not

349
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,799
always good for everyone regulation's

350
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,320
bad for

351
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,399
everybody not everybody but grad it's

352
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,320
pretty bad for most people especially

353
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,120
the mom and pop small farms things like

354
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,639
that the heavy

355
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,120
taxation that's that's coming and that's

356
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,360
inevitable because we're in Industry you

357
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,919
they're not going to just have an

358
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,759
industry that just gets to have a

359
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,799
freefor all and do whatever the [ __ ] it

360
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,320
wants that doesn't make sense um so you

361
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,919
know if we want to be part of the banks

362
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,720
if we want to be part of all these other

363
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,039
things that we're kind of like like

364
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,519
pushing the side on then you got to be

365
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,879
part of the taxes you got to be part of

366
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,198
the regulation uh the government's

367
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,439
definitely going to have their own heavy

368
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,919
hand in it so to me is it fair I don't

369
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,759
think is the question I think the

370
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,719
question is is it natural progression

371
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,360
for an industry

372
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,759
um and to me it seems like that's what's

373
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,560
supposed to be

374
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,360
happening

375
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,278
um I do say I do think there's going to

376
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,199
be some things about it that do

377
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:18,278
affect the smaller Farms that you know

378
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,319
in in particular are in California

379
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:21,720
because these are people that I'm

380
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,480
friends with and things like that and I

381
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,639
would hate to see them lose their

382
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,839
license or something like that because

383
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,440
now all of a sudden you have to be

384
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,560
federally regulated so but those are the

385
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
things that we're yet to see and we

386
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,719
don't know about

387
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,639
it there was a comment on Instagram and

388
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,240
I think what I really ultimately said

389
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,399
was that I hope it creates

390
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,120
opportunity and um however people want

391
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,919
to take

392
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,720
that yeah I think uh I think like all

393
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,639
everything you said is true it's like a

394
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,319
matter

395
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:58,600
of I mean you know like it's real easy

396
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:01,078
to go oh it should be like this and you

397
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,440
can always do that with like you know I

398
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:07,039
got a a kid and you know it's like

399
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,720
always it's always like trying to tell

400
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,078
like yeah I mean that would be cool but

401
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,720
that's not how things are like you know

402
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,719
people say well this isn't fair it's

403
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,240
like I don't really know many things

404
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,440
that are that fair you know it's things

405
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,959
are fair to an extent but um there's

406
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,240
very few of them you know so it's like

407
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,958
you're always going to have the the uh

408
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,318
you know like you said it's if it's

409
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,879
going to be an industry and it's going

410
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:35,159
to be a business you're naturally going

411
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,318
to go towards that stuff me I've always

412
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:40,480
been like yeah everybody [ __ ] up

413
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:45,198
having it be

414
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,839
mainstream but at the same time like you

415
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,958
know it it was bound to be mainstream it

416
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,120
was only some weird little events that

417
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,239
kept it uh being what it was and I think

418
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,639
like the the what it really comes down

419
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,318
to is like if you really want to have

420
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,560
some weed um and you don't want any of

421
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:05,720
the any of the other stuff attached to

422
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,159
it like just grow your own weed have

423
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:13,519
your own weed trade it with people you

424
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,640
know um and uh you know like try to try

425
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,480
to be cool about it don't tell everybody

426
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,120
you're growing and everything if it

427
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,959
comes down to being like overly

428
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,719
regulated where it goes back to being

429
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,120
basically illegal for the average

430
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,838
citizen again you know it's like all

431
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,839
right well keep it on the under you know

432
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:34,000
like don't don't just you know you can't

433
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:37,199
you you can't be like uh this is kind of

434
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,200
funny but I remember there was a

435
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,480
uh there was a time when I was getting

436
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,640
really really high and we were we were

437
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,360
actually doing nitrous and I kind of

438
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,240
like Snapped out for a second and then I

439
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,678
came back and I had this weird thing and

440
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,880
I was like oh damn I was like there's

441
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,080
like this thing where you can be way

442
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,440
down here and you're all good and you

443
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,319
can be way up

444
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,640
here and you're all good but if you're

445
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,599
right in here in the middle they're gon

446
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,240
to [ __ ] you and I like I kind of like

447
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,678
kind of like came back to Consciousness

448
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,640
saying it and everybody was like what

449
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,280
the [ __ ] are you talking about and I'm

450
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,880
like I don't really know but it was so

451
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,480
clear I just knew it was like and now

452
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,679
over the years I've kind of realized

453
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
it's like that it's like if you you know

454
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,360
there's going to be the people who are

455
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,679
really big and they'll be okay and

456
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,119
there's going to be the people who are

457
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,280
really little and they'll be okay but if

458
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,000
you're in the middle then you kind of

459
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,558
have to you're going to have to kind of

460
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,480
get up there or down there and either

461
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:39,158
get really organized and figure out what

462
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,640
people are doing at a level higher than

463
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,520
you or go ahead and go okay I'm content

464
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,320
to stay at this lower level where it's

465
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,798
not um where it's not as big of a thing

466
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:51,639
you know and I think with this kind of a

467
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,158
thing depending on how they interpret

468
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,799
the law it could make it to where like a

469
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,880
lot of our friends and people who are

470
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:01,079
not super ambitious and don't have the

471
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,320
most resources they'll have to just kind

472
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:07,158
of be you know small time and keep it

473
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,839
that way and then the people who really

474
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,039
um which are also some of our friends

475
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,439
who have more ambition and want to

476
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,359
really like push and get big like you

477
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,640
said maybe it'll be more opportunity for

478
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:21,639
them because now it is banking it is

479
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,919
maybe federal International all these

480
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,400
opportunities for everything to grow and

481
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,799
actually like Blossom like that but um

482
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,440
it would be really cool if if it um kind

483
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:36,158
of allows everything to go as it's been

484
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,600
and maybe over time they give a little

485
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:42,159
bit of of of extra power to the

486
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:46,439
localities like okay to go okay like if

487
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:48,520
you're you know um once it's more fully

488
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,120
regulated that might also mean that

489
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,879
there's some areas where that regulation

490
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,359
is less you know to where like they

491
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,360
might go hey look people have been

492
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:01,798
growing in NorCal and wherever Santa

493
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,199
Cruz or whatever for this long we're

494
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,918
going to go ahead and and ease things up

495
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,798
in those areas and make like an

496
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,200
available permit for small farms or

497
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,759
something if that could get lobbied for

498
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,720
and changed that'd be cool but um you

499
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,319
know in the meantime I think it's going

500
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,120
to be like uh like you said we you don't

501
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,439
really know but you kind of have to

502
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,798
expect that it's going to get more and

503
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,159
more complicated and you're going to

504
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:27,599
have to be more and more professional if

505
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,320
you do want to be way up on that level

506
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,480
than than right now because right now

507
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,158
people can as long as they bust their

508
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,919
ass and they jump through some hoops

509
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,520
they can get pretty high right now but

510
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,759
if they change it to where you need to

511
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:42,200
get every product cleared by the FDA and

512
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,960
you have to go through this process to

513
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,759
it could cut you know it could could

514
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,798
change that way too but it's a Trippy

515
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,759
it's a Trippy thing that's like I don't

516
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,839
think anybody can call it and uh you

517
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,079
know like you said hopefully it's good

518
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,000
for some people you

519
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,158
know yeah 100% as you said it's a bit

520
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,359
ambiguous

521
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,840
got to give a shout out to the nitrous

522
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,439
Epiphany you just described that sounds

523
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,839
epic I love it yeah you you've I've had

524
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,919
some of those ones where like you eat

525
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:12,439
some shrooms and you're like ah I I need

526
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,840
a notepad because I know this is

527
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,240
actually I just figured some crazy [ __ ]

528
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,720
out and then like you sober up and

529
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,599
you're like I don't know what it was I

530
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,038
know there was a thing or like you wake

531
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,319
up from a dream and you go I've got to

532
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,278
remember that and it's like and it's

533
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:27,839
gone this was one of the few that I

534
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:29,200
really remembered and for some reason it

535
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,359
like it didn't

536
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,759
it really didn't make much sense then

537
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,519
except at the time I was thinking of the

538
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,038
same thing I was actually thinking about

539
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,038
like big fish and little fish and it's

540
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,798
like people either have to be like if

541
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:45,200
you're a shark you're cool and if you're

542
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:47,558
a minnow you're cool but like you know

543
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,038
the the tuna is getting fished out like

544
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:54,119
there's just not you know it's a

545
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,558
trip 100% I I really enjoy that analogy

546
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,479
actually and um I mean we're while we're

547
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,798
on the topic you know if the

548
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,200
rescheduling um there's been a lot of

549
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:04,480
focal discussion regarding what does

550
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,319
this mean in terms of some of the

551
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,558
Cannabis patents that we've seen over

552
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,359
time and notably we do see the

553
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,558
pharmaceutical companies moving in

554
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:15,119
there's already several big ones

555
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,759
launching patent applications sopi mer

556
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,798
GW Pharmaceutical fisa all of these

557
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,558
companies have launched between 25 and

558
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:25,240
50 patent applications or have been

559
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,000
granted them many of these companies

560
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,359
have also been implicated or at least

561
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,599
played an adjunct role in the opioid

562
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,639
epidemic do we have any concerns about

563
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,480
the uh the rapid rise in companies

564
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,960
launching these patents in the wake of

565
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,960
what seems like possible future

566
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,519
legalization yeah I mean the weirdest

567
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
ones are when they when you read the

568
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,519
patents and they're like we have a

569
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:53,000
patent for cannabis that produces one:1

570
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,879
ratio CBD to THC or something you're

571
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,798
like that's how is that it's not really

572
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:03,080
like novel um I think what they might

573
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,759
have to do which is unfortunate is to

574
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,038
patent things to really get them to go

575
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,440
through they might have to actually

576
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:10,119
modify them and go okay you can tell

577
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,798
this is ours because it's basically got

578
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:15,479
our stamp in the DNA you can just test

579
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,240
it and be like boom it's MK boom it's

580
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,000
fizer or whatever like as soon as it

581
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,798
comes back from the DNA test it's like

582
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,880
yeah that's that one is ours you know

583
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:28,558
but um it is it would be really weird

584
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
now if they started graning all the

585
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,038
these weird ones like where they're like

586
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,240
uh it turns purple and it it smells like

587
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,000
such and such or whatever because there

588
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,679
were some weird ones filed like that and

589
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,359
everyone was like you can't they won't

590
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,320
push any of them through yet in the US

591
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,158
but if they do start and they push some

592
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:49,558
of those through it takes a lot of money

593
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,840
to get them pushed through and it takes

594
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:54,519
a lot of money to fight against them and

595
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:58,038
there's not a lot of people who are

596
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:00,000
going to want to spend tons of money to

597
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,960
make sure that other people can't get

598
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,240
those patents so you're it's kind of

599
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,558
like it could be kind of it could be

600
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,240
kind of weird and that could be a big

601
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,639
driver of that thing that I was saying

602
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,519
where like you might have to either be

603
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,360
GW Pharma or you might have to have a

604
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,038
backpack and sell sacks you know in

605
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,839
which case I think people could sell

606
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:24,319
Sachs and still be okay you know but

607
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:26,199
you're not going to be like GW Pharma Jr

608
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,918
because you're not I don't know how

609
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,440
you're G to get there you know but it

610
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,840
it'll be interesting to see it's just

611
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,840
the same how's that going to play out

612
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,119
you

613
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,879
know and either way your all your

614
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,479
sticker needs can be filled by sticker

615
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,399
farmer whether you're a backpack boy or

616
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,720
GW farmer yes legal in every state

617
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:50,678
International that's part of it for us

618
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,240
is um some of the challenging things for

619
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,919
your traditional cannabis businesses or

620
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,960
bonuses for

621
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,840
mine that's part of it when they change

622
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,360
regulation and they need to upgrade all

623
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,480
their packaging they call me I didn't

624
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:10,439
create the regulation I just sell what

625
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,519
they need to be in compliance you know

626
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,880
so it's it's part of one of those things

627
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,000
where sometimes I may see something I

628
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,320
may want to celebrate and it's insulting

629
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,278
to a mom and pop who's taking a big hit

630
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,839
like I [ __ ] get it dude but um you

631
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,119
know we're we're kind of like fishing

632
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,439
for different

633
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:31,439
things and uh you you know sometimes my

634
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,919
fish bite and sometimes your fish bite

635
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,960
it's just part of part of the business

636
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,120
and you know part of selling the pic and

637
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,960
shovels yeah and it's like I said you

638
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,119
know people like oh well that's not fair

639
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,840
like yeah that's life's not fair you you

640
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,839
bet on this horse or you bet on that

641
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,038
horse like at a time when everybody

642
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,398
thought you were nuts probably for going

643
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,038
oh stickers you know I understood

644
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,079
because I had seen like even hippies

645
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,960
when I was a little kid go oh I'm GNA

646
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,480
put this sticker on a jar and I'm going

647
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,000
to have like a mason jar with weed in it

648
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,240
and I'm going to people are going to buy

649
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,679
my ounces for 500 because it's going to

650
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,240
be just like three buds in a mason jar

651
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,798
and I got my sticker and it's super

652
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,720
simple stuff but people did it and when

653
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:16,038
they did it you looked at it you go whoa

654
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,278
that's cool but nobody wanted to do it

655
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:22,000
because when it was completely illegal

656
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,919
100% all that is is your fingerprint on

657
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,398
the jar so somebody goes oh I'm gonna

658
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,919
make this and I'm going to put this

659
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,798
stamp on it I'm going to do this they're

660
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,960
like

661
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,000
now everybody knows what that is it can

662
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,278
all be tracked back to somebody so

663
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,960
before like 2:15 people didn't really

664
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,880
want to do it and then people started to

665
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,278
do go oh you know what I'm gonna get a

666
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,640
roll of stickers made and I'm gonna

667
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:44,640
stick them on my turkey bags or whatever

668
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,759
and then you know you guys started

669
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,960
making like actually real packaging and

670
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,879
then like you said earlier following

671
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,079
like okay like because I the first

672
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,240
packaging that I got from you guys and

673
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:03,359
the only packaging that I ever got for

674
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,960
for legal wreck flour was Flats of of

675
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,558
jars that were like eighth jars and you

676
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,399
could put like a quarter in them or you

677
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,879
could put a eighth in them and they were

678
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:13,319
nice they were nice little jars they

679
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,919
were like the bottom of this basically

680
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,240
and uh nice labeling and I had my flats

681
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,759
and all my stuff and I went to take

682
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,200
those to the emerald cup and sell them

683
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,599
at a booth and I was like damn this

684
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,600
dolly with like five lbs of wheed on it

685
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,639
it weighs like 100 lb or it weighs like

686
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,719
whatever it was it was a lot it weighed

687
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,120
a lot and so as soon as I saw that I was

688
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,679
like yeah people aren't going to want to

689
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:41,199
do jars and then I saw why people wanted

690
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,360
to do tin and then everybody's like oh I

691
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,200
want my weed everybody now that's like

692
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:47,719
stuck with the old thing like I was

693
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,919
talking about oh the Mason jar with the

694
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,038
three buds that all sounds cool until

695
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,679
you actually go to go through the

696
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:56,240
logistics of the shipping and all the

697
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,320
stuff and that's one of the things I've

698
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,278
heard before about packaging with glass

699
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,798
was back in the day people would go oh

700
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:07,000
put everything in glass it's recyclable

701
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:08,679
and it's like yeah it is but a lot of

702
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,880
times it doesn't get recycled it gets

703
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,000
thrown in the trash and to ship it it

704
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,519
uses so much more fuel that it's

705
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,440
actually a crazy resource expense just

706
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,960
on our just on the world's resources up

707
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,399
a lot of resources to go I'm gonna put

708
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,440
it in glass you know 35 pounds 35 pounds

709
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:32,119
it's around 30 depending on which jar

710
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,399
you have which lid you have so you're

711
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,439
you're it's a logistical [ __ ]

712
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,278
nightmare yes it doesn't make sense but

713
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,278
when you're talking about a high quality

714
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,200
product you might want to transport it

715
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,919
in a high quality container so I still

716
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,319
think some of the best weeds in jars

717
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,799
just like the best tequila is in a

718
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:55,158
bottle and all of those fees are easily

719
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,119
absorbed at the top of food chain not

720
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,399
everyone can afford to do that you know

721
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,439
it's not for every one I do not

722
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:03,839
recommend it unless you're built for it

723
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,000
yeah it was one of those things where

724
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,918
like for me I knew for what I was doing

725
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,519
I was like I can put it in jars I

726
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,519
already had the option at the time put

727
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,079
it in bags put it in jars I was like no

728
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,919
I want to put mine in jars it's going to

729
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,879
be nice you open up the jar you can see

730
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,080
it through the jar you know what's going

731
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,519
on and um and had I continued to get

732
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,839
keep getting stuff I might have just

733
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,558
kept on getting it in jars but I also

734
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:31,798
saw that I was like damn like this is

735
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,278
just it it s the way it sounds in your

736
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:34,839
head and the way it really is when

737
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,679
you're actually holding on to them

738
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:42,480
you're like oh okay it's like I get um I

739
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:45,960
get uh seed packaging from you guys and

740
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,679
I was like maybe I'm gonna do tins maybe

741
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,880
I'll do like like it would be cool to do

742
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,679
like mini cigar boxes with the lid that

743
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,399
flips up and you know like you guys

744
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:57,360
could get me whatever I want to get and

745
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:58,879
like it's it's like you guys are the

746
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,158
homies so it's really easy to work

747
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,600
through design process do all this stuff

748
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,799
and then uh and then I I you know I like

749
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:09,398
to support people that I know or people

750
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,639
who I at least know are like Grassroots

751
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:15,918
you know smaller businesses came from

752
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,919
the weed stuff and um it I just looked

753
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,240
at it and I was like H I don't really

754
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,240
want to use plastic because I don't

755
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,720
really like having the waste of

756
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,319
plastic and uh I you know I looked at

757
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,519
all the different stuff and all said and

758
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:33,678
done I'm like I get people's packaging

759
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,359
and it's big and it takes up all this

760
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,519
space and like with seeds I take them

761
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,918
all and I put them in my fridge so I get

762
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,399
people's packaging in these nice boxes

763
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,640
or whatever they come in and I take it

764
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:48,239
and I put it in a little plastic bag and

765
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,120
I put those all in these airtight tubs

766
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,599
and so people make this really nice uh

767
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,879
packaging and then I get the seeds and

768
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm like I can't it doesn't work so I

769
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,120
went okay I'm just gonna with my seeds

770
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,398
I'm just going to go ahead and put them

771
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:06,239
straight in the in the little in the

772
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,119
little direct printed uh myars you know

773
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,200
which was which was awesome for me but

774
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,839
it's just a trip like the

775
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,120
uh you know when you go to when you go

776
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,359
to do things like you actually you

777
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:21,119
actually get your hands on it and you go

778
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:23,678
oh okay so this happens and that happens

779
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,558
and I had seeds and I did little little

780
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,200
paper folds with a little Ziploc inside

781
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,278
and I went okay now this has to be put

782
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,759
in an airtight container and now I need

783
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,038
to figure out okay something needs to be

784
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,519
Crush proof and all this stuff and it

785
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:40,000
you know it's all it's all a Trippy

786
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,480
process figuring out all the logistics

787
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,038
for all that stuff you know yeah it's

788
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,480
fun though everybody's got different

789
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,839
stuff going on and it's definitely part

790
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,120
of what uh makes it

791
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:53,439
interesting yeah for

792
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,959
sure definitely the packaging game

793
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,159
itself Spurs its own sort of creativity

794
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,798
but in in your answer you referenced you

795
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,159
know sort of the Homegrown um original

796
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,119
sort of packaging and I mean while we're

797
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,720
on the topic of Grassroots I wanted to

798
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:14,239
quickly mention uh last month 420 the

799
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,519
famous 420 event at uh Golden State Park

800
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,880
was called hippie Hill sadly didn't go

801
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,359
ahead uh this was due to the organizers

802
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,440
being unable to secure enough

803
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,479
sponsorships they cited other problems

804
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,840
as well such as the city having cutbacks

805
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,558
which meant that they weren't able to

806
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,558
secure funding to be able to run the

807
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,638
event safely in terms of say police

808
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,960
medical staff and other utilities now

809
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:36,319
some have been critical of this saying

810
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,038
that the event really doesn't need that

811
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,879
much infrastructure to run and the

812
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:43,158
vendors were still Keen to go um however

813
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,600
there was a response from the organizers

814
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:46,799
which said look last year there was

815
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:49,038
40,000 people in a relatively small

816
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,879
space uh without the appropriate funding

817
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,638
we we're just going to trash the place

818
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,480
and in fact in 2019 there was sadly some

819
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,359
fenal laced brownies that went around

820
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,000
and 10 people overdosed within the first

821
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,519
hour so so the the presence of medical

822
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,960
personnel seems like it would be highly

823
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,480
advantageous my question though is what

824
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,880
does this say for the Homegrown events

825
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,798
and as a extension do we think that

826
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,880
decriminalization and possible

827
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:15,480
legalization is sort of going to

828
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,039
actually be problematic in a sense

829
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,200
because it seems like the event

830
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,879
organizers sort of attributed the fact

831
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,038
that there was so much interest in the

832
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,480
event that they weren't able to safely

833
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,079
facilitate the event going forward do we

834
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,919
think this could be a bad sign for some

835
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:33,158
of the more organic

836
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,200
events um I'll answer that from my point

837
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:38,559
of view not everything is meant to be

838
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,798
monetized um some things are better just

839
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:44,000
left organic and left alone it was cool

840
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:45,879
when the hippies were out there just I

841
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,839
have friends that used to go out they

842
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,440
they'd spend two three days making

843
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:53,480
cookies and go out and everybody just

844
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,558
sell it's like it didn't need fences it

845
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,679
didn't need stages it probably did need

846
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:03,079
bathrooms and and um Waste Management to

847
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,240
some extent which the city should be

848
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:08,799
happy to provide when people are you

849
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,119
know Gathering um peacefully like

850
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,440
[Music]

851
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:15,399
that I don't know it's a huge part of

852
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,960
the culture in San Francisco and the

853
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:23,159
point when they tried to monetize

854
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,320
it didn't sit well with me

855
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,079
personally yeah things like that I mean

856
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,079
it was just kind of a cool a cool part I

857
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,800
mean I

858
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:35,919
think I don't know if if people are if

859
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,639
people are doing it people are going

860
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,358
it's like you know if if you really like

861
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,960
you said the one thing that I can think

862
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:44,519
like where you need money for it would

863
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
be like yeah okay where's everybody

864
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,440
gonna go to the bathroom that's like the

865
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,119
main thing that always is with a big big

866
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,039
event like you're gonna have to have

867
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,160
some rows of portapotty somewhere or

868
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,960
something but other than that it's like

869
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:02,559
all of it you know seems like you should

870
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,358
be able to just do it and then you know

871
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,759
people who want to take part in it

872
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:09,519
should be able to keep it all cool like

873
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,960
you should be able to be cleaned up at

874
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,679
the end you have a party usually a lot

875
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,159
of people come to the party I mean like

876
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,679
a small party like a house party

877
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:17,960
everybody comes everybody leaves but

878
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,159
there's always like those two or three

879
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,079
homies that are like you know what we'

880
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,159
cleaned everything up we've vacuumed

881
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,440
everything up people stayed late people

882
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:30,399
whatever and um I don't know it's always

883
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,800
weird to me to see like I remember

884
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,480
seeing when they did one of the High

885
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Times cup there and it was like

886
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,599
everything was done and over and there

887
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,960
was nobody there anymore and there was

888
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,599
still you could look around there was

889
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:48,358
still like 20 dumpsters of laying out on

890
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,480
the field wherever it was and I was like

891
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:54,318
this is wild like who who the [ __ ] does

892
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,440
this you know because people suck bro

893
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,318
people suck that's part of it too so

894
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,519
yeah for the people to the promoters who

895
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,318
did try to organize it and clean it up

896
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,719
like shout out to them yeah but

897
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:09,279
unfortunately people are not cool enough

898
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,358
and things that big need to be like

899
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,200
sanctioned to some extent or whatever

900
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,000
the word is yeah and if if you know it's

901
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:19,318
going to go on you need to kind of be

902
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,400
like all right we got a crew that's

903
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:24,960
going to be we got you know whatever

904
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:28,119
garbage crew recycling crew you know

905
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,639
like it it's just I if you are if it's

906
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,200
organized in any sense of course if

907
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,679
everyone just shows up then it's like

908
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,799
well who's whose job is it but I mean

909
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,879
back in the day honestly especially at a

910
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,119
place called hippie Hill if you had

911
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,720
hippies and you had weed people and you

912
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,440
know whatever kind of people coming out

913
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:48,358
to things like that there would be like

914
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,760
stuff would be I mean I grew up where

915
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,400
we'd have like big um when I was a

916
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,119
little kid like big like full moon

917
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,280
parties at the river and it would be

918
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,000
like there's like food and a lot of

919
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,839
people don't bring food but a lot of

920
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,960
people bring more food than they need

921
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:04,480
and a lot of people don't clean [ __ ] up

922
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,440
but you got those few people that are

923
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,920
like that's cool it's cool for everybody

924
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,760
to be able to just come and do their

925
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,960
thing don't have to worry about food

926
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,000
don't have to worry about cleanup we'll

927
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,838
do that that's like what that's going to

928
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,358
be our part of it maybe somebody comes

929
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,920
and does some music or people do

930
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:23,039
whatever but like I don't know it's just

931
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,720
crazy how you can get so many people

932
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,559
together and then there's not like you

933
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,838
don't like you don't need one person

934
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:30,920
person can take care of a couple

935
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:32,838
thousand people you just need like a few

936
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,280
people to be like all right we're going

937
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,039
to do this you know and uh yeah I don't

938
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,440
know like that's not in just in relation

939
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:43,480
to hippie Hill but as far as events you

940
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,240
know like people have the it we have it

941
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,800
in us to have really cool festivals and

942
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,919
events and be able to pull off some

943
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,359
crazy stuff I mean like the only thing

944
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,559
really going on like that I think that

945
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,119
is still I mean I don't know because I

946
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:01,000
don't go and I'm sure everybody who went

947
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,079
early on would say you would have their

948
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
critique but like burning man all these

949
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,440
people go they make a city and when they

950
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,400
leave there's just nothing there you

951
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,639
know and uh it seems like you could do

952
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,960
that anywhere with anything but

953
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:18,118
unfortunately you know like I go to the

954
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,480
river now and I'm like somebody left a

955
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,000
bag of beer bottles and dirty

956
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,119
diapers at the swimming hole and I'm

957
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,880
like what where's the how where's the

958
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,519
over with the people who actually want

959
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,119
to do some cool [ __ ] and they think you

960
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,000
just leave some [ __ ] there like you

961
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,400
know I don't know just one of those

962
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,199
things you know it makes it difficult

963
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,519
for everybody to keep [ __ ] together when

964
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,039
you got those kind of people wonder what

965
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,039
town they're

966
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,800
from right here the one up the road or

967
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,318
the one right down the road or the one

968
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,720
to the east or the West I'm guessing

969
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:55,599
maybe the one

970
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:59,439
down maybe

971
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,440
not hard to say

972
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,000
I love it I love it look and in your

973
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,480
answer you you referenced you know one

974
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,719
of the prior High Times events and you

975
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,639
know how people sort of didn't pull

976
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:12,159
their weight there well you know you you

977
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:16,440
gave me a perfect segue because in

978
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:18,719
Surprise News high times has gone into

979
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,760
receivership so let me pull up our

980
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:24,598
little image so um last time we spoke we

981
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,960
had no idea about this but it's come to

982
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,880
light that high times has actually been

983
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,039
struggling quite a bit the company has

984
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,440
been navigating murky waters for the

985
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,480
past 10 years since their cannabis cups

986
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,760
and magazine fell out of favor largely

987
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,719
attributed to poor quality management

988
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,920
and concerns from the community

989
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:44,919
regarding the authenticity of winners

990
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,680
and pay forplay Antics given High Times

991
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,599
is a cannabis company and cannabis

992
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,960
companies aren't federally legal they

993
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,519
say they can't file for bankruptcy but

994
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,159
they are able to go into receivership

995
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,639
it'll be interesting to see will they

996
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:00,279
get bailed out or may this be the end of

997
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,799
high times as we know it I guess the

998
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,400
question is do we think High Times is

999
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,960
worth saving as a legacy brand or has

1000
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,960
the scene progressed on too

1001
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:15,719
much yeah I don't know what do you think

1002
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,720
about this one Mr Sticker

1003
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,159
farmer did you grow up on high times at

1004
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,920
all more than you

1005
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:28,719
know more than you know I'll I'll show

1006
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,720
you actually

1007
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:37,199
OG they're right

1008
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,199
there

1009
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,759
look this is a collage I made out of

1010
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:44,759
high

1011
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,680
times when I was in high

1012
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,200
school this is the name of the brand I

1013
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:53,159
was making at the time 1996 that's cut

1014
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,919
out of a High Times

1015
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,879
magazine and uh on the back of it is a

1016
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,400
letter from a [ __ ] art teacher

1017
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,200
telling me to stop making weed

1018
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:08,200
art and I keep this in my house you know

1019
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,480
this lady probably also inspired me I

1020
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,039
probably don't give her enough credit

1021
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,800
I'm always bad mouthing her for this

1022
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,639
letter she wrote me about making weed

1023
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,400
art but um High time's huge subject

1024
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:21,118
matter in my my life uh let's fast

1025
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,960
forward to what we're talking about now

1026
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,960
I feel

1027
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,880
like that ship hasn't been driven by the

1028
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:35,679
best Captain for quite some time now it

1029
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,760
was very cool ton of very dope culture

1030
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,960
behind

1031
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:44,520
it um and probably

1032
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,240
the the payto playay events and some of

1033
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:47,960
those things I also think they crossed

1034
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,439
over into like dispensaries and things

1035
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,960
like that and I drive down the highway

1036
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,000
and there's a dispensary in Oakland and

1037
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,519
it's High Times building and it's

1038
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,960
covered in [ __ ]

1039
00:41:54,519 --> 00:42:01,039
plywood like H not I'd say that's a sign

1040
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,159
of the times not only for you know

1041
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:06,159
things going on in our cities but also

1042
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,679
for the brand

1043
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:14,118
maybe I would it

1044
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:17,919
up yeah yeah it's a bummer man I mean it

1045
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:20,838
really is like a you know I mean I

1046
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,639
remember being a teenager and being like

1047
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,400
like if someone told you like oh dude my

1048
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,118
picture got in High Times you'd be like

1049
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,039
what you got your picture in High Times

1050
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,160
like I remember it was

1051
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:37,279
2000 I want to say 2002 or something uh

1052
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:40,118
my buddy Maul uh J medy we took pictures

1053
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,800
in his um his mom's backyard and he sent

1054
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:46,160
them in of the of the of these medy

1055
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,400
plants and uh they got put in High Times

1056
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:51,639
and we were like whoa that's crazy we're

1057
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,280
in High Times like like you know was

1058
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:57,879
just thought it was the coolest thing

1059
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,640
ever you know and uh I mean

1060
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:05,280
you know it's a trip like I think in

1061
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:07,719
general now magazines are not like you

1062
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,920
know I mean there's the internet but

1063
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:13,838
like I don't know I I um I still get

1064
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,318
love from High Times They they post

1065
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:20,000
pictures of mine and stuff and like I I

1066
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:23,400
get like that it really boosts my Ig and

1067
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,318
um like uh people there are cool with me

1068
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,760
and ask me questions to check on

1069
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:30,199
articles check details and stuff

1070
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,000
and like I appreciate it and it's just

1071
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:34,679
funny because like as time goes on I

1072
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,119
don't know I guess it's like a being a

1073
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,239
being like a frog in a in a pot of water

1074
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,519
and it war and it warming up now I'm

1075
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:44,039
like yeah somebody from High Times cool

1076
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:47,358
you know but like it's just a weird

1077
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:50,679
thing because like I said 20 something

1078
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,799
years ago you know a picture is in there

1079
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:54,519
with our faces covered up and Only We

1080
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,160
Know It's us and we're like dude we're

1081
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:58,880
famous not really but like we felt like

1082
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:02,000
damn that's awesome these pictures are

1083
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,039
in a big magazine and everything and um

1084
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,400
but I don't think it only happened like

1085
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:10,079
to me personally being jaded by the weed

1086
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:14,160
thing I think also people in general

1087
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,400
don't um they don't regard it's like

1088
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:19,318
there's so much exposure all the time to

1089
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,318
all this stuff that people don't regard

1090
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:24,480
any of it that much I feel like somebody

1091
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:26,400
could like share your somebody could

1092
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,159
share Your Meme or something on a page

1093
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,119
that has 10 ion follows and you'd be

1094
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,719
like cool you know right right on like

1095
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,519
stuff that should be it used to have a

1096
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,558
lot more it used to hold a lot more

1097
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:39,239
Mystique for sure it used to be a lot

1098
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,880
more like it was like it was next to

1099
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:43,639
like the porno mags you know what I'm

1100
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,119
saying like it was like that and now you

1101
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:48,960
could go on your phone and find either

1102
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:52,838
readily available so yeah I think we're

1103
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,358
jaded to not only the fact that um you

1104
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:57,078
know this stuff is everywhere and we've

1105
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:59,239
seen a zillion pictures by now but how

1106
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:02,400
High Times was the [ __ ] for me dude High

1107
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:04,719
Times I put in a very high regard and I

1108
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,680
think they probably inspired a lot of

1109
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:10,399
people to not be afraid to to play with

1110
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,558
weed you know yeah and like as a grower

1111
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,200
I used to be scouring it like oh is

1112
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,000
there a a tip like anything that

1113
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,519
somebody said that sounded like it might

1114
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,400
be something cool that you never thought

1115
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:23,440
of you're like damn I should try that oh

1116
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,519
oh I didn't know that that's an answer

1117
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,000
to something and you listen and you're

1118
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,838
like you're use your critical thinking

1119
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,119
and you go that solved that right there

1120
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:32,400
that's what I needed to know and he

1121
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:35,039
might only be every once in a while but

1122
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,480
back then there was nowhere else to get

1123
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:40,400
that unless you like go and talk to

1124
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,599
somebody and you didn't feel comfortable

1125
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,599
back in the day even if you knew

1126
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,599
somebody was like a old schooler that

1127
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,039
knew a lot you weren't like hey tell me

1128
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,160
what you do because it was like you knew

1129
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:52,119
it was kind of stepping on toes it's

1130
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,358
kind of trade secrets and everything but

1131
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:56,720
like back to the the thing of like being

1132
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:58,679
jaded with stuff it's weird because I

1133
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:03,239
don't even think like I I look at it and

1134
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:05,440
I go oh magazines or what the media or

1135
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,439
newspapers but then I look at it now too

1136
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,119
and I go it seems like because of

1137
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,720
overexposure to everything like it

1138
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,760
almost has happened with almost

1139
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:17,318
everything like if you show somebody

1140
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,680
some real trippy kind of fruit they're

1141
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:20,759
like oh yeah I seen this one on

1142
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,879
Instagram I follow this dude in Florida

1143
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,040
like you know back in the day you'd be

1144
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,240
like dude what the hell is a sour soop

1145
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,920
now people are like yeah it's a sour

1146
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,598
soop I ordered one on the internet it

1147
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,519
came in two days and you know like weed

1148
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,200
is the same way like the way that we

1149
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:37,318
used to look at weed and you get one

1150
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:40,919
little nug of something crazy and you're

1151
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:43,279
just like dude what the hell it made

1152
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,079
like things be so everything could be

1153
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,960
legendary and now at this point you're

1154
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,480
kind of like there's the craziest things

1155
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,119
in the world and everybody's just kind

1156
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,280
of like cool yeah yeah I saw that you

1157
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,400
know it's weird man I used to have a

1158
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,839
bookshelf of encyclopedias as a kid and

1159
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,760
I would look through them for cool

1160
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:03,759
animals you know and that's how I saw

1161
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:07,040
cool animals I love animals and now I

1162
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,640
can go on I mean I mean I was happy with

1163
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:12,039
Steve Irwin you know I was happy with

1164
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:14,440
Crocodile Hunter and now you can go on

1165
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:17,000
Instagram and see all the exotic animals

1166
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,440
and snakes and birds and yeah like you

1167
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,079
said our exposure level has been turned

1168
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,920
way up and now we're harder to

1169
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:29,000
impress yeah yeah it's trippy I I think

1170
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,280
if you're like a media company like High

1171
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,159
Times and you're

1172
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,440
not ridiculously on top of it as far as

1173
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,879
whatever's going on with management and

1174
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,039
you know and I don't even look at it and

1175
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,200
go oh these guys are somebody's a [ __ ]

1176
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:43,838
up or whatever it is I'm like I know I

1177
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,598
personally couldn't keep like don't hand

1178
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,358
me High Times I'll [ __ ] it off guarantee

1179
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,559
I'm not I'm not it's hard to stay

1180
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,358
relevant yeah and to just just to manage

1181
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,400
all the different details of all of it

1182
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:59,318
and everything and uh you know it's just

1183
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,119
yeah I I don't know it's a um it's one

1184
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:07,639
of those it's one of those things

1185
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:10,039
where I don't know that it um I don't

1186
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:13,920
know I mean I I know it can be kept

1187
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:15,558
alive and I'd like to see it but it you

1188
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,039
know you

1189
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,240
figure you know that there's problems

1190
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,719
there has to be problems with the

1191
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,959
management because it's so big it's this

1192
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:27,279
monster it's so respected it's so

1193
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,679
legendary to whole few Generations of

1194
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,920
people and then it's like it's flopping

1195
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,919
so you know something's wrong there but

1196
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,039
at the same time you wonder too like

1197
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,400
okay it would have to be even if

1198
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:42,558
everyone's doing everything perfectly in

1199
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,519
this day and age it's still kind of hard

1200
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:48,160
to keep something like that alive and I

1201
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,000
personally hope that it turns around

1202
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,358
everything goes through waves just like

1203
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,318
you know people go through waves in

1204
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,759
their life it's like oh you got a friend

1205
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:57,119
and you see him and you're like damn

1206
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,319
he's all Manic and everything's [ __ ] off

1207
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,680
and going crazy and then you see him

1208
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,480
again you're like oh damn dude's doing

1209
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:04,440
good or you know you knew some dude who

1210
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,798
was like this legendary dude from back

1211
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,000
in the day and then you see him and he's

1212
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:09,480
been through some [ __ ] and he's just

1213
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,880
like all people are all soulen and their

1214
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,838
their Aura is all gray and [ __ ] you know

1215
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,760
and then like then they bounce back and

1216
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,279
you know you hope with everything like I

1217
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,040
always want to see everything do better

1218
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,480
I don't care what it is like doing

1219
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:24,719
better is better if it's whatever it is

1220
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,480
but uh High Times in particular I'd like

1221
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,399
to see it be able it bounce back I'd

1222
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,719
like to see cool High Times cups that

1223
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:35,200
used to be like something where I like

1224
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:37,838
really was curious what won and um of

1225
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:38,960
course there is a lot of you know

1226
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,960
there's

1227
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,000
like ever since the basically the 80s

1228
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,639
the dudes from like um Shanti Baba and

1229
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,760
those guys they're like yeah it was

1230
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:52,239
being bought it was being bought like

1231
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,880
you buy the cup that's how that worked

1232
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,879
but I also had good friends who I know

1233
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,200
for a fact they didn't have a name they

1234
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:01,280
didn't have a boo boo they had some weed

1235
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,838
that was so good that you could they

1236
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,960
couldn't even they were just like we got

1237
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:07,400
to give this guy first IND car or

1238
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,039
whatever you know I know a few people

1239
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,519
who who by the metric of it being bought

1240
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,838
they shouldn't have won and they won so

1241
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:18,639
even while it was funky there was still

1242
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,078
some some um some reality going on with

1243
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,920
the judging and everything and so

1244
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:24,760
knowing that from knowing those people

1245
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,400
it made me be like all right so what did

1246
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,319
win I'm still curious you know I'm

1247
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,720
always curious about what wins because

1248
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:34,239
somebody liked it and it was good enough

1249
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,239
that everybody's not like dude what what

1250
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,000
happened it's always like you know a lot

1251
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,479
of guys got some really good weed and

1252
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,199
whoever got the biggest Booth or

1253
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,159
whatever they gave it to them and you're

1254
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:47,199
like so it's still some Upper Crust [ __ ]

1255
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,159
you know um so but it would be cool to

1256
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,279
see it like actually like all right

1257
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:54,960
here's our new standards we're going to

1258
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,119
make it transparent it's going to be uh

1259
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,119
crowd judged and everybody puts the

1260
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,680
token with the one they like the best

1261
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,039
first place and whoever gets the most

1262
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:05,078
first place it wins there's somebody

1263
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,838
doing one like that sounded cool um it'd

1264
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:09,079
be cool to see it all bounce back

1265
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,440
biggest sponsor biggest sponsor won

1266
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:13,920
first place every time for the last five

1267
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,880
years yeah it's not surprising like

1268
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:21,318
that's how every every event I never saw

1269
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,798
it go any other way like I I mean I'm

1270
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:24,960
sure there's some of these other ones

1271
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:26,599
that don't operate like that but as far

1272
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,358
as the big boys that were using

1273
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:31,280
marketing tools and paying money and

1274
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:34,000
charging a lot of money for people to be

1275
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,960
part of it and filling you know large

1276
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,719
venues like this [ __ ] was a [ __ ] scam

1277
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:44,519
dude yeah and you know you're like it

1278
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:46,118
would be cool if it was all you know if

1279
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:48,318
it could all be transparent then you

1280
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:51,400
really know but the funny thing is for

1281
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:53,920
me personally even after even if I know

1282
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,680
something isn't fixed and it's all legit

1283
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,838
I'm still not like I'm like always

1284
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,558
curious oh who won what was it I'd like

1285
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,719
to see that but I'm never like oh I need

1286
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,760
to get that that's the new wave I'm

1287
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:09,159
always like no I know that I still like

1288

1293
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,000
marketing people pay money to be part of

1294
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,558
marketing so that um that all makes

1295
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,400
plenty of sense

1296
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,680
yeah yeah I mean you know like if people

1297
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,960
go to buy a wine they're like oh this

1298
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:38,118
wine has 93 points like it was but

1299
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,880
people don't even know that that scale

1300
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:43,838
has to be designed on how they grade it

1301
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,400
and if what you like is not included in

1302
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:50,119
that grading scale then you might like

1303
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,519
the 72o wine better than the 94o wine

1304
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,640
because you don't like what they like

1305
