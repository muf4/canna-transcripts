much it sounds like a pretty epic

151
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,599
introduction not sure if I'm worthy of

152
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,759
it but yeah thank you very much nice to

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,879
be here oh I had to put some respect on

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,280
it there was there was no doubt on that

155
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,839
my first question is what have you been

156
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,839
smoking on

157
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:53,840
recently uh I mix it up a lot um I'm uh

158
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:56,199
I make a lot of hashes myself and um I

159
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,399
kind of um we've always made ice and

160
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,199
we've made dry SI and Blended them

161
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,799
together it's kind of the old old school

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,879
part of me um when I tell people I used

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,240
grow all this biomass just to make a few

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:13,240
grams of hash they laugh but actually

165
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,680
it's the truth so I laugh in the end

166
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,519
yeah but actually mainly mainly hashes

167
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,639
but specific from like super silver haze

168
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,879
or mango Haze so we we grow a bunch do a

169
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,120
little dry sift and then we try it out

170
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,839
like that and it's always um enjoyable

171
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,038
I'm not

172
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,679
you know ah beautiful look I think

173
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,199
concentrates are definitely a growing

174
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,840
part of the market and our listeners

175
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,759
would love to hear what of your

176
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,560
varieties do you feel work particularly

177
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,639
well for making

178
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,120
concentrates well I mean there there's

179
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,639
definitely

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,280
varieties first of all um if you're

181
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,400
going to make a cved ash like a dry CV

182
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,519
like Morocco or something like that uh I

183
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,878
do go for um outdoor plants because

184
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,439
outdoor plants make much better uh

185
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,960
they've got better resin glands for um

186
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,519
when when you excite them and you make

187
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,560
the hash usually doesn't get milky when

188
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:14,680
you break it up like indoor resin pollen

189
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,199
and it's kind of um it becomes like a

190
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,478
solid hash and I must add that about 80%

191
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,478
of the market used to be hashish in

192
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,719
Europe before the the Green Revolution

193
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,560
sort of thing so and that's just the

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,960
since the 90 late ' 80s early 90s when

195
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,560
nor green started to change that ratio

196
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:36,478
around but um I and in different days I

197
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,240
love um certain varieties of marijuana

198
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,758
um but but Nord is a great strain to

199
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,319
make hash from the [ __ ] or the skunk one

200
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,598
mango Haze outstanding if you really

201
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,120
going for these flavors I mean that's

202
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:54,478
pretty hard to pass up and of course um

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,639
if you're game the Neville Haze is uh

204
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,680
and it's it's like the Champagnes of of

205
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,120
hashes for me so you know

206
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,639
um but because I had so much years of

207
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,120
experience I kind of I'm lucky enough to

208
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,400
be able to have these plants and create

209
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:16,079
those things and not share them

210
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:19,038
we sorry but don't make so much of them

211
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,079
you not commercial products all the time

212
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,680
yeah look you you nowed it on the head

213
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,279
I'm sure you've tried some things I can

214
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,079
only dream of and so I I wanted to ask

215
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,000
you know especially given that you had

216
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,519
you know the tight friendship with the

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
original Mr Nice himself Howard I would

218
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,759
love to ask what's the most memorable

219
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
hash you've ever

220
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,799
had

221
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,440
well I remember a distinct story um uh I

222
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,559
was getting busted by the police they

223
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,200
were searching my house around

224
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:51,079
2003 and there was a piece of hash that

225
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I had made um and one the C Cannabis Cup

226
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,839
with in I think it was

227
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,600
90 number 19 97 998 with Shany Baba hash

228
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,160
it was a hash that I really did a there

229
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,800
was no no movement it was just a dry SI

230
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:10,399
while we were cleaning this particular

231
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:13,199
um line of um of um skunks that I'd got

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,278
from Rob Clark and and I did it must

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,600
have been about 50 or 60 kilos over silk

234
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:22,600
screens and we made maybe 800 grams in

235
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,200
total and I I I sold that to Arian and

236
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,240
he entered it as Shanti bash in 98 I

237
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,000
think and we won the cup with that but I

238
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,879
kept a small piece and and whenever

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,639
Howard and I got together we would smoke

240
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,559
this one because it was outstanding it

241
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,519
was even Neville loved it I mean Neville

242
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,399
and I pressed it on the floor upstairs

243
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,480
above the the coffee shop years ago

244
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:51,399
98 and he said wow this is like that was

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,680
amazing pollen and uh so um when I was

246
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,078
getting I had some unfortunate problem

247
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,120
in at one stage in 2003 and the police

248
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,439
were searching the house and they the

249
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,879
policeman picked up this small remaining

250
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,800
piece of hash The Shanti Baba hash that

251
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,879
I had and it was about 2003 so four four

252
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,799
or five years after we'd won the cup

253
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,240
with and I only kept that for Neville

254
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:15,958
and I looked at him I said please you

255
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,519
can do whatever you want just that one's

256
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,479
something special if you can leave it

257
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,560
there I'd appreciate it and I don't know

258
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,200
it was just one of those amazing moment

259
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:26,958
still makes my hair stand up but the

260
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
policeman put it down there was about

261
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,039
six c y going through the house

262
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,440
searching and this guy I'll never forget

263
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,958
him he put it back and left it there and

264
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,160
when I got out from all the issue I had

265
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,599
that hash it was the only thing left and

266
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,799
I rang up Howard and I told him fly over

267
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,920
mate we have some work to do and uh

268
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,799
basically that that was a a really uh

269
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,078
yeah I was very sad when that finished

270
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,000
but every good thing comes to an end

271
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,120
unfortunately wow that that is an

272
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,039
absolutely brilliant story I love that

273
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,240
you knew what had to be done curiosity

274
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,879
was that um was that in Australia or in

275
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,879
like Switzerland no no that that was in

276
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:11,078
Switzerland in Switzerland in

277
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:14,439
2003 but but the hash I'd made 97 98

278
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:17,078
with Neville um uh and I'd been

279
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,200
collecting it for probably a year so I

280
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:22,319
mean you really make very small amounts

281
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,079
if you do very like 1% of whatever

282
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,959
you're doing or some people overdo the

283
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,559
spins and they start getting it green I

284
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,039
just like it where it's gray and white

285
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,239
and uh

286
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,159
tasty and um then we then we normally

287
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,759
once we finish the dry stuff we put it

288
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,639
in the the water and we make the ice and

289
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:44,039
then we blend them together in ratios to

290
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,879
find a good hash so it's a because the

291
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,439
what ice is is very strong it's almost

292
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,278
clinical you know what I mean so and the

293
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,200
dry is flavorsome and aromatic so when

294
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:57,200
you put them together you've still got

295
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,879
the same resins but they're slightly

296
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
different one's cleaner than the other

297
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,519
and the other's got toins and one

298
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,480
doesn't so you blend them together you

299
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,600
make a fantastic uh you know piece of

300
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,959
hash I suggest that to your viewers wow

301
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,040
yeah look the the art of blending is so

302
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,838
relatively unexplored in the industry I

303
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,559
think and you You' just probably outlaid

304
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,560
more knowledge on it than what I've ever

305
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,559
really heard I guess I'll just follow

306
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,039
that up do you do you like just trial

307
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,518
and error with the blending or is it

308
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,759
like you're trying to blend

309
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,799
tpin it you know it all began when we

310
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:35,519
were in the say the early 90s when I

311
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,759
first came to Amsterdam we used to try

312
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,440
to kind of um

313
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:46,078
replicate a breed by having a pure Haze

314
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,880
and a pure indica and and sort of 7525

315
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:52,559
or 5050 or and try to see how they they

316
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:56,919
came up so skunk or Northern Light Pure

317
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,838
or the hazes you could put 25 25 50%

318
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:02,679
together and you like that joint and you

319
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,560
kind of have an idea of what a breed May

320
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,078
generally be you know sort of be be

321
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:11,159
showing manifesting and and that would

322
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,638
be a way so the hash for me was an

323
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,319
extension of that because it's like um

324
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,240
wine making nowadays I I really I'm

325
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
right into um red wine especially from

326
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,399
uh you know I know quite a fair bit

327
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:27,000
about um Italian wines and and so I and

328
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,399
and Spanish ones and I I um I really

329
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,639
think that the blending of pure strains

330
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,159
in different proportions um you can

331
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,759
really make new New World Wines and

332
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,240
that's a good wine maker and know

333
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,958
everyone can have the same tools but

334
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,560
they don't do the same job you know

335
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,679
certain people have a understanding that

336
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,559
goes way and Beyond other people's

337
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,319
understanding when they're looking at

338
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,638
the same thing so I've never really been

339
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,639
worried about people copying I mean they

340
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,600
try their best but uh and they do some

341
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,440
people do better jobs than me at growing

342
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,199
flowers for sure but uh you know when it

343
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,360
comes to breeding I think it's we we

344
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,159
worked it out how to do that over the

345
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,839
last 40 50 years have been doing for a

346
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,759
while so you know oh wow we're going to

347
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,440
have to talk about some Italian wines

348
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,000
another day I'm passionate like yourself

349
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,440
but you've just uh got me curious have

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
you ever had any strains that were born

351
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,320
from that um sort of You Know Remix

352
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,480
process as you mentioned like where you

353
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
mix them and you were like you know what

354
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,199
let's do it and then it went on to make

355
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,519
something legendary yeah most of the

356
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,679
early stuff in the early '90s when I

357
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,320
used to sit around with Neville in his

358
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,000
place down in the south of Holland and

359
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,639
we would we would blend up different

360
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,198
view of things that we were working on

361
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:44,560
and try to and a lot of I mean it sounds

362
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:47,838
a bit of a goofy way to do things but

363
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,319
actually it's it's quite um a good

364
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:55,160
resource when when you're trying

365
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,839
to uh um imagine a sense you know what I

366
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,799
mean to to imagine a smell and a flavor

367
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,600
is very difficult you can imagine a

368
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:05,958
picture or something but flavors and

369
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,159
that it's very difficult concept and so

370
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:10,879
when you put a a kind of a practical

371
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,799
thing there and you could roughly taste

372
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,240
something that was in those proportions

373
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,679
and you know

374
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,198
maybe um slightly different hazes and

375
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,479
slightly different skunks gave a

376
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:22,679
different things so you could tweak them

377
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,600
a little bit we were lucky enough to be

378
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,559
growing so many different things and

379
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,560
different versions of the same seeds we

380
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,078
could play with sister

381
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,159
and um a lot of a lot of love and time

382
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:38,000
went into it it was very it's creative

383
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,838
process which most people might not kind

384
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,600
of understand but um it's it's uh it's

385
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,199
like a fourth dimension breeding you

386
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,079
know you have to visualize different

387
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,439
parallel things that are very hard to

388
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:52,479
put your finger on and words to most of

389
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,120
the time so you know we come to it

390
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,319
ourselves and everyone has a feeling as

391
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,078
well so that that hopefully if you've

392
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,639
got a bit of intuition about things or

393
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,120
you use them a lot and you know what

394
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:08,240
you're talking about which Neville and I

395
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,759
did um we both sort of came to we we

396
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,318
self- policed ourselves we didn't

397
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,360
[ __ ] you know if it didn't work

398
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,759
didn't work and you know but when it

399
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,360
worked a little bit you thought and you

400
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,199
follow that down the line a little bit

401
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,959
and create a few strains sorry oh I

402
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,879
think you're under selling it with a few

403
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,679
but uh that that's really legendary to

404
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,919
hear I'm so stoked to hear that cuz I've

405
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,439
heard some people talk about blending

406
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,759
flour but I think you're you're right

407
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,399
how should be the next level up so the

408
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,079
question that comes to mind is is is

409
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,919
this largely speaking how you approach

410
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,479
breeding these days or is it more of

411
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,000
like a paper you know you write things

412
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,639
down and just see what

413
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,519
works I have um my can of Bible and I

414
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:53,120
write notes about everything because a

415
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:56,120
lot of seed uh um um sort of packages I

416
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,560
have in the fridge are from different um

417
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,278
sort of stages of the breeding so I can

418
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,198
go back to the second stage and continue

419
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,119
it on to the fifth stage if I've got

420
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,359
time or so I've got a lot of projects

421
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,078
like first second third fourth fifth

422
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:14,318
stage in the fridge all the time uh the

423
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:16,198
thing is that um you know I don't think

424
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,279
there's a lot of breeding going on so

425
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,720
much anymore U

426
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,558
unfortunately uh maybe this tissue

427
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,078
culture is going to save it and maybe

428
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:28,399
you know sort of laboratory kind of um

429
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,079
catalyzed breeding will will happen with

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,840
with the reconstitutions and stuff but

431
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,079
old you know selective natural selection

432
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,000
breeding which is something that I still

433
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,399
think is um it has much more Merit

434
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,720
because it's both Theory and practical

435
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,960
in a in an

436
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,200
area um you know uh without chemicals

437
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,319
and spraying male females to make them

438
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,720
male and do all of that which is that

439
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:57,038
this new sort of fast food culture um

440
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,360
for me it it used to take two years to

441
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,038
make a breed or longer for four five

442
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,599
years you know and and people want

443
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:07,519
something new every week nowadays so I

444
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:10,199
mean they're just spraying galado to

445
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,759
Girl Scout cookie to wedding cake and I

446
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,400
don't even know what these parents are

447
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,720
anymore so I don't even know what they

448
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,000
when they talk about these names I I

449
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,679
have no idea what we're talking about is

450
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,200
it a skunk is it a Kush is it skunk Kush

451
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,640
is it usually those two but I mean very

452
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,159
very little is anything else you know

453
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,280
every so often you might hit something

454
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,640
that's got a little bit of Seda in it

455
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:35,879
but um or or a bit of haze but I don't

456
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,600
think anyone really knows the origins of

457
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,159
what they're talking about nowadays

458
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,759
because you know they don't have to

459
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,919
select males very

460
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:47,519
often you know only regular C companies

461
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,559
do yeah I mean is it safe to say that we

462
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,599
probably won't see any F being offered

463
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,879
by you in the future for that reason I

464
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,480
I've never I've never um and I've said

465
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,320
it right from the beginning of of that

466
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,720
whole thing U Mr Nice is I keep it kind

467
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,599
of regular Seed Company even though we

468
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,960
make feminized seed for other companies

469
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:11,359
and we've made it for CBD crew our other

470
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,079
project um we don't believe we don't

471
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,959
want people to breed with feminized seed

472
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:19,038
we would prefer them to search out real

473
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,519
males and real females true males and

474
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,119
true females um and and use feminized

475
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,798
seed or autof flowering seed for

476
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:29,038
flowering you know and making um that

477
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,798
sort of thing they all they all have a

478
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,359
kind of application as far as I'm

479
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,879
concerned I don't have anything against

480
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:36,918
them it's just that um we're probably

481
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,919
more purist at heart and we would like

482
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,759
to continue that and and there's a lot

483
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,759
more people buying our seed nowadays for

484
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:46,079
the males so uh I don't think there

485
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,480
there's a lot of people that can find

486
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,240
the origins or know where they picked up

487
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that variety from and and what are

488
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,839
joined to in in what year in Holland you

489
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,519
know what I mean I'm I hav been doing it

490
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,319
a long time so I suppose that become

491
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:04,079
that knowledge becomes with after a

492
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:06,798
period of decades you know what I mean

493
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,399
hugely hugely look you you mentioned the

494
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,918
CBD crew and this is something I

495
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,880
definitely wanted to touch on because

496
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,759
the very first CBD I ever smoked I got

497
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,960
from CBD sharkshock from uh from some of

498
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,720
your work it was a brilliant plant what

499
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,319
stimulated you to get into the CBD work

500
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,120
cuz as far as I can tell you were one of

501
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:29,439
the first yeah we were the first we were

502
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:33,599
the first by a long way um I came out of

503
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,400
jail in In switzland and um um i' had

504
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,199
sort of taken the responsibility of the

505
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,320
whole company on my shoulders for that

506
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,759
issue and I thought you know THC had

507
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,519
been it was was allowed for the about

508
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,158
four or five years in switzland we were

509
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,158
making a lot of it and then all of a

510
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,679
sudden we had the period where it was

511
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,880
not allowed anymore and it kind of I

512
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,320
didn't wasn't going to change my job so

513
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,120
I had to come out with a a new kind of

514
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:06,000
tact and while I was in we we realized I

515
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,000
was always reading and stuff and then

516
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,240
when I came out I was talking to some

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,679
very good friends and we um we were

518
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,679
talking about all the other cannaboids

519
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,159
you know maybe it's time now because

520
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,559
we've been working with Laboratories a

521
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,760
little bit uh we were one of the we were

522
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,319
the first to work with Cana foundation

523
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:27,200
in Spain and they sponsored CBD crew to

524
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,399
do all the testing so we could actually

525
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,600
make a scientific Seed Company where we

526
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,440
could prove every step of the way rather

527
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,959
than Mr ice or the greenhouse that was

528
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,519
just feeling that was what I liked and

529
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,400
hopefully other people liked it and and

530
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:45,599
that you know so one's my opinion and

531
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,840
the other one was science in the way and

532
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,199
and so sding crew came out of

533
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,199
self-rehabilitation

534
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,200
maybe something like that thinking how

535
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,360
can I continue on working on the plant

536
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,600
but be legal because I had enough of

537
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,038
being persecuted for working on a plant

538
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:04,719
that doesn't know that it's illegal I

539
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:07,839
mean you know the most ridiculous

540
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,839
situation you could ever talk about but

541
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,158
um I live in that world unfortunately

542
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,639
and I've had a lot of uh harsh realities

543
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:16,600
you know and so the family gone through

544
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,440
a lot of stuff but I'm still here doing

545
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:21,798
it so

546
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,600
obviously you know it's part of the life

547
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,639
and so you have to come to terms with it

548
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,839
and and try to work out the best way and

549
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:35,038
at that stage 200 six s we started

550
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:37,038
delving in and by 2009 we'd found a crew

551
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,240
and we had already developed stuff and

552
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,158
then uh we brought it to the world and

553
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,599
then we started we offered it actually

554
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,080
the CBD crew was the first company that

555
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,918
went to all the other companies like

556
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,278
Barney farm and Dutch fashion and and

557
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:55,240
and uh and Paradise and oh there's about

558
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:56,720
20 of them medical seeds and and we

559
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,400
offered to

560
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,798
CBD their two main plants which they all

561
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:08,080
sent me to two of their mothers we did

562
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:09,759
the work over about uh year and then we

563
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,399
gave them a sample they had to approve

564
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,359
it and then they'd have to buy the Seed

565
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,038
off us for the first year until they

566
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,319
worked out how to do it themselves so we

567
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:21,200
it was kind of the very first seed Union

568
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:24,599
I've been pushing for for many years but

569
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,000
I had to do it by sort of fruit force

570
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,240
and having something that they didn't

571
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,919
have but St but and they all wanted and

572
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,880
you see what happened with CBD was

573
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,919
strange they went ballistic for a while

574
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,559
and uh now of course you know like I

575
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,159
said it was Agricultural and now it's

576
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,599
come back to being Agricultural and not

577
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,960
another another form of recreation or

578
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,480
where everyone thought the same money

579
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,558
would be there for CBD flowers but it's

580
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,400
not it's a it's a medical product you

581
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,558
know yeah wow what an incredible story

582
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,320
and I think we all owe you you know a

583
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:00,879
thank you for the perseverance on that

584
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:03,480
one um I guess I'd love to ask a lot of

585
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,120
companies out there uh had to work from

586
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,400
like hemp and various sort of um stock

587
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,839
to get that CBD is that how you sort of

588
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,559
developed that initial project or did

589
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,079
you find a special plant that happened

590
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:18,158
to exhibit it not not at all what we we

591
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:21,439
came the difference between what uh the

592
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,159
thinking was this that hemp had been on

593
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,440
the market for many years and under 3%

594
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,200
THC and it didn't have any value when it

595
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,240
came to Turing profile and I always

596
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,679
thought Turpin profile always thought

597
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,960
Turpin profile has something very very

598
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,278
strong to do with the whole

599
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,200
effect okay this is before everyone um

600
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,960
um hypothesized about Entourage effect

601
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,278
and that but I always thought that when

602
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,640
you you found something that was

603
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:52,759
exceptionally um um um you know like a

604
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,320
Fone something that you really liked and

605
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:57,480
you were attracted to and the flavor and

606
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:01,439
The Taste did something to you then you

607
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,558
obviously had something as well as the

608
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,080
the CBD and the THC and whatever else

609
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:10,639
was in there so um my idea was to come

610
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:13,000
from recreational and bring it down so

611
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,759
bring bring instead of bringing the

612
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,200
THC down up from uh um um a hemp variety

613
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:24,038
we decided to bring the THC down and the

614
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:28,720
CBD up and finally enough we had found a

615
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:31,319
pure CBD plant um it was uh it was

616
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,159
selected by a guy in Spain and we tested

617
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:37,480
it all and that was the parent remedy we

618
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,840
called it and uh that was the parent to

619
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,319
most everything that's began this

620
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,918
enrichment in CBD and the reason why we

621
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,639
did it one to one was first of all when

622
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:51,159
you take a pure THC and you take a pure

623
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,200
CBD the the next generation is 50/50

624
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,720
basically and for me that was the

625
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,519
medicine when you increase the CBD to a

626
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,679
level of you know higher than the one

627
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:05,918
the 3% but and you brought it up to sort

628
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,240
of uh 15 16 and and also the TC to 8 or

629
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,120
9 or 10 there was a completely different

630
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,399
effect and that was the medical for me

631
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,558
that was the beginning of the medical um

632
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:17,398
Concepts and since then I I've started

633
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:19,278
up my own pharmaceutical company in

634
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:22,879
Czech Republic as well

635
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:26,798
so yeah we make a lot of um Pills and

636
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,278
and and oils and we Supply a lot of

637
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,200
Australian companies with the base

638
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:34,640
products and they do all their packaging

639
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,759
over here under our our lbel so we we we

640
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,240
branched out into that that's why I

641
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,720
probably left breeding a little bit and

642
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,359
went into trying to influence other

643
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,360
parts of the world bit stubborn

644
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,240
pigheaded I suppose but you know you got

645
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,558
to learn as I said we we've all

646
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,558
benefited from it and as you said in the

647
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,639
last answer you know that CBD sort of

648
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:55,440
had its rise to fame and it's fallen

649
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,440
down a little bit but I'd love to hear

650
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,960
what do you think is the future of CBD

651
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,880
and out of your offer Springs what is

652
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,360
just a general CBD strain you could

653
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,240
recommend to people if they're Keen to

654
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:08,558
give it a go well I I think CBD has a

655
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,759
very big future I just think that the

656
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,440
hype behind it all

657
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:15,079
like the hype behind the Canadian

658
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,558
companies going on the stock market the

659
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,879
hype behind all of that is just the

660
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,519
first wave of of silliness you know

661
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,760
people with too much money that want to

662
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,720
invest in something and think they're

663
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,398
going to become millionaires tomorrow

664
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,798
they all run to one side of the ship the

665
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,239
ship goes down and then slowly you get

666
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,879
rid of those people and you get the

667
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,000
second wave where the ship is back

668
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,960
standing again and now you have to kind

669
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,240
of understand how these Concepts fit in

670
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,120
CBD is a plant that should be growing

671
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,839
Outdoors first of all it doesn't need to

672
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,959
have indoor cultivation the flour is

673
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:51,439
never enough for a person really to to

674
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,240
gain the full CBD effect you need over

675
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,960
20% um and so we make pills with 6% CBD

676
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,000
you take two or three it dep you know

677
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,000
you start micro and and you go up um and

678
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,759
there's big benefits of CD there's no

679
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,839
doubt about that in my mind and uh it I

680
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:10,558
use it maybe twice or three times a week

681
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:13,119
my kids have been using it since I've

682
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,639
made it I got about five or six pills

683
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:18,639
like we sell it now in blister packs

684
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:22,840
where we we look like proper company and

685
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,399
it's all um underneath the three% for

686
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,759
the European market and and no THC for

687
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:32,518
many of the products but the CBD and the

688
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:34,759
tur so the Turpin um the Turpin was a

689
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,120
very big thing for us and it proved to

690
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:41,319
be correct because basically when we did

691
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:44,439
select a particular strain um I it was

692
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:46,398
yummy to CBD yummy to I only work with

693
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,480
that strain it makes all my the base

694
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,158
products it makes all the distillation

695
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,440
so I clone it I put it outside and we

696
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,278
grow fields of that and then we do that

697
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,840
for the extraction so we are very

698
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:01,558
specific we're not growing from seed to

699
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,558
uh for that we are growing from clone

700
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,678
that has been selected and been tested

701
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:08,558
and and so I already know what we're

702
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,640
making um whereas Farmers they grow the

703
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,918
seed varieties they do extraction make

704
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,399
it into isolate pretty much it's a

705
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,120
single compound so they don't have to

706
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:19,278
think about anything they just need to

707
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,759
get the percentages up of CBD to make it

708
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,960
more valuable or less valuable so

709
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,158
there's many ways to to go about this

710
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,640
whole thing but for me CBD is

711
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,640
agricultural you know that's

712
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,519
what many people should understand and

713
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,200
it always has been in my head and it

714
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,000
always will be because you need to grow

715
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,240
a large amount of biomass to extract it

716
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,079
to make the price still normal right at

717
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,480
the beginning the price was about 80,000

718
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,079
Euros a kilo this is when we first

719
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,480
started because no one extracted it now

720
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:56,319
you can buy for $250 a kilo uh you know

721
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,480
this is one of the biggest drops in the

722
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,759
world where everything's going up that's

723
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,319
come down you know what I mean big time

724
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:07,558
and so you have to be a huge industrial

725
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,599
hemp farmer to make it profitable um and

726
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,158
and a lot of the small guys we thought

727
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,519
they were going to make millions have

728
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,120
all disappeared over the the last few

729
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,960
years so there's still production of

730
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,479
course and we still condone it we're

731
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,038
still doing it ourselves but there's

732
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,159
production for what you can sell and

733
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:27,038
what your Market is not just for the

734
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,000
world and uh so I don't suggest people

735
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,038
get into anything that they don't have a

736
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,079
market for because I mean then you're

737
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,879
just holding it and it cost money to

738
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,678
make it so you know you can lose a lot

739
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,519
of

740
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:43,120
things yeah but I I I know from

741
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,679
experience there you go Sage advice

742
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,678
there so take me back to the start what

743
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:53,440
was your first experience with

744
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:55,679
cannabis jeus that was LE in Melbourne

745
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,720
um with a group of friends I remember I

746
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,200
remember the one time I I first got ston

747
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,679
um because we we smoked a few times

748
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,919
and um I was around 14 15 it didn't

749
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:11,480
really happen I I think I'd finished

750
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,840
school done my HSC started at Melbourne

751
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,919
uni and um went over to a m place on the

752
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,798
weekend and he had there was a row of

753
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,639
houses on one side and then a strip of

754
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,960
grass on the another side and we used to

755
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:26,759
smoke

756
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,360
bongs and some guy down the road had

757
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,200
given us his home grow whatever and we

758
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,479
put it in the bong and it got so ston

759
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,159
first time ever you know and I

760
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,519
remember my me and my mate thought we

761
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,919
saw this white line down this green

762
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,079
strip and it went up a hill and so we

763
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,000
were on our knees following each other

764
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,960
this white line and and then I realized

765
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,798
when what are we doing here you know and

766
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,919
I real and we start laughing our heads

767
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,599
off and realized we must be really Stone

768
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,559
this is the effect and we laughed a

769
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,398
six-pack you know what I mean it felt

770
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:00,158
like

771
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,518
I yeah so it was a really good

772
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,600
experience it was ridiculous of course

773
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,759
but so is most things in life you know

774
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,879
that you laugh

775
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,798
at um and yeah that was one of the first

776
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,000
ones I remember for sure that's

777
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,879
brilliant I love that hope I hope other

778
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,960
people can relate uh at that time were

779
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,600
there did varieties have names or was it

780
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,600
still in that era of like just good

781
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,879
versus less good was called grass you

782
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:27,558
know and you would just get whatever the

783
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,639
dealer or your mate had or whoever grew

784
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:33,319
it or some friend of a friend who you

785
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:35,319
know had ripped off someone's brand a

786
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:38,839
branch off the that was over hanging

787
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:41,558
there their fence or something I mean in

788
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,798
those days in the in the 80s I was

789
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,678
landscape gardening in Melbourne and and

790
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:46,960
um mean I knew where all marijuana was

791
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,399
because we were always down the back

792
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,519
lanes and bringing in dirt and soil and

793
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:54,918
and um and Turf and stuff and you know

794
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,000
you always saw when you're standing on a

795
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,639
trailer you can see who's growing one or

796
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,440
two dop plants here and there it didn't

797
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:04,398
seem such a big thing but there was

798
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,840
always you know if cops found it you'd

799
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,359
have a big big adventure unfortunately

800
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,678
but I never saw it as a criminal

801
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,839
activity and I still don't and even

802
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,559
though I've unfortunately had some time

803
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:20,678
to ponder things in in Swiss hotels and

804
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:24,398
Italian hotels you know um I call them

805
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:27,399
the left the jails um I I kind of never

806
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,239
really never diluted down my my feeling

807
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:31,038
about it because the plant the plant

808
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,798
doesn't know all this [ __ ] that

809
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:36,519
humans put you know and out of curiosity

810
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,440
what was the progression from sort of

811
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:39,638
that point to you growing for the first

812
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,519
time

813
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,359
yourself uh well I mean it was an

814
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:46,558
outstanding experience and I thought

815
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:49,519
well if I find some seeds then better

816
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,798
get into this because um I was always

817
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,319
into um one of our first jobs I was

818
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,558
always the kind of the a bit of the

819
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,798
leader to find work and then employ my

820
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,798
friends you know and we would always be

821
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,599
painting houses or weeding Gardens you

822
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,119
know and then weeding Gardens started to

823
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:07,119
take over and became like fixing up

824
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,199
Gardens and I slowly went into landscape

825
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,519
gardening while I was at Uni as well so

826
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,719
there were parallel things and I I just

827
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,039
loved I loved different varieties of

828
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,118
plants and I like growing things and and

829
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,759
and getting harvests of fruit and from

830
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,879
Passion Fruit to bananas to avocados to

831
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,919
I mean I I love all that stuff still to

832
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,799
this day I live on a in an apartment in

833
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,918
and and and I still have tomatoes

834
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,560
growing and and cucumbers and all the

835
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:38,480
herbs and every I've become very talized

836
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,918
but uh but you

837
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,000
know I live on the border of Italy and

838
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,118
Switzerland so I kind of um you know go

839
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,480
there a lot and and very influenced in

840
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,679
their food and culture the Italians are

841
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,358
really excellent at that by the way

842
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,760
they're the first ones to ban all this

843
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,440
artificial growing meat and stuff

844
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,440
officially so they I really like them

845
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,480
for that you know they think that uh you

846
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,559
don't need 90 different you know

847
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,240
chemicals in in something rather just

848
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:10,799
one and it's you know they grow it in

849
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,239
their pastes so I like their attitude

850
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
like that the Italians and and the

851
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,679
Europeans are pretty good you know

852
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,560
they're not like the Americans or the

853
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,639
Australians or Canadians where you know

854
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,400
the F food seems to be a lot more in the

855
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,719
culture kind of thing yeah hugely hugely

856
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,079
that you know sort of looping back to

857
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,799
when you were speaking about Italian

858
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,480
wines when started to sort of learn a

859
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,440
bit more about them and how many

860
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,320
indigenous varieties of grapes they have

861
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,240
and how they grow them it echoes the

862
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,200
sentiment you just said perfectly right

863
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,439
like they they know what's up yeah well

864
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:42,799
I just just wanted to say that that

865
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,559
there's this kind of invisible line

866
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,240
going through Europe and it it it

867
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:51,719
touches Spain south of France Italy

868
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:53,799
Croatia and it's the kind of the olive

869
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:57,118
oil line and then above that is the

870
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,680
butter kitchen and and and so the north

871
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,440
of Europe is very much Dairy and stuff

872
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,838
and I I mean I've been vegetarian I eat

873
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,920
fish sometimes but I I'm mainly

874
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:10,559
plant-based food for the last 40 years

875
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,039
so um I've always been on the olive oil

876
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:16,838
side because it's very different kind of

877
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:19,480
um tast and Mediterranean cooking and so

878
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:22,920
um the the the wealth of knowledge that

879
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,199
the farmers from these areas had um I go

880
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,800
to balos 2 hours from my home you know

881
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,598
and it's probably one of the greatest

882
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,920
places in the world and Neola is

883
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,838
probably my favorite grap of all time

884
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:37,800
Tempo and neolo you know they're up

885
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:41,318
there in there and so of course uh the

886
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:45,920
time truffles Pini mushrooms and and the

887
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:48,480
they're harvesting the doto and and and

888
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,159
Barbara and and now they're probably

889
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,318
this week they're doing the niola so at

890
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,759
the same time is the Harvest for for our

891
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:58,119
outdoor marijuana it's funny you know I

892
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,960
kind of

893
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,960
I kind of keep an eye on it all and I

894
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,800
live in an area where there's all Merlo

895
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,440
I mean this part of Switzerland it's all

896
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,519
Merlo I'm not a big fan of M but I mean

897
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,639
I live amongst the The Vineyards here so

898
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,599
um it's just interesting to to um um

899
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,639
kind of draw parallels from agriculture

900
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,960
you know and the experience that our

901
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,199
grandparents had they used to always

902
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,400
grow vegetable gardens and even you know

903
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,199
Australia was you couldn't go to every

904
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,039
shop to buy all that stuff sometimes you

905
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,639
had to you sort of do it yourself and uh

906
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,400
my grandfather on my father's side and

907
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,879
my mom's side they were both Aid

908
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,119
gardeners so I suppose I I I got bug

909
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,440
from that kind of beginning there you go

910
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,000
intergenerational I love that there's a

911
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,880
a lot of good points there and I love

912
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,960
that you're a nebiolo fan we're we're

913
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,079
Kindred Spirits there so yeah yeah well

914
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,559
if you get over here I've got quite a

915
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:55,760
big collection I have to say gets the

916
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,318
Australian Scene It uh unfortunately

917
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,520
I've only got one bottle of Baro cuz

918
00:37:57,318 --> 00:38:01,480
they they like to mark but that's all

919
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,838
good that's all good maybe we can visit

920
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,519
that another time to loop back to the

921
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,880
the last question how did you progress

922
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:10,239
from sort of when you were first getting

923
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,838
into it to doing that initial work in

924
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,279
Mal and Bimi and was that where you

925
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,920
would say you first sort of got deep

926
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,839
into the scene or would you say it was

927
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,760
before

928
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:22,960
that uh it was a bit before that I I I

929
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,520
was growing down but the I mean that was

930
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,039
the early days in Melbourne un and and

931
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,239
um my girlfriend uh her her she'd

932
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,199
growing up in Melbourne and then moved

933
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:37,118
up to main AR in near Mal

934
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,159
Bimi and I had a company called main AR

935
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,880
Landscaping I named it after that but it

936
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:45,000
was in Melbourne and I used to go sort

937
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,599
of do uni uh work a little bit in the

938
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,280
landscaping and then I would go up to uh

939
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,680
mullum uh kind of once a month or that

940
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,400
during the UN time and and because we

941
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,480
were growing dope

942
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,119
outside um uh you kind of had to check

943
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,400
on it and you know was all very illegal

944
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,599
and bringing it down on the train you

945
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,960
know sort of uh I don't know a kilo or

946
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:12,200
whatever two a pillow it was all sewing

947
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,000
in to a pillow and and you know plastic

948
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:17,078
wrapped and we didn't have the vacuum

949
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,559
seals in those days but we made it as as

950
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,800
good as we could and and we would sell

951
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:25,960
it in in a matter of hours at in Melvin

952
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,039
you know to all my uni friends we just

953
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,838
basically supplying

954
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,559
um the uni guys and and and that was so

955
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:37,239
special that marijuana it really reminds

956
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:39,880
me I think it's very very much the same

957
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:44,159
as Neville Hayes but it was a outdoor

958
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,240
growing um Thai Thai Colombian mixtures

959
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,679
for sure they were definitely involved

960
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,199
in that and they were a very long leaf

961
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:53,639
and and and you know that that became

962
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,078
huge plants but you could bend them over

963
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,838
and and sort of train them as well so

964
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,760
you know to operation Noah used to

965
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:02,279
always be going on you know certain

966
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,560
times of the year up there the

967
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,720
helicopters were flying and the

968
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,960
motorbike cops were going in to try to

969
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:12,199
buff grow so yeah we survived all of

970
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,960
that and no one got really maybe lost a

971
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,879
few plants here and there to a few

972
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,639
people

973
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,440
but had to worry about brown snakes and

974
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,440
and [ __ ] like that more than anything

975
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,039
else so I mean that was what terrorizing

976
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,880
you know we kind of cut our teeth on a

977
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,880
different way I suppose in Australia you

978
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,519
know it was was kind of good yeah wow

979
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,160
that that's legendary and I mean in

980
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,679
terms of the mull Madness I think the

981
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,639
question I hear the most is what's the

982
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:41,239
genetics and you just gave a good answer

983
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,719
to that how did those genetics come

984
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,399
about was it just something that your

985
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,279
friends had access to and you wanted to

986
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,200
improve it oh you know there there

987
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,920
there's a couple of um schools of

988
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,799
thought and and I don't want to um sort

989
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,680
of put anyone down who was in that

990
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,880
period of time but in that period of

991
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,399
time there was no real

992
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,880
um it's not like now where we shared

993
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,720
knowledge you know if you were a dope

994
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,240
grower kind people knew you were a dope

995
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,879
grower but you didn't really talk about

996
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,719
it you know you didn't even you didn't

997
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,240
want to put yourself into problem's way

998
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,000
and you didn't want to show that you

999
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:18,318
knew that someone else was in problems

1000
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,760
way in case who go um however sometimes

1001
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,639
you became friendly with a few and you

1002
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,000
swap some seeds with this person they

1003
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:26,000
just come back from a travel in Thailand

1004
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,239
or somebody come back from Colombia with

1005
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,280
some Panama Red or someone had come back

1006
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:35,479
from uh another spot you know Cambodia

1007
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,680
or or or Laos or something and I think a

1008
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:42,000
lot of Australians were in that whole

1009
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:43,679
band Archer and in in in the 80s the 70s

1010
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,159
and 80s a lot of people were traveling

1011
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,239
hippies were traveling and bring in

1012
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:50,358
collecting seed I collected for wax jamb

1013
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,358
I collected for fruit for everything and

1014
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:54,199
and of course Australia is not legal to

1015
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:56,480
bring back so we used to send it and I

1016
00:41:54,199 --> 00:42:00,279
it in things when we sent it back in the

1017
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:04,838
post and so a lot of things came from

1018
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:08,119
let's just say areas but unknown Origins

1019
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:11,000
you know and our version of M Mimi

1020
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,119
Madness was very similar uh to what were

1021
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,239
re Rec recreated with the nibbles Haze

1022
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,559
and as far as I'm concerned was a very

1023
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:22,159
long flowering plant um it was

1024
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,839
absolutely mind-blowing when it came to

1025
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:27,960
smoking it and flavors and it had an

1026
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:32,039
Alpine spicy

1027
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:35,519
Menthol um uplifting um effect you know

1028
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:38,400
and it was it was psychedelic it it

1029
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,800
still is if you pay too much of course

1030
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,160
but I mean if you balance those things

1031
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,800
uh um and then you get used to them

1032
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,639
sometimes so you have to mix it up with

1033
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,760
different varieties to to keep

1034
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,239
everything good but yeah I suppose the

1035
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,400
origins for us came from those areas

1036
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,919
that I mentioned yeah amazing you know I

1037
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,160
I think the reason why it's so popular

1038
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,639
is because there's so much sort of

1039
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,558
Allure and mystery around it and in

1040
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:06,078
Australia you know every uh every Avid

1041
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,400
grower in Mal Bimi likes to think

1042
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,079
they've got the original mull Madness so

1043
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,039
I'd be curious to know did you did you

1044
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,559
ever really give the seeds out or was it

1045
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,318
more just something you kept for

1046
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:18,559
yourself I did give our version of seeds

1047
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,358
to several people Growers over the years

1048
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,920
that are requested and um I've still got

1049
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:27,199
them in the fridge upstairs in the

1050
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,720
office and um I have a lot of uh um um

1051
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,480
strains that I collected and and you

1052
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:33,959
know they're all noted and they've been

1053
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,559
you know I've got stuff from the late

1054
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,318
80s still in the fridges from Neville's

1055
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,519
stock and my stock and and you know and

1056
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:43,639
still germinates but much less of course

1057
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,599
if you keep it vacuum filled in fridges

1058
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,639
and not taking in and out all the time

1059
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,599
you can keep see for quite a long time

1060
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:54,318
just the germination levels go down and

1061
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:58,119
and we've manag to get back um if at the

1062
00:43:54,318 --> 00:44:02,440
moment we've got a couple of um

1063
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:06,400
old Northern Lights uh too and some Orga

1064
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:10,400
by Orga and fewer

1065
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,800
Haze um variety pure Haze we I've busted

1066
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,440
out a few old seed to see if we can get

1067
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,800
them something going from them as well

1068
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,318
because we got a bit of room in our

1069
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,400
research area now and I would like to

1070
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:23,480
revive a couple of really old hash plant

1071
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,920
that's it we got one um uh it's a

1072
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,280
four-way indicia kind of thing the

1073
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,599
original hash plant the ones I've seen

1074
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,160
all over the net they don't look

1075
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,920
anything like the has plant that I

1076
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:36,558
remember working on with

1077
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:40,079
Neville um and so you kind of a bit

1078
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:42,680
inspired to correct not correct just to

1079
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,760
put out an original version to show you

1080
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:47,759
what we thought was hash plant you know

1081
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,720
nowadays names mean [ __ ] and they mean

1082
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,599
nothing actually because no one's giving

1083
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:54,399
origins of where plants or varieties

1084
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,359
come from and so it's

1085
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,119
very very very difficult thing for for

1086
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,799
someone who's got an inquisitive mind to

1087
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,800
try to um understand where does that

1088
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,400
strain originate from is it Afghani

1089
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,400
original is it Mexican is it you know

1090
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,480
what I mean

1091
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:14,358
it so they're all hybrid by hybrids by

1092
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,280
chemical hybridization so it's kind of

1093
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:19,400
losing its uh that's what I meant by the

1094
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,480
breeding has kind of been watered down

1095
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,280
and and and became um too quick you know

1096
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,838
people you know if you want something

1097
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,160
good in life you you got to spend a bit

1098
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:31,159
of time on it and make sure that you

1099
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,639
test everything properly to make sure

1100
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,159
the people are getting what you're

1101
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,358
saying and not a lot of that is going on

1102
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:38,920
anymore unfortunately you know testing

1103
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,159
happens when you buy the Seed and you're

1104
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,960
the tester and the purchaser and the

1105
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:47,318
retailer and the consumer so you

1106
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,400
become you know and I know so much about

1107
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:53,358
all the other seed companies I mean you

1108
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,760
know the exaggerations that have put on

1109
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:58,279
and for some reason a lot of um people

1110
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,400
in the world believe that seed companies

1111
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,040
that have been in Holland for many years

1112
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,039
are all legal and they've been doing the

1113
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,039
right thing and and they've all not

1114
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:10,880
legal actually I mean seeds are made

1115
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:13,639
with growing higher THC than3 and that's

1116
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,400
still not legal you know um it's

1117
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:19,199
tolerated if you're not

1118
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:22,000
caught so uh unfortunately to this day

1119
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:24,598
that's the actual stance that still know

1120
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,159
they just they allow a little bit going

1121
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,480
on uh in in Holland and and so certain

1122
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,920
countries now because it's not really as

1123
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,519
dangerous as they probably thought and

1124
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,519
they probably preferred to get the

1125
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,719
electricity paid rather than stolen so

1126
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:41,400
you know the these things are now slowly

1127
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:44,318
coming to the serice 20 30 years but but

1128
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,160
most things I mean like there companies

1129
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,239
that say they were been established

1130
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,759
since 1985 or that there were no se

1131
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,759
companies in those days you know what I

1132
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,240
mean there were companies that happened

1133
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,000
in the '90s maybe Neville was one of the

1134
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,078
first ones I think in the late 80s

1135
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,519
anyway 80s

1136
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,880
788 um but you know it just there's a

1137
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:07,599
lot of fabrication to companies trying

1138
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,519
to merge into things but they've got no

1139
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,720
history behind them and if you check you

1140
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,599
realize that they're all exaggerating

1141
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:17,318
things so I don't know I don't really

1142
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,400
work live in that world anymore I prefer

1143
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:21,960
to live in our world and and and we just

1144
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,519
do whatever sort of job that we think is

1145
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,000
correct you know yeah that's awesome to

1146
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:28,759
hear and look a number of really awesome

1147
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,480
talking points you just mentioned I'd

1148
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,040
love to just quickly loop back you know

1149
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,960
because you mentioned the hash plant

1150
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:36,159
that you're familiar with is not really

1151
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,960
the one you see these days the The

1152
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,159
Cutting these days that gets discussed

1153
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,880
as the one that we think you may have

1154
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,719
been working with is people call it the

1155
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,160
p&amp;w hash plan do you know much about

1156
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:50,399
this and how would you describe the one

1157
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:53,239
that you worked with the the the one

1158
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,639
that I don't know what the BMW hashplant

1159
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:58,000
is I'm I'm not so I mean I'm on my own

1160
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:00,598
forum and I'm on my Instagram but I I

1161
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,480
don't really do too much social media um

1162
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,039
this is probably the third podcast in my

1163
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,280
life so you know what I

1164
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:10,480
mean um so I kind of maybe um um a bit

1165
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,040
ignorant about what everyone talks about

1166
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,039
but there um a lot of people weren't

1167
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,239
even born when when I had versions out

1168
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:21,119
you know what I mean so it's very

1169
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,838
difficult for them to know what very

1170
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,599
difficult for them to really understand

1171
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:27,920
they're only believing stories that have

1172
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:30,280
been passed down to them so let's just

1173
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,039
um acknowledge that that's okay and I'm

1174
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,800
not trying to say that anyone's got the

1175
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:37,440
wrong version or anything um it's just

1176
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,280
that um like the White Widow for example

1177
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,559
when we first made it we made White

1178
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,559
Widow and it was particularly this

1179
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:47,040
mother with this father people bought

1180
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:49,798
the S1 seed the uh and then next year

1181
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,838
every company had white widow but it

1182
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:53,559
wasn't the original version and many

1183
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:56,838
people think because it's called White

1184
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,720
Widow it's the heaning Well it's

1185
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:00,599
selection of the person who's doing the

1186
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,199
breeding then and it's slightly

1187
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:04,519
different it's like what we talked about

1188
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:06,598
with the wine making that if you put all

1189
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:09,000
the same tools together people select

1190
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:11,480
different ratios and different things in

1191
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,079
in you know that's just the

1192
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:18,400
individuality of of the person blending

1193
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:20,240
and uh and so for me our original um

1194
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,000
hash plant what it looks like is very

1195
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,598
strong very sturdy stem first of all

1196
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,599
really upright you don't need to stick

1197
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:30,880
it you don't need to uh uh hold it for

1198
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:34,838
weight or anything and then um it it

1199
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:37,240
grows very uh upright uh um stems where

1200
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,639
the flowers are on and it's a very it's

1201
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:43,558
a bit

1202
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:45,920
reddish reddish purple Maron Aura to it

1203
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:49,760
uh and it's very pungent it's got four

1204
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,400
different types of um indices involved

1205
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,960
in in in in the hash plant and uh like

1206
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,200
gravity that was the original um one

1207
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:02,000
part before we it was a plant that we

1208
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:04,838
made with series of indicas as well so

1209
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,519
that yeah we kind of and and one distin

1210
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:11,039
thing about the hash plant was what when

1211
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:15,280
it was flowering it made very yellow um

1212
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:17,920
um hairs at the exceptionally yellow was

1213
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,119
something you see with this reddish Aura

1214
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,440
kind of leaf and very strong stem and

1215
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,720
then a very yell yeah so yellow kind of

1216
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:30,599
hairs on flower so um that was the

1217
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:32,879
version what uh we've been working on

1218
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:36,680
for a while and we' selected and gone

1219
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,000
down the inbreed inbreeding Road for

1220
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:41,480
maybe three or four

1221
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,318
generations and I must say to everybody

1222
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,199
I mean once you buy seeds from different

1223
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:46,960
companies and you do three or four

1224
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,759
generation there has nothing to do with

1225
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,119
what it originally was it's pretty much

1226
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,839
to do with your selections and and then

1227
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,440
it

1228
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:57,239
becomes the origins is nice to know

1229
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,000
where they come from but it becomes

1230
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:02,358
yours then you have a claim to rename it

1231
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,119
in a way you know but not when you

1232
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:07,480
squirt gelato and then you know you do

1233
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,519
it with G Scout I mean you you're just

1234
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,880
reh hybridizing hybrids you know what I

1235
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,480
mean

1236
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,920
and that's mainly for flavors most of

1237
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,119
the time so I suppose you know the the

1238
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,480
American Market dictates a lot of things

1239
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:24,119
to um creates a a freny around things

1240
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,798
but a lot of it's to do with cush and

1241
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:30,119
skunk getting stoned and flavorsome you

1242
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:34,239
know and then um like you know that

1243
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:35,960
might be really good sort of for uh uh

1244
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:37,679
um for the majority of people in the

1245
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,280
States but over in Europe for example

1246
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,519
some people don't want to get too stoned

1247
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,160
but they like to have an uplifting

1248
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:47,000
effect and so they smoke a lot more

1249
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,199
sativa you know or the old school

1250
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,039
Californians or Hawaiians they were

1251
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,279
smoking a lot more sativ kind of

1252
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:56,159
influence plants so it's just it's

1253
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,040
different I mean there's no best one

1254
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,159
it's just

1255
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:02,199
they're all they're all damn good on a

1256
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:03,519
good day you know I like that sentiment

1257
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:05,558
that's beautiful and and you just

1258
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,000
touched on a topic which is really

1259
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:09,720
prevalent which is it feels like sativas

1260
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,559
are becoming less and less common or

1261
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,679
maybe less demanded do you feel like

1262
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,760
we're going to reach a point where

1263
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,118
sativas are almost impossible to find or

1264
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,440
do you think they'll always be a little

1265
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:24,480
group of die hards Oh They'll you know I

1266
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,519
mean most of our our our

1267
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,519
sales if if I going on is pretty much

1268
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,719
going back to hazes anything with the

1269
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:37,199
haze in the name we're selling um much

1270
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:39,480
more this year than ever before so um I

1271
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,199
think what happens is it you know

1272
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,039
there's cycles for fashion there's

1273
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:45,239
cycles for haircuts there's cycle for

1274
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,798
everything and eventually long hair

1275
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:49,919
comes back into fashion if you stay

1276
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:51,838
there long enough you know and uh uh I'm

1277
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,400
not saying anything about that but I

1278
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,480
mean I kind of just know that when you

1279
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,798
stick to something good um and you you

1280
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,639
continue to make it in in a good way

1281
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:05,719
there'll always be a market for it and

1282
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:08,480
um some people really don't like the The

1283
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:12,118
Psychotic that kind of it almost want to

1284
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:15,000
vomit throw up effect from hazes because

1285
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:17,480
some of them are very very from zero to

1286
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
100 you know and you you kind of um you

1287
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,280
know sometimes they're a bit off-putting

1288
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,239
for people who are very sensitive to um

1289
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,200
THC and so it's not for everyone but

1290
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:30,279
then other is nebiolo or or or you know

1291
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:33,480
tianello and you know some people like

1292
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:37,440
white wine Some people prefer French or

1293
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:40,000
champagne or Caro and it's just you know

1294
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,760
it's it's a I look at it as an

1295
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,719
individual medicine once you find a

1296
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,640
strain that really does something to you

1297
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:49,759
the Master Kush SC for example the

1298
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:52,960
Master Kush used to always make me very

1299
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,359
creative I would start writing I would

1300
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,440
drawing I would design things I I would

1301
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,960
you know and every time I use it it was

1302
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,200
always the same effect and I felt wow

1303
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:05,240
that was that's a really interesting and

1304
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:07,558
I start to use it for that um whenever I

1305
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:09,959
had to do something I I would go for the

1306
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,680
master uh as distinct from say early

1307
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,760
Queen would be a completely different

1308
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:17,279
effect another flavor completely

1309
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,200
different off the charts you know and so

1310
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,519
there was I mean I think there'll be

1311
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,519
always a market for hazes um and I think

1312
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:27,960
people are slowly getting a little bit

1313
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:29,400
you know sort of dizzy from

1314
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,159
um all of the things that are going

1315
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,000
around at the moment and and let's face

1316
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,519
it I

1317
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,358
mean it's very hard to replicate these

1318
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,039
things if you don't feminize them

1319
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:42,119
because there's there's not many people

1320
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:45,159
really being you know sort of doing

1321
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:49,358
research into you 100 variet 100 seeds

1322
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:53,440
of I don't know tsunami and 100 seeds of

1323
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:55,759
uh of gelato and then finding males and

1324
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,318
then seeing what happens to them they're

1325
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,240
mainly just squirting them with the

1326
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:02,199
Macho stuff and off we go you know what

1327
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,879
I mean and uh I don't think you really

1328
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:09,358
need I consider them producers of seed I

1329
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:11,760
don't consider them breeders so um again

1330
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,480
I'm just making definitions for myself

1331
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,640
to to how I I do my business with other

1332
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,199
people I mean a lot of seed companies

1333
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,039
come to us because they don't have the

1334
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:22,439
rooms and they want something produced

1335
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:24,920
and I would always do that and you know

1336
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,240
we agree on something if we had spare

1337
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,798
rooms going at one stage and you know

1338
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:31,798
that that's we we we did a lot of help I

1339
00:55:29,798 --> 00:55:34,480
don't do it so much anymore because I

1340
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:37,358
got burnt a few times but the thing is

1341
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,358
that uh you still try I mean it's silly

1342
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,038
not to try if you've got the opportunity

1343
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:43,558
and you'll never know what you learn

1344
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:46,079
from from things and you never know what

1345
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,039
doors open from when you think one door

1346
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,640
is opening maybe it was something

1347
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:52,280
completely different and you know if

1348
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:54,239
you're open to all of that you you'll

1349
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,880
you'll have no problem you know if

1350
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,919
you're not open to it don't start this

1351
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,680
job

1352
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,920
no we've we've certainly heard that

1353
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,480
sentiment before you know and uh you're

1354
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,440
you're right there is a big distinction

1355
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,079
between you know the the ways people

1356
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,798
made seed back in the day with larger

1357
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,760
numbers versus now I want to quickly ask

1358
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:13,960
you you mentioned you know hazes on the

1359
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,559
up and up in terms of popularity and

1360
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,199
I've certainly noticed this and I think

1361
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:20,280
part of the Allure is that unique high

1362
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:22,239
and specifically people always talk

1363
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,839
about how there's no seiling on the haze

1364
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,838
you know you just keep going if you keep

1365
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:28,199
hitting it and I guess my question would

1366
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:30,639
be why do you think some of the older

1367
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,199
more sort of special genetics have no

1368
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:34,318
ceiling whereas a lot of the newer stuff

1369
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:35,480
the gelato the cookies they don't have

1370
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,798
that like there's like a ceiling you

1371
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:42,559
just get to a point and that's

1372
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:46,119
it I don't think um when you when when

1373
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:49,160
you breed um when you make a selection

1374
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:51,119
from um um say land races originally you

1375
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:54,318
know let let's go right back to it I

1376
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:57,318
mean um you make a selection for a

1377
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:59,519
particular reason when in Mr nice we I

1378
00:56:57,318 --> 00:57:02,558
would look for the structure of the

1379
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:04,719
plant the stability um there's a few

1380
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,599
things that tell me it's stable and then

1381
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:10,558
I would start to go uh affect how does

1382
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,960
it affect me how does it look when we

1383
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,559
what's the yield how does it uh handle

1384
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:20,920
humidity uh various things like that and

1385
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:24,960
I would say that um we considered each

1386
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:28,200
trait before nowadays they're pumping it

1387
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,679
out so fast it's like banana with apple

1388
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:33,519
uh you make a new gel a new ice cream

1389
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:36,199
and then they're making flavors and then

1390
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:38,038
they're starting to bring in flavoring

1391
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:43,078
that's not naturally there and they

1392
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:45,799
start to and for me it's um it's discont

1393
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:49,200
control when it comes to that because

1394
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:51,880
you've you've only selected for one or

1395
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:54,879
two traits and not five or six trapes

1396
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:57,680
which used to be selected for and effect

1397
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,280
is one of those ones that I I consider

1398
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,038
i've smoked all of this new stuff we

1399
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,680
have a lot of it we make seeds for

1400
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:06,760
certain companies of this new stuff it

1401
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:09,558
looks nice it smells great they all look

1402
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,960
like um skunks and kushers and and

1403
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:16,760
different versions of that sort of kind

1404
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:21,400
of type of origin if I generally just

1405
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:22,839
say um um and for me they none none of

1406
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,720
them

1407
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:28,599
have made me want to go back and smoke

1408
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:31,598
them for effect they maybe

1409
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:34,079
flavor um and sometimes for couch lock

1410
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:37,200
you know I'm not a real big fan for that

1411
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:39,318
but sometimes it's funny to to kind of

1412
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:42,759
you know sort of go to sleep in a in a

1413
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:45,400
kind of narcotic state but um I would

1414
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,039
say that that the the general thing is

1415
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:51,240
that they're they're lacking in in trait

1416
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:53,400
selection and and so that's where you

1417
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:55,239
get a ceiling on the the I mean they're

1418
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,200
going up to 20 they're just trying to

1419
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:00,598
prove that they're so in TC but that's

1420
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:02,118
not what gets you stoned only you know

1421
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:04,200
it's

1422
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,358
everything and if you think about it

1423
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:09,318
Turpin are in such small quantities they

1424
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:11,880
must be so powerful you know much more

1425
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:14,838
powerful than a THC or a CBD uh

1426
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,680
component on a plan so the turban you

1427
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:21,038
you

1428
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:24,598
.006 Mill you know Mill milligrams on a

1429
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:26,920
thing has that effect if you put 0.008

1430
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:30,240
it changes it completely

1431
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,519
so turpens for me have they're used in

1432
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,919
such small concentrations for a reason

1433
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:36,798
you don't find plants with more than

1434
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,159
three I mean once you dry it around

1435
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:42,639
three 1 to 3% would be a Turpin profile

1436
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:46,639
that most plants would have in in

1437
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:48,000
concentration of Turin not 8 9 10 12 you

1438
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,759
know what whatever they're doing

1439
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,760
nowadays it's like you're you're super

1440
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:58,280
you know you're super pimping a plant

1441
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:00,799
flavor uh because you know the American

1442
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,559
Market wants to taste more and more and

1443
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,440
more

1444
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:09,240
Texas is not you know bigger is not only

1445
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,599
better we we things that are refined

1446
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:13,639
that have a flavor that have kind of a

1447
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,000
depth to it and have you know it's like

1448
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:18,519
wine again I I hate I don't mean to

1449
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
bring it up all the time but it I base

1450
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:22,838
it on wine olives and cannabis for me

1451
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,639
are the three most important plants in

1452
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:27,599
the world and they run together the

1453
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:29,719
olive come a little bit later than the

1454
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:33,640
wine but they I could grow them all

1455
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:35,118
together very comfortably and um and

1456
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:36,838
there's a lot of parallels in those

1457
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,798
Industries because when you taste

1458
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:40,599
certain olives of course you got flavors

1459
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,358
and you got low flavors and then you got

1460
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:46,200
very intense flavors and then you got

1461
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:48,440
different CH chemical components on on

1462
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:50,759
the olive oil and you know so when you

1463
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,679
start to look at agricultural products

1464
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,720
and then you understand um things like

1465
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,318
that then you'll see that that that's

1466
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,719
the

1467
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:00,558
then you understand what you're looking

1468
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,239
at for a change you know and then you

1469
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:06,440
start to go Ah that's the bit I like you

1470
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:09,199
know it's that better Carol is the

1471
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:12,079
Turpin that I I'm find that spicy kind

1472
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:13,919
of black peppery I like that and that's

1473
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,960
and then you start to pick things and

1474
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,440
you see it if you analyze all the plants

1475
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,159
you've selected you might see that

1476
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,880
they're quite ey in that particular

1477
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:25,639
Turon as well so yes there's a there's

1478
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,559
um with the tools that we've um we've

1479
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:29,440
advaned bed with and used right

1480
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:32,240
throughout the agricultural industry and

1481
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,119
adapted to cannabis we're definitely now

1482
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:37,159
exposing things that have been there but

1483
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:39,160
now we can see them we maybe you know

1484
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:41,598
they weren't in concentration that's why

1485
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:44,679
hashes for example where you

1486
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:49,200
concentrate a flowering field to just a

1487
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:51,639
particular condensed uh um resin gland

1488
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,558
pile of resin gland you get a much

1489
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:56,358
better understanding of that plant from

1490
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,599
making a small bit of hat

1491
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:01,278
and and the effect of the medium if it's

1492
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,079
from a sea crop for

1493
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:06,920
example so you know there's methods to

1494
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:09,680
this madness would you believe you

1495
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,358
know would you believe no I love that so

1496
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:13,960
much wisdom there I think we'll all have

1497
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:15,358
to go back and listen to that again and

1498
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,679
highly encourage everyone to check out

1499
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:20,159
gordal olives they changed my life I'm

1500
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:22,118
just going to quickly ask you because

1501
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,239
you mentioned it a few questions ago you

1502
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:26,318
spoke about the Mr Nice forums and I

1503
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:28,199
think these have to be a state people in

1504
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,440
the community over the years in terms of

1505
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:33,318
a place where people could go share

1506
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,318
knowledge find knowledge um lots of

1507
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:37,880
amazing posts on there I wanted to ask

1508
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:39,079
you how has it affected you running this

1509
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,680
forum over the years you know have you

1510
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:42,519
leared any cool things anything

1511
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:45,078
surprisingly come out of

1512
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:47,719
it I mean I

1513
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:50,400
um at right at the beginning I was doing

1514
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:52,679
on Heaven Stairway in Canadian for him

1515
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:57,318
one of I was one of the first breeders

1516
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:57,318
to be accessible all the time

1517
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:05,639
um I kind of started in the N late 90s

1518
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,119
being um moderating my own site and and

1519
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:09,679
and doing it from ourselves when

1520
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:12,680
Stairway to Heaven was bustered and they

1521
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:15,519
went um Richard went

1522
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:19,318
down um we all started to open up our

1523
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:20,798
own sites and that's when I I suppose um

1524
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:22,880
it was kind of ready when I left

1525
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:25,480
Greenhouse um and moved to Switzerland

1526
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,798
and then opened up Mr Nice already I

1527
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,960
opened up

1528
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:31,798
this um we started to do a website and

1529
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,760
then I realized how important it was to

1530
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:36,199
actually be accessible to talk to

1531
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,319
individuals who had relevant

1532
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:40,719
questions um they couldn't get that from

1533
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:46,558
a shop that was selling our seeds always

1534
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:48,759
so um uh and I prefer um one-on-one um

1535
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:51,119
at the end of if you speak to you know

1536
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,000
five people a day at the end of the year

1537
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:56,200
there's 1500 more people have'

1538
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,960
influenced and slowly after 100 thousand

1539
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:59,960
years you you've influenced a lot of

1540
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:03,880
people that's how long I feel like I've

1541
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:07,519
been doing it for but um I I think this

1542
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:11,000
The Forum was very essential uh still is

1543
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:13,000
um I tried to be laser fair with it and

1544
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,838
and allow people to police themselves or

1545
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,318
it got into a bit of problem when the

1546
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:20,000
community got too

1547
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:22,000
big uh over over sort of 50 Grand THS

1548
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,920
and then you start getting hecklers and

1549
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,920
you get people that are just there to

1550
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,079
disrupt and I don't know why I mean I

1551
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,519
don't have time to do that sort of thing

1552
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:33,200
I never even thought about but all of a

1553
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,759
sudden on the websites and social media

1554
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,719
you get things that you've never thought

1555
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,520
about and and you have to deal with them

1556
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:42,798
and uh luckily I've just got um really

1557
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:46,278
good Growers involved who try to keep it

1558
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:48,960
real and and now Musashi one of the mo

1559
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:52,119
the main moderator along with me on the

1560
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,720
site is um he's a he's he's older than

1561
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:57,440
me he's in his 70s he's a wonderful guy

1562
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:01,480
he's very feet on the ground balanced

1563
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:04,679
guy um sort of dilutes down any in-house

1564
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:08,240
arguing and keeps it real and relevant

1565
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:11,480
and so I expect that um you know as a

1566
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:15,278
community and and grows and and we get

1567
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:18,480
bigger as well as we're growing um you

1568
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:20,760
need to kind of um you know if you come

1569
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,719
into our house this is what the kind of

1570
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,200
limits here and then you have to do that

1571
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,798
and I never thought about those things

1572
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:29,278
before I didn't think limits but you

1573
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:32,079
know unfortunately everybody's different

1574
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:35,239
in this world and they don't all kind of

1575
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,119
see ey to eye so you know respectful

1576
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:40,000
let's just say I I like people to be

1577
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:42,599
respectful to each other whether they uh

1578
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,358
have completely different backgrounds

1579
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,079
you I have no problem with that I've

1580
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:48,639
never really been racist or sexist or

1581
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:51,599
anything like that I don't care as long

1582
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:54,400
as they can do the job I'm all is you

1583
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,160
know and for me that was always

1584
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,400
important and we de loyed every every

1585
01:05:57,159 --> 01:06:01,318
race

1586
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,400
every well there's only two Sexes as far

1587
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:04,759
as I'm concerned because I'm still

1588
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,720
breeding but you know that that you know

1589
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:11,000
xx and XY I call them and so I don't

1590
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:14,239
want to get involved in any of that but

1591
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,960
uh uh still to this day I'm uh you know

1592
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:19,759
I have to deal with that I don't have

1593
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,480
other things to deal with we kill that's

1594
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,480
good to hear your perspective and I I

1595
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,159
can certainly appreciate your sentiment

1596
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,159
about um you know people will come up

1597
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:28,118
with some

1598
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:29,879
talking points and ideas you'd never

1599
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:32,318
even considered once you've been exposed

1600
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,000
to enough of them but uh one of one of

1601
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:37,239
the the things I definitely wanted to

1602
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,880
ask you was um you know over the years

1603
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:42,399
I've seen a lot of people draw

1604
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,480
references to some of the much later

1605
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,119
posts that Neville made on the Forum and

1606
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,880
they would use screenshots and be like

1607
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:49,559
oh you know this says that you're like

1608
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,559
not you Shany is in like someone there

1609
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:51,960
talking to on the internet they'd be

1610
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,760
like well you're actually incorrect cuz

1611
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,119
Neville said this here and some of the

1612
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,640
stuff he said did go against the grain

1613
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,760
of what had been sort of accepted I

1614
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:01,440
guess from your point of view did did

1615
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,079
you see anything that you weren't quite

1616
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:07,440
sure was real or did it all check out

1617
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:10,200
from your point of view no uh you know

1618
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,920
um let's say that was po possibly a

1619
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:15,798
fault of my own because in in the when I

1620
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:18,039
finally got nille to become come in and

1621
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:20,759
and go online because he never he

1622
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:23,520
avoided that for years and years when he

1623
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,960
came in he

1624
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,679
um let's just think about the words he's

1625
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:33,519
not he was not the easiest guy to get

1626
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:35,838
along with always okay he was definitely

1627
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:38,400
um coming from he was slightly older

1628
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:42,599
than me but he he he come from a hard KN

1629
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:45,400
School uh he thought um the the

1630
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:48,838
community or the people it kind of um

1631
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:52,240
owed a little bit to him for more than

1632
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:55,719
what he he' received or what he' been

1633
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:59,519
sort of dealt out in in some of the UN

1634
01:07:55,719 --> 01:08:01,598
the problems he had early on um and so

1635
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:04,759
um I'm just setting the scene for that

1636
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,559
um it was kind of he had sometimes he

1637
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,799
had a little bit of a chip on his

1638
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:11,920
shoulder for certain things uh his

1639
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:13,960
information about um varieties and

1640
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,399
strains were usually always correct and

1641
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,198
there was a time when he started to

1642
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:22,439
diverge from us uh Howard and I went

1643
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:24,798
wanted invited him into the CBD crew at

1644
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:29,079
that stage he was still with us and he

1645
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:30,880
wanted to go one with socalled um seed

1646
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:33,519
donations he'd got from people over the

1647
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:36,560
years and he he was recreating higher

1648
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,239
THC stuff and he was in Australia and he

1649
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,960
was working with some and then it

1650
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:42,759
started to go a bit funny because he

1651
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:46,079
started to direct traffic towards what

1652
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:50,920
he believed to be the next new things

1653
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:53,238
and and he he was quite wrong uh and and

1654
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,798
made a lot of promises to people and and

1655
01:08:53,238 --> 01:08:59,959
maybe didn't come good with them and he

1656
01:08:55,798 --> 01:09:02,158
slowly made a few um people upset and um

1657
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,359
I had to take him off the moderation

1658
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:07,000
there and then we we split ways when we

1659
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:08,838
went into the CBD stuff because we

1660
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,679
concentrated on that or and he really

1661
01:09:08,838 --> 01:09:13,439
wanted I think he was living in Western

1662
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:15,600
Australia he went he he he got some

1663
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,838
contracts with some companies that were

1664
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,600
going into the Cannabis thing and then

1665
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:23,238
they never saw him they paid a lot of

1666
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:26,600
money and and he he um maybe was going

1667
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:29,198
downhill then um I I don't know the last

1668
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,920
part of I wasn't I I tried to talk to

1669
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:34,759
him a bit he he got a bit angry uh with

1670
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:38,399
myself because of how we had to go our

1671
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:40,399
own ways and um he never came back to

1672
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,479
Europe and um you know sort of

1673
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,599
maintained all of the the plant stock

1674
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:47,198
and the seed stock and I've been doing

1675
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:51,239
that since 2001 when he left kind of

1676
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:54,359
thing um so I don't know I mean it's

1677
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:57,158
difficult uh to understand what um he he

1678
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:59,399
he was probably at certain stage and I

1679
01:09:57,158 --> 01:10:02,319
wasn't really aware and his family were

1680
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:05,359
really quite aware about that um but I

1681
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:08,238
loved him he was a great guy he he was a

1682
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:10,880
Fountain of Knowledge for me and he was

1683
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,519
uh it was great to have a peer in that

1684
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,159
thing especially in a foreign country

1685
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,159
where we're both Australian you know was

1686
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:19,960
kind of just accidental you know was

1687
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:22,279
like I mean I always called I I I think

1688
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,600
I did a interview once with an Italian I

1689
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:27,800
called it how did they see me and I said

1690
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,840
it accidental hero we kind of felt like

1691
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,840
we were accidental Heroes because we

1692
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,400
didn't know where we came from it was

1693
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,000
all still illegal I mean we were

1694
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:37,359
criminals over there but we never

1695
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,198
thought that way unfortunately DeVille

1696
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,559
had that problem in in in Western

1697
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:45,039
Australia where they kept him there and

1698
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:48,440
then I I think uh then Ben dronis took

1699
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:51,600
over the castle and he was never really

1700
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:55,559
very fair in Neville's eyes what he did

1701
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:58,880
and so just it was the it was the the SE

1702
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:01,400
of of discontent unfortunately and you

1703
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:05,239
know I can't really talk for for Neville

1704
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:09,920
or or anyone else um but yeah we don't

1705
01:11:05,238 --> 01:11:12,959
we we we actually split at in the what

1706
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,000
20091 around that when CBD crew started

1707
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,319
to take

1708
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,198
off um and then I had to take him off

1709
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:21,519
the website as well I left everything up

1710
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:23,719
there I'm not a guy to to take down

1711
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,719
stuff and and try to pretend it didn't

1712
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:28,920
happen um but uh there is still very

1713
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,600
good stuff and and I don't know many

1714
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,960
people believe that they they knew

1715
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,520
Neville but they I don't

1716
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,198
think think they met him later on in

1717
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,320
life and you know maybe it was a

1718
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,559
different level we all changed in life

1719
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:44,840
and you know but I remember him well

1720
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,600
sorry no no no you're all good and that

1721
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,279
that's a that's a brilliant answer and

1722
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,639
you know we've we've been fortunate

1723
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:51,840
enough to speak to a few people who you

1724
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,199
know obviously didn't know him as well

1725
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,679
as you but knew him to an extent and

1726
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:57,079
they all sort of echoed a similar

1727
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:58,760
sentiment that um you know he at times

1728
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:01,600
he wasn't the most easiest guy to get

1729
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,840
along with so you know I've always

1730
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,400
discussed it as you know maybe there's

1731
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:06,159
an element of needing to separate the

1732
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:09,198
art from the artist sort of thing in a

1733
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:11,000
sense um but nevertheless let's loop

1734
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:12,919
back to just after those mullum days I

1735
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,719
want to know what was the progression to

1736
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,039
you packing your bags and heading to

1737
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:22,239
Europe and jumping head first into it

1738
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:24,639
all um you know I mean I I studied in I

1739
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:27,039
went to Hal College in Melbourne I came

1740
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:29,560
from a very different background

1741
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:33,439
and finished the Melbourne uni degree

1742
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:35,760
and and science degree and and then I um

1743
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:37,319
I was landscaping and I was traveling

1744
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,119
every for three months a year and I

1745
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:42,759
thought you

1746
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:45,119
know I'd bought a house and renovated it

1747
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:48,039
22 or something and I kind of done all

1748
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:50,639
the stuff that you meant to do and and

1749
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:53,399
and didn't really do it for me you know

1750
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:56,880
I thought I better I I suppose I had a

1751
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:59,359
bit of a kind of inquisitive mind and

1752
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,639
and I just every time I

1753
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:04,399
traveled it was like the University of

1754
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:07,719
life it would just open up experiences

1755
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:09,920
and people and and foods and and

1756
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:11,639
cultures and [ __ ] that you looked at a

1757
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,039
book but it was never the same you know

1758
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:16,880
it was like that was two-dimensional

1759
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:20,039
this was threedimensional and so I

1760
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:24,119
traveled um I just got addicted to the

1761
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:27,279
traveling and I wasn't meaning to become

1762
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:28,880
a a a a a marijuana breeder at any stage

1763
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:31,439
I just collected things that I liked

1764
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,920
along the way and then I didn't want to

1765
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:38,519
go home I started to

1766
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:41,199
um um collect rough stone Opal and and

1767
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:44,080
Sapphire and stuff in my colle while I

1768
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:46,719
was collecting seeds and fruit seeds and

1769
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:48,880
I started getting interested in in in

1770
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:51,760
gemstones and I ended up in jaur in

1771
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:54,760
India and I was I have um had a

1772
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:57,560
motorbike and I would employ a couple of

1773
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:00,039
guys we were cleaning up rough opal and

1774
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:04,080
selling it in the market there and and

1775
01:14:00,039 --> 01:14:05,679
that took me to um um to Amsterdam that

1776
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:07,279
was the reason why I went originally

1777
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,359
there because it was a very big colored

1778
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:13,119
Stone well known for being colored stone

1779
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:15,519
for gems and I went there for that

1780
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:18,158
reason with a bunch of colored stones

1781
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,679
cut and looking great down my pants and

1782
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:22,759
and went into Europe and and I started

1783
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:26,119
going around to jewelry places and I

1784
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:28,119
slowly uh met people in Amsterdam that

1785
01:14:26,119 --> 01:14:31,000
were definitely not like jewelry people

1786
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:32,719
in France or England they were pretty

1787
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,279
much into smoking and having a good time

1788
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:37,520
and drinking a beer and then talking

1789
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:39,119
about making new kind of settings and so

1790
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,840
a lot of people were smoking dope and I

1791
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:43,679
was smoking dope and then um we had

1792
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,079
friends that brought in different hashes

1793
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,480
from different countries and we'd all

1794
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:50,639
start talking and start exchanging and

1795
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:54,119
slowly buying and selling and wheeling

1796
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:56,560
and dealing and and because I had such a

1797
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:58,359
bunch of seeds I I kind of was in the

1798
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:02,000
back of the mind to eventually find a

1799
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:05,599
place to crack these open and um I

1800
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:09,279
suppose in the early 90s um um that's

1801
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,920
when it started to like a few found some

1802
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:14,639
people who were growing and

1803
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:18,199
then and then by I think it was 92 it

1804
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:22,719
was I met Arian and then by

1805
01:15:18,198 --> 01:15:24,799
94 we um we actually established the

1806
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,399
seed the greenhouse seed company and

1807
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,880
then 95 we won I didn't enter the first

1808
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:31,439
year I entered the second year and then

1809
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,199
we won with White Widow and white rhino

1810
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:36,879
and white shark and every year we

1811
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:39,519
started to until 98 when I I left and we

1812
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:43,079
won H and I tried we won about 11 out of

1813
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:46,400
13 cups that year so yeah we we kind of

1814
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:50,039
it was not a plan thing until we started

1815
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:52,638
to it started to show a clear road that

1816
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:54,679
this was able to be done in this was the

1817
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:55,960
right country to do it in and so Holland

1818
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:57,719
was

1819
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:02,158
absolutely wonderful for that but the

1820
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:04,439
rest of the world gave a big ground to

1821
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,559
you know sort of good base to understand

1822
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:08,960
people and and and different

1823
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,880
agricultures and and different cultures

1824
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,679
and then different things so it was it's

1825
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,600
very difficult to explain but I mean you

1826
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:19,158
know it was coming out of the washing

1827
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,239
machine specifically for that line you

1828
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,279
know what I mean and I came out and I I

1829
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:25,799
kind of knew when I started it that I

1830
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,519
love to do that so

1831
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,000
you know it was just like that that's

1832
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,320
brilliant and you you really solidified

1833
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,639
that you're a true collector we can add

1834
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:39,799
gemstones to the list I love that um I'd

1835
01:16:35,639 --> 01:16:41,440
love still have a l oh W there you go so

1836
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,600
I guess my question is you know would

1837
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:45,839
you say that that job at Greenhouse with

1838
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,079
Arian was sort of your first real

1839
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,600
industry job and how did you meet

1840
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:53,238
Arian um my my girl the girl that I was

1841
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,760
um going out with and she was a Dutch

1842
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:59,519
girl and she was doing um all of the

1843
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:02,760
Interiors uh helping Arian she was good

1844
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:06,159
friends with Arian and Brenda his wife

1845
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:08,800
and uh um we got friendly all four of us

1846
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:11,399
and we um he asked what what would be

1847
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,960
interesting to keep me in Europe at that

1848
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:14,559
stage and I said well if we set up a

1849
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,840
seed company it would be great I didn't

1850
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,280
really want to be um coffee shop owner

1851
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:21,199
or anything like that so I helped with

1852
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:23,439
buying materials you know he didn't

1853
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:25,399
really know black hashes and stuff and

1854
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:28,879
and so I would

1855
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:30,599
be you know sort of working parallel

1856
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:34,800
with that side of things and then

1857
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:36,639
probably um um he I convinced him to all

1858
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,480
four of us went into that at the

1859
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:41,520
beginning 94 I mean there there was a

1860
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:43,439
period of time when yourself AR in and

1861
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,960
Neville were working for Greenhouse I

1862
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,799
believe what was that like and what

1863
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:50,520
strains came out of that

1864
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:53,679
collaboration oh I mean um well let's

1865
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:57,360
just look at it like this I

1866
01:17:53,679 --> 01:18:00,039
mean I Aran had a coffee shop had had

1867
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:02,079
that time he had two or three uh I'd

1868
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:05,960
worked on the water and built a

1869
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:07,679
waterfall and I'd helped a lot with um

1870
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,079
building up those things and then buying

1871
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,399
stuff and Neville and I were growing

1872
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:16,399
separately it Neville was growing stuff

1873
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:18,599
and I was growing stuff and because we

1874
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:20,119
were pretty good at our things people

1875
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,159
didn't have these strains so we could

1876
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:23,920
offer them to Arian he would buy them

1877
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,559
and put them in the coffee shop in the

1878
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,520
menu and they would be the only place

1879
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:31,679
you could get them in Amsterdam so

1880
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:35,800
everyone slly super silver for example

1881
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,279
Master Kush uh um the our versions at

1882
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,440
that stage the White Widow the White

1883
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,719
Rhino that they call it medicine man now

1884
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:44,719
the shark

1885
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:46,439
and um and then uh I suppose they were

1886
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,158
the one El Nino was probably the last

1887
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:51,519
one I did at greenhouse and then I went

1888
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:54,879
to miss ice and we did critical math and

1889
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,639
continue so we kind of always grew and

1890
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,359
kept our mothers separate that was

1891
01:18:56,639 --> 01:18:59,960
another business so we were Growers and

1892
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:03,559
then we would offer the finished

1893
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:05,840
material to the coffee shop and because

1894
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,960
he paid better money than everybody else

1895
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,440
to get the first ride of refusal to see

1896
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:12,279
everything everyone wanted to sell it to

1897
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:15,439
the greenhouse but Neville and I we sold

1898
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:17,359
quite you know we set prices and AAS is

1899
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:19,279
they took twice as long than indas so

1900
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,519
we'd have to need twice as much money

1901
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:23,439
and that's how the price structure

1902
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:27,239
started to come out and you know sort of

1903
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:30,879
Dr kavor and strain came one time there

1904
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:33,279
and you Northern Light five Haze was in

1905
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:36,079
the mix there and so they were always

1906
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:38,599
50% sativas so they would be worth a

1907
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:41,359
little bit more value so say if the

1908
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:43,199
indicas um the ones are 6 to S week

1909
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,599
flowering ones the orange but and

1910
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:49,279
everything like that they were around

1911
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:52,079
say 6,000 gilders or 5 6,000 gilders

1912
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:55,198
then M's Haze which took double would be

1913
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:58,719
12,000 at cost to the coffee shop so we

1914
01:19:55,198 --> 01:20:03,079
were making huge money on one kilo

1915
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:05,480
then um and that that inspired people to

1916
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:08,319
sort of compete and and try to do a

1917
01:20:05,479 --> 01:20:10,678
better job and if you were able to sell

1918
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,880
stuff to uh these places at certain

1919
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:15,158
money that was bragging rights between

1920
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,760
the Growers and you know you got eight

1921
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:20,879
grand for that and not six grand like a

1922
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,719
commercial so it it improved the growing

1923
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,239
I definitely it was a it was a good

1924
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,600
thing for the whole industry in the '90s

1925
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:29,678
we were all doing it for the brotherly

1926
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:32,840
love and we made money of course we made

1927
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:34,719
money but it wasn't the focus uh we all

1928
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,760
knew we were going to sell it to one of

1929
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:39,679
the coffee shops but we wanted to aim

1930
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:42,800
for the highest price so I suppose it's

1931
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:44,719
like any agricultural of thing that um

1932
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,560
we started to compete Neville and I a

1933
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:50,079
little bit by by that time and and just

1934
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:53,120
uh you know he would he would Edge me

1935
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:55,158
out most of the time uh first and second

1936
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:57,599
many times you know kind of

1937
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:59,399
I edged him out before he started it was

1938
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,600
the white weow we would we came in and

1939
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:07,759
made our our name and then he started to

1940
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:11,440
come in and and bring in um super Haze

1941
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,840
and uh Norther Life Five Haze and uh

1942
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,919
various other things so I mean it was

1943
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:19,159
healthy competition let's say and we all

1944
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:21,158
became better Growers for it so uh and

1945
01:21:19,158 --> 01:21:24,039
then and then and then the coffee shops

1946
01:21:21,158 --> 01:21:26,000
had had products that they they were

1947
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:27,319
unique and so if you wanted them you

1948
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,920
have to go to that coffee shop so that

1949
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:32,599
was a benefit for them as well so it

1950
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,719
kind of benefited everybody that kind of

1951
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,920
dis I used to have I on my Mr ni said

1952
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:39,039
support disorganized crime because that

1953
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,359
was pretty

1954
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:44,800
much what we were we were there was no

1955
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:47,599
Mafia or anything like what people were

1956
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,279
romantically believed we were all uh all

1957
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:52,520
over the place mate and just don't get

1958
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:55,198
caught that was the that that was all

1959
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,920
that we we lived by don't get caught

1960
01:21:55,198 --> 01:22:01,039
don't let anyone follow you and and

1961
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:04,800
don't uh don't have any issues so uh

1962
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:06,359
thank you brilliant oh look I love that

1963
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,520
motto that's that's brilliant support

1964
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:10,799
disorganized crime so I guess I'd be

1965
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,159
wondering um when when did you meet I

1966
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,440
have the other one on the backside it

1967
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:15,439
said permanent state of

1968
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:20,639
temporary next time they missed a nice

1969
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:22,119
t-shirt that we used to make oh there

1970
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:25,079
you go I love it we need to bring it

1971
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:27,439
back so so what was your introduction to

1972
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:31,079
Howard and how did you springboard from

1973
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:36,000
that point to Making Mr Nice with him

1974
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:38,639
um a girl she's um from a mixed race

1975
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,960
family from England she came over and

1976
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,920
was became a client and was used to buy

1977
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,840
four or five kilos of different

1978
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,760
marijuanas from us from me specifically

1979
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,360
and we became friendly and I found out

1980
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,360
that her father was a cop in England and

1981
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,238
I kind of said well how did you get into

1982
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:58,079
there she said yeah well I read this

1983
01:22:55,238 --> 01:23:00,279
book and and then one time she came over

1984
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:03,399
with it and gave me the book I didn't

1985
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:05,119
know anything about this guy and it was

1986
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:07,399
must have been around

1987
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:09,479
95 and I started reading the book

1988
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:11,039
couldn't put it down [ __ ] read the

1989
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:14,879
whole thing and it was

1990
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:17,399
like and I realized I met this guy at

1991
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:20,560
the High Times Cannabis Cup and he was

1992
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:23,638
talking to me in this strange accent

1993
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,560
Welsh and and we hit it we were we just

1994
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:28,880
had a funny

1995
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:31,840
um um Rapport and

1996
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:34,880
um and then the next year he came over

1997
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,360
to the Milky and we actually we won a

1998
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:40,400
lot of things and he

1999
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:43,679
said um he asked me if if an old bloke

2000
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:46,599
like him had any chance to to start up

2001
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:48,880
um a business together and then I said

2002
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,960
to him I know who you are and then I and

2003
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,440
then we started talking and then he he

2004
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,560
just got out of jail in America it was

2005
01:23:53,439 --> 01:24:01,879
96 think it was very early just very

2006
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:05,360
early on and and and I was uh 95 96 yeah

2007
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:08,239
96 I think and we just hit it off he was

2008
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:11,679
just the nicest the most intelligent

2009
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:14,718
gentleman's gentleman I any have high

2010
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:17,279
high regards and high praise for him

2011
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:20,158
because he was a he was absolutely

2012
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:24,439
lovely partner and he was a wonderful

2013
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:26,399
human being and um I really enjoyed and

2014
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:28,559
fact got inspired to make the seed

2015
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:31,559
company work so we had more reasons to

2016
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:34,239
bump into each other and expose and and

2017
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:37,159
spend time together so actually we

2018
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:39,039
weren't we weren't uh sort of motivated

2019
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:41,198
by the big bugs and all of that we were

2020
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:44,679
more motivated by getting together to

2021
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:46,279
get few beers and get stone together and

2022
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,760
that became you know sort of quite

2023
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:50,599
regular at a certain stage and then we

2024
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:54,639
got jobs for talking and and doing the

2025
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:57,280
Expo uh lectures and stuff and

2026
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,560
and uh we had a good time it was just a

2027
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:03,639
I met him through this girl who was

2028
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:05,480
smuggling um back to England and by by

2029
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:10,000
chance she gave me the book and so that

2030
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:11,638
was a kind of um it was no no wonderful

2031
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,479
outrageous story but it was a funny

2032
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:16,920
story because she contacted me just

2033
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:18,718
recently after many years of not seeing

2034
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,679
her she said you probably don't remember

2035
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:24,039
me but I'm this lady and and of course I

2036
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,158
did and she she asked me she was living

2037
01:25:24,039 --> 01:25:28,920
in Germany now and she's asking me about

2038
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:30,000
things and it's funny I I have that kind

2039
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,840
of

2040
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,479
um um I lost a lot of contact with many

2041
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:38,920
people due to experiences in life and

2042
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:41,238
and and then re got it back later on

2043
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:42,719
when things became an industry you know

2044
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:46,279
what I mean people started to come out

2045
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:49,319
of the woodwork and and be seen I

2046
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:51,479
always as how it said we were

2047
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:55,599
unsuccessful criminals because we got

2048
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:57,638
caught and so we became we became kind

2049
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,320
of faces and before that we were

2050
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:02,319
invisible and we could do everything so

2051
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:04,118
once you become a face you have to

2052
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:06,039
changed your job you know what I mean

2053
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:09,759
and like Consulting at least not

2054
01:26:06,039 --> 01:26:12,118
touching it every day so for me I I I

2055
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,960
just made it into the medical

2056
01:26:12,118 --> 01:26:18,079
market so we can make it into a job and

2057
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:21,279
and that's been Focus for the last since

2058
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:24,519
the CBD crew I suppose yeah brilliant

2059
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:26,439
story there love to hear that so uh I'd

2060
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,159
love to quickly ask you before we look

2061
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:30,439
at getting into some of our final

2062
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,399
questions what would be your advice for

2063
01:26:30,439 --> 01:26:34,638
an aspiring breeder someone who wants to

2064
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,879
get into the scene but wants to do it

2065
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:41,279
right well I mean you

2066
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:46,679
know I don't know

2067
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:49,158
um I think a lot of a lot of um my story

2068
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:50,760
uh in this world is probably timing and

2069
01:26:49,158 --> 01:26:53,879
and I was at the right place and the

2070
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,719
right time and I I I do believe there

2071
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:58,199
are are the people out there that have

2072
01:26:55,719 --> 01:27:01,800
definitely as good goods and and have

2073
01:26:58,198 --> 01:27:03,960
worked on certain lines as and are very

2074
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,880
private and there's definitely some

2075
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,158
excellent people out there that have got

2076
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:11,000
some

2077
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:13,079
gems um however uh to bring it to the

2078
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,520
the public is a very different game you

2079
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:19,079
know you have to be ready to to cop

2080
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:22,400
criticism and and go through a lot of uh

2081
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:25,840
regulatory bodies and and things so to

2082
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:27,960
do it legally nowadays is is kind of um

2083
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:32,800
it's a wonderful thing it's a great

2084
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:36,079
thing um black was much easier I must

2085
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:39,800
say white is more red tape and blue tape

2086
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:42,760
and green tape uh but with licensing uh

2087
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,679
comes um um proudness of what you're

2088
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:49,039
doing and and and holding your head up

2089
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:51,679
high and so breeding is yet to be I

2090
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:55,158
wouldn't say that it's a um it's a sort

2091
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:58,840
after job cultivating has a sort after

2092
01:27:55,158 --> 01:28:03,719
job um at recently but I believe that

2093
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:06,560
that eventually the that will go back to

2094
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:10,319
what will make this company different is

2095
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:12,280
the the variety or the effect of the

2096
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,840
particular plant they've developed in

2097
01:28:12,279 --> 01:28:16,759
house and it's only available there and

2098
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,840
that will be the Discerning factor

2099
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:22,679
between companies in the future not just

2100
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:25,360
producing cannaboid and and sort of

2101
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:28,000
regurgitating the same stuff you're

2102
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:30,238
going to have to have something special

2103
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,960
and so I believe breeders will will come

2104
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:36,839
back into being um eventually maybe not

2105
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:39,439
for every company but you know for for

2106
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:42,360
many yeah hopefully that's some some

2107
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:44,559
great advice there so moving on to our

2108
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:47,880
final five quickfire questions we'd love

2109
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:50,000
to ask guests the first one is what's

2110
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,480
your favorite creation that you've made

2111
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,079
and then as a followup what's a creation

2112
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:54,799
you're fond of that was made by someone

2113
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:56,359
else

2114
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,800
um my

2115
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:02,118
favorite to this day is mango Haze um

2116
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:04,760
there's no doubt that uh I put a lot of

2117
01:29:02,118 --> 01:29:06,799
time and effort into that and I really

2118
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:10,400
when I have it uh I smoke it straight

2119
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:12,560
away so I mean Pro proofs in if we have

2120
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:15,039
10 different marijuanas on the table the

2121
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,960
first one that's used is the popular one

2122
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:20,198
and that's usually mango ha that's how I

2123
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:22,600
Work It Out second mean it would be very

2124
01:29:20,198 --> 01:29:24,638
close to Neville's ha and Super Silver H

2125
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:28,159
so all of them are up there

2126
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:30,000
and then um so so that would be one of

2127
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:33,439
the ones that I would reach for if it

2128
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,560
was in in the tin um what was the second

2129
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:37,439
part of the question uh what's a

2130
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:39,719
creation you're fond of that was made by

2131
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:43,158
someone else oh well I mean Neville I

2132
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:47,960
mean you know I had I had the the best

2133
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:52,039
guy to be a sort of mentor and I suppose

2134
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:54,198
the Dr kavarian would be it's I've got

2135
01:29:52,039 --> 01:29:57,279
it in seed but I don't have it uh in the

2136
01:29:54,198 --> 01:30:00,759
living plant but I I um it was another

2137
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:04,439
one of super silver haze mango Haze and

2138
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:07,039
Dr gavorin were all in the the work we

2139
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:08,960
were doing together separately together

2140
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:11,319
uh and just bouncing off each other's

2141
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:15,719
idea and I always loved that strain it

2142
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:17,479
was just so different aromatic and it's

2143
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:20,239
like Neville's Haze and Super Silver ha

2144
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:22,359
and mango ha together it was kind of uh

2145
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,718
it was it was amazing inspiring piece of

2146
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:27,439
work that one and fortunately

2147
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:30,639
we have to recreate it will take quite

2148
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:32,759
some searching but I mean I remember

2149
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:35,520
driving back with uh we had to move a

2150
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:39,079
room really quickly um and it was uh

2151
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,560
full of Dr gavar Neville cut it down dad

2152
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:43,519
my father was with me and we were in a

2153
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,760
small Panda or something we drove down

2154
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,600
to his place loaded up the car with

2155
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,840
green plants I mean that was huge that

2156
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:53,320
six foot plants and it stunk I mean I

2157
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:56,039
took the whole room in this small Baner

2158
01:30:53,319 --> 01:30:59,840
me and my father who's not into that

2159
01:30:56,039 --> 01:31:02,639
world at all drove like 150k back to

2160
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,679
hang it up in our thing and I think the

2161
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,719
effect of the smell got us so high and

2162
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:09,440
it was just such a bonding experience to

2163
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:12,118
have with my my late father it was it

2164
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:15,000
was great by the end of it he loved the

2165
01:31:12,118 --> 01:31:17,559
smell so just shows you you know he can

2166
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,479
change he was always very supportive

2167
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,679
anyway and was a good friend of Howards

2168
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:23,559
so it

2169
01:31:20,679 --> 01:31:25,960
was it was the Apple do fall far from

2170
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,199
the tree sort of me oh what a what a

2171
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,760
beautiful story I love it and out of

2172
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:31,519
curiosity just because I'm I'm actually

2173
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,719
not familiar with the Dr gavor and

2174
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,040
strain is that from the same um genetics

2175
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:38,399
that the mango Haze and the Neville's

2176
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:41,800
Haze came from yeah they were very very

2177
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:45,399
much um it was just a different c a

2178
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:49,079
different uh sister selected and then

2179
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:50,879
bread and then flowered on so at at one

2180
01:31:49,079 --> 01:31:53,279
stage we were doing we going through all

2181
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,639
of the I think we went through I think

2182
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:57,079
Neville

2183
01:31:54,639 --> 01:32:00,960
must have gone through a thousand seeds

2184
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:05,238
to find super silver ha mango Hayes we

2185
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:07,279
went through hundreds and Dr kalkin was

2186
01:32:05,238 --> 01:32:08,678
also one of the ones that we'd found

2187
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:10,118
well one of the ones that Neville had

2188
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:13,480
found along the way and then we started

2189
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:15,118
to flower it and it was just it was a it

2190
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:17,879
was not an indoor plant but we did an

2191
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:20,799
indoor room and it just everybody loved

2192
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:24,400
it I mean it went out pretty quickly

2193
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:26,840
so just some of those we we had a lot of

2194
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:30,359
access to many of those kind of strains

2195
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:33,239
that no longer exist and um you know in

2196
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:34,679
retrospect that they they taught you

2197
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:37,559
something to make sure that you kept

2198
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:39,399
backups and learn how to do mothers and

2199
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:41,199
cloning and and then you would flower

2200
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:42,960
them out and then you flow them two or

2201
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:44,638
three times to make sure that they were

2202
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:48,279
exactly what you're thinking they were

2203
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:50,639
and they were usually so yeah I mean it

2204
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:55,359
was it was definitely from the same line

2205
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:56,880
same time and same same sort of Haz Haze

2206
01:32:55,359 --> 01:33:00,759
combination with Northern Lights and

2207
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:02,760
skunk and they were those combinations

2208
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:06,000
still to me their building blocks to

2209
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,719
this day of you know sounds incredibly

2210
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,679
special I guess we can only hope to try

2211
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:11,760
it ourselves one day so we've spoken

2212
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:13,359
about some really Stellar examples I

2213
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,159
want to know on the other end of the

2214
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,238
spectrum what's something that really

2215
01:33:15,158 --> 01:33:20,319
caught on with the masses but when you

2216
01:33:17,238 --> 01:33:24,039
tried it never really spoke to you I

2217
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:26,000
suppose um

2218
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:28,359
there's been a lot of those strains that

2219
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,520
other companies uh felt really good

2220
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:33,559
about and um they didn't really rock my

2221
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:37,000
world and

2222
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:39,520
um um I'm I'm good friends with most of

2223
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,600
them I don't really want to say

2224
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:45,639
that um

2225
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:47,920
but like just now with all of these um

2226
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:50,600
all of these these things these cookies

2227
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:52,480
and I'm not a really big fan for all of

2228
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,800
that I mean it doesn't like you said

2229
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:57,879
mentioned earlier that it's got a

2230
01:33:54,800 --> 01:34:00,639
limited effect and and I I do eventually

2231
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:03,239
smoke for effect and and these don't

2232
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:04,880
really rock my world either you know and

2233
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:06,759
and as much as they're wonderful to

2234
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,600
smell and they're lovely to look at and

2235
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:12,239
they're very dense and everything's good

2236
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:14,440
about three out of five traits but you

2237
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:17,879
know I think that hasn't really

2238
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:19,919
impressed me o overly but I mean I

2239
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:22,440
listen if I didn't have anything I'd be

2240
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:24,760
very happy to be given a bud you know

2241
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:26,638
what I mean so it's it's not like I'm

2242
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:29,400
I'm humble always when it comes to that

2243
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,840
and there's no best one on a certain day

2244
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:33,479
I'll probably find the things that I'm

2245
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:36,760
you know sort of criticizing might

2246
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:38,559
really turn me on if I'm in the mood so

2247
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:40,960
it's very difficult it's a very

2248
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,520
difficult question I'm afraid no no

2249
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,239
that's a that's a good answer and I can

2250
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:46,480
completely agree some days things speak

2251
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:47,638
to you more than others so the next

2252
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:49,439
question is I'm going to drop you on a

2253
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:50,880
desert island what three things are you

2254
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:52,079
going to take it could be a cutting or a

2255
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,400
pack of seeds if you want to do some

2256
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:56,559
breeding what are you in for

2257
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:59,839
well I mean if I had a that I would take

2258
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,840
a pure a pure Haze and a pure indica and

2259
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,639
a pure skunk and I I think I could make

2260
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:08,279
pretty much the the rest of my PL my

2261
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:13,118
world um flower let's say but if I just

2262
01:35:08,279 --> 01:35:17,198
had to pick a seed seed take um I I I

2263
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:19,920
would definitely um I would I'm one of

2264
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:22,079
these guys that have always had a pure

2265
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,480
extremes so the the mother and the

2266
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:26,079
father would be very pure and then I can

2267
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:27,879
make pretty much everything in the

2268
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:30,840
middle and so I've always kind of

2269
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:34,719
thought that way um same with the CBD

2270
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:37,000
crew came about by that but I suppose I

2271
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:41,039
would have to take mango hay I would

2272
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:43,118
have to take nordal or critical mass

2273
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,198
would would be because critical mass has

2274
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:47,319
changed the I mean it changed a lot of

2275
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:49,839
people and they're all still using it

2276
01:35:47,319 --> 01:35:52,679
but Nal which was super skunk Afghan

2277
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:54,880
skunk um it's the one that Howard

2278
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:57,800
changed the name he wanted to name one

2279
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:00,679
after his book in in the book he refers

2280
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:03,840
to the code name of marijuana was nordal

2281
01:36:00,679 --> 01:36:06,719
so he wanted that to be uh go down in

2282
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,480
history so I that's a very good strain

2283
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:11,319
um and that was very fast fling so I

2284
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:14,039
wouldn't have to wait too long to be

2285
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:16,158
smoking if I was on a desert island I

2286
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:18,880
could get one and then the other one bit

2287
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:23,039
later and I then mix it up I would

2288
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:25,079
probably um Master Kush has always been

2289
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:27,359
absolute favorite as I said it was a

2290
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:29,880
very creative effect and I suppose if

2291
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:32,079
you can blend that with some of the haze

2292
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:35,359
things and then some of the the skunk

2293
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:37,118
and Afghan kind of facets you'd have um

2294
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:39,118
enough to live happily ever after on

2295
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:41,559
this little desert island hopefully it

2296
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:43,319
was big enough to to do a couple of

2297
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:46,719
crops a

2298
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:49,399
year you know I could I make some seeds

2299
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:51,760
and have my protein so I think I could

2300
01:36:49,399 --> 01:36:53,158
survive there yeah yeah I love it I love

2301
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,600
it there's conveniently there's a

2302
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:57,158
lifetime supply of fertilizer there for

2303
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,920
you so it all works

2304
01:36:57,158 --> 01:37:03,238
out um so final question for our chat

2305
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:05,520
today if you had to restart Mr Nice with

2306
01:37:03,238 --> 01:37:09,319
just one pack of your own stock what

2307
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:12,440
pack would you use Afghan Hayes

2308
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:15,559
beautiful what draws you to it well it's

2309
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:19,118
the building block of nearly every kind

2310
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:22,239
of 5050 a haze and and

2311
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:26,599
sativa um I still find it to be one of

2312
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:30,118
the most reli strains in our camp along

2313
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:34,239
with Ash um Afghan Haze by Afghan

2314
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:38,238
skunk you know so those ones I can uh I

2315
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:41,079
can get if you look towards the extreme

2316
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:42,799
sides the hay side I could definitely

2317
01:37:41,079 --> 01:37:45,118
find something towards like Neville

2318
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,719
Hayes and on the other side I could

2319
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:51,799
definitely find some very fast flowering

2320
01:37:47,719 --> 01:37:53,560
Afghan fruity strong narcotic things so

2321
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:56,960
you know Afghan haes is a very big

2322
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:59,119
building block for me and I I think we

2323
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:02,039
make it available to on the auctions on

2324
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:03,679
our website for many members and and and

2325
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:06,399
I think a lot of people would agree with

2326
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:08,880
that as well yeah no i' I've tried a few

2327
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:10,719
samples of uh the Angel Hayes and a few

2328
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,279
other crosses it's used in and it's uh

2329
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:14,920
gorgeous stuff so I think that just

2330
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:16,599
about brings us to the end of it for

2331
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:18,440
this one we we'd love to get you back on

2332
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:19,679
but as always any comments or shoutouts

2333
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:23,919
you'd like to

2334
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:25,599
make no just um you you're predominantly

2335
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:29,399
I suppose you have a lot of english-

2336
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:32,639
speaking Australian audience so I just I

2337
01:38:29,399 --> 01:38:36,238
mean I'm hoping that we're starting to

2338
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:40,199
export from Switzerland um our flowers

2339
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:43,759
to uh to Australian medical um um

2340
01:38:40,198 --> 01:38:46,118
company uh probably in January we we get

2341
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:49,079
all the permissions and and I will

2342
01:38:46,118 --> 01:38:53,839
have uh I think Super Silver Haze

2343
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:55,639
critical mass the original [ __ ] and uh

2344
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,119
pink lemonade one of the ones I've been

2345
01:38:55,639 --> 01:39:00,359
playing with a little bit those four

2346
01:38:58,118 --> 01:39:04,039
will soon be available as flower dried

2347
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:05,639
flowers from um um foka it's a company

2348
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:09,760
that we work with in

2349
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:12,199
Melbourne um exclusively and um I

2350
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:13,880
they've they've been really good um in

2351
01:39:12,198 --> 01:39:16,638
the sense that we've been working with

2352
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:18,639
them already on CBD but I'd like to give

2353
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:20,840
a shout out for the people in Australia

2354
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:23,880
whove been asking me where eventually

2355
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:26,440
can we try some of those flowers

2356
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:29,319
um that will be the the thing um

2357
01:39:26,439 --> 01:39:31,238
hopefully uh everything will be checked

2358
01:39:29,319 --> 01:39:34,000
by me before it leaves switzland for

2359
01:39:31,238 --> 01:39:35,479
sure so I can guarantee you that there

2360
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,599
will be good representation and

2361
01:39:35,479 --> 01:39:40,559
originals from the original plans but i'

2362
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:42,079
just like to say thank you to yourself

2363
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,960
uh for spending the time I I don't

2364
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:46,639
normally do these things as I said but I

2365
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:49,679
I kind of I realize how important it is

2366
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:52,359
for people to um learn some historic

2367
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:53,719
references as well and and kind of get

2368
01:39:52,359 --> 01:39:55,598
an understanding from some someone who

2369
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:57,599
was there and and you know you don't

2370
01:39:55,599 --> 01:39:59,840
have to believe everything I say but

2371
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:02,319
that was the account according to me and

2372
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,159
and so I hope you you do well with your

2373
