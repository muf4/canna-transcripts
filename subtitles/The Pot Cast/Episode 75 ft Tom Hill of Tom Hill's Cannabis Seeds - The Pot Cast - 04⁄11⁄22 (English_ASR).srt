you smoking on today

95
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,798
oh some something a neighbor brought by

96
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,238
um

97
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,799
I don't even know what the hell it is

98
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,319
but it's really really good and I'm

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,480
gonna have to ask him you know he's uh

100
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,339
one of these guys that

101
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,798
knows what he's doing

102
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,420
and when when you know neighbors are

103
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,760
always bringing over their best buds to

104
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,559
show off around here and when this guy

105
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,199
comes over you you know it's going to be

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,478
really good and it is

107
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,519
that sounds incredible I know that you

108
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,099
live in like NorCal where you know

109
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,918
there's a lot of serious Growers do uh

110
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,360
The Growers out there grow a variety of

111
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,978
different strains or do they tend to

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,360
stick to like the tried and tested

113
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,879
things

114
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,160
well you know I think uh

115
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,978
the majority of anybody that's doing any

116
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,740
growing these days is uh is

117
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:43,019
unfortunately you know trying to trying

118
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,759
to grow for for the market you know the

119
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,939
buyers and such

120
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,500
and uh and that that's getting a bit old

121
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,139
[Laughter]

122
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,300
yeah I can imagine especially given you

123
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,918
know your history of lines so is it

124
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,079
sativa dominant is it in the good

125
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,779
dominant give me an idea about it oh

126
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,800
it's probably some hybrid of unknown you

127
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:06,959
know it's and it's probably unknown uh

128
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,400
uh but it's certainly sativa leading in

129
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,180
its head

130
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,519
ah you know a very very heady uh

131
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,680
the cerebral High

132
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,019
that's interesting I like that and I

133
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,300
mean out of curiosity have you tried any

134
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,159
varieties in the recent past that are

135
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,180
like newer Creations that have impressed

136
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,240
you

137
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,180
I'm sure you know [Â __Â ]

138
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,699
I don't uh yeah some of this gelato 33

139
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,660
that I just smoked it doesn't taste very

140
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,220
good

141
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,780
um you know or not but it's not super

142
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,180
loud or anything you know it doesn't

143
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,959
taste bad there's just you know it's not

144
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,900
it's not super uh flavorful but it it

145
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,180
has a really has a really good heady you

146
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,579
know cerebral high that I liked a lot

147
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,879
um other oh geez you know I love the

148
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:55,620
triangle Kush and and uh you know that

149
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,000
that can be some pretty impressive herb

150
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,978
as well

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,839
beautiful I'm so glad to hear you

152
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,478
mentioned the TK because that is also

153
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,399
definitely one of my favorites have you

154
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,959
ever wanted to work with some of those

155
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,120
more modern lines not just to grow them

156
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,359
but maybe toy around making some seeds

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,759
with them oh yeah I grew up in TK and

158
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,520
you know I know those guys some of them

159
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,280
personally that kind of circle that's

160
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,959
been holding it up there in NorCal for a

161
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,939
long time and um

162
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,978
I grew it out I don't know maybe 10

163
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,800
years ago or something and I tried to

164
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:30,839
flip it and failed

165
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,240
I had him in a greenhouse and it was

166
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,758
just too humid and I was busy with other

167
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,460
stuff and I didn't didn't really you

168
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
know probably try as hard as I as I

169
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,379
should have but yeah I couldn't get any

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,060
pollen off of them

171
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,219
ah okay yeah cool so you wanted to

172
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,439
reverse it onto some other stuff what do

173
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,620
you think it might pair well with

174
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:56,100
oh damn near anything well

175
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,160
I take my friend up there at TSI has it

176
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,220
right you know it it it's it seems to be

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,560
an excellent parent uh have excellent

178
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,160
General combining ability across a broad

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,399
range of of other plants

180
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,660
yeah hugely I uh I think TK is

181
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,818
definitely up there with some of the

182
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,100
best breeding plants I've ever heard of

183
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,139
or come across what do you think a

184
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,819
hybrid with Haze would look like with

185
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,579
the TK I'm not sure if it's been done

186
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,460
but it would be cool in my opinion yeah

187
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,079
that would be worth a look for sure uh

188
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,079
you know I'd cross Haze with anything

189
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,978
though

190
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:36,538
and nothing at the same time you know

191
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:39,000
what a what a great answer there so

192
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,399
let's go down that rabbit hole a bit a

193
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,339
lot of people are very keen on your Haze

194
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,959
and your Haze experiences can you just

195
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,579
to start off we've had a number of

196
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,019
guests over the past few episodes talk

197
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,758
about Haze and one of the common things

198
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,098
they talk about is that there's so many

199
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,520
different hazes out there so what to you

200
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:59,038
is haze

201
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:02,219
well you know I mean I know I know a lot

202
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:04,740
of them uh there's one the old one that

203
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,020
I grow from positronics uh you know that

204
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,400
phase to me for sure but it's very

205
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,240
different

206
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,120
um

207
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,460
from like the Northern Light caves and

208
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,500
stuff that's you know and that stuff can

209
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:20,038
be can be just killer and rip your head

210
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:23,339
off too you know some of Neville's work

211
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,860
um but uh they're both Haze to me and

212
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,679
and I like them both and you know I just

213
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,180
I work with the one that that I prefer

214
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,120
the most

215
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,860
yeah sure and and in terms of like the

216
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,740
effect is it like that really

217
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,959
stimulating cerebral is it like paranoia

218
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,719
like what sort of effect do you like the

219
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,739
most out of haze

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,500
um

221
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:51,659
it it's very very potent and um and yeah

222
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,639
to where you have to laugh at yourself

223
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,259
you know because you're tripping you

224
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,039
know peeking out the window and stepping

225
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:02,000
here and [Â __Â ] and um

226
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:05,458
uh it's kind of it's a shockingly

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,799
incredibly potent and cerebral High

228
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,719
and I and I enjoy that you know I mean

229
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,519
that that stuff's gonna disappear before

230
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,259
I even touch anything else when I come

231
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,659
across a good one

232
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,519
I love that right like the first jar to

233
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,980
go empty that's a that's a sign of true

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,500
quality oh yeah I'll take that over a

235
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,240
lab any day

236
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,000
beautiful beautiful so I mean it's

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,278
probably a hard question to ask but what

238
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,940
what is your favorite Haze hybrid you've

239
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,939
done thus far

240
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,019
um

241
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,940
I've seen some really good when paired

242
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,919
with the Deep chunk the f2s are worth

243
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,200
looking through

244
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:46,079
um my neighbor gave me and another guy

245
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,940
gave me some of that a couple weeks back

246
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,700
that was incredibly good

247
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:55,019
beautiful that's the the monkey Haze

248
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:58,200
yeah yeah that yeah the DC Hayes uh

249
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:01,139
crosses that I think we did him and or

250
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,459
restarted anyway in Spain back in 09 I

251
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,100
think it was

252
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,599
ah that Infamous Spain run can you tell

253
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,940
us about that because I think a lot of

254
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,278
people including myself saw the Forum

255
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,260
post some really captivated by the

256
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,939
documentation you did how did that all

257
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,799
go down

258
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,240
oh um

259
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,639
let's see

260
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,019
are you you know Rocco my friend Rocco

261
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,699
there and Spain's always been a good

262
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,419
friend and Charlie and doobie and all

263
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,240
those guys you know on the on the in

264
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:32,519
Spain and at the time

265
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,899
uh I had passed out a bunch of seeds and

266
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,639
you know I've been I was just giving

267
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,039
away seeds and such

268
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,039
and uh and I got tired of that

269
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,299
and it was just kind of a way to uh you

270
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,480
know to not have to go to the Post

271
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,159
Office anymore

272
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,278
so we made a bunch of seeds and had

273
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:53,578
Gypsy and others distribute them and uh

274
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,500
and it allowed me you know to not have

275
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:59,099
to worry about that

276
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,720
ah okay so so let's go let's rewind a

277
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,879
little bit then so what was your

278
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,259
introduction to the online community

279
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,120
because as you just mentioned you know

280
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,360
you were giving out seeds to people how

281
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,740
did you discover the forums and and uh

282
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,940
come to be a part of the online

283
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,159
community

284
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,140
oh gosh I don't know but it was you know

285
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,539
cannabis world and overgrow

286
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:21,360
I guess maybe a friend showed it to me

287
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,338
or something back I don't know 99 or

288
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,820
whenever it was you know

289
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:29,940
2000 or whenever those those things were

290
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,220
yeah so okay and prior to that we mostly

291
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,200
just you know mingling with the locals

292
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,180
and sort of just doing your own thing

293
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,079
I don't think I had a computer or

294
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,879
something prior to that

295
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:44,879
there you go truly a mountain man I love

296
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,620
that I love that so um let's go let's go

297
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,539
back a little bit before that then what

298
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,278
was it like living in the area where

299
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:52,199
before the online communities you know

300
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,360
because this is largely regarded by a

301
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,060
lot of people as like probably the

302
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,399
Golden Era of NorCal cannabis production

303
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:02,278
is that how you would describe it

304
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,480
oh yeah I would for sure

305
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:09,120
um it was such a a really

306
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,639
great and different group of people that

307
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,000
settled this area you know back in that

308
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,799
original rush you know late 70s or

309
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,220
something started probably you know

310
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:23,819
early 80s uh you know there was every

311
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,560
half Smuggler and you know hippie and

312
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,720
and weed dealer from down the city

313
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,778
started buying property up here and and

314
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,459
came up and and uh there's people up

315
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,039
here from you know all over the United

316
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,599
States and it was a really interesting

317
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,278
Community

318
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,560
um you know A lot's changed from since

319
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:43,559
back then for sure there's a lot of

320
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,899
newer people up here the new guard we

321
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,539
call them uh

322
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,360
and uh The Vibes probably not what it

323
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:54,480
used to be but I still love it up here

324
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,940
um I've been here for 37 years I think

325
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,200
this is my 37th year and I'm not going

326
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,440
in anywhere

327
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,420
uh incredible incredible and I guess a

328
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,399
lot of people currently are discussing

329
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,958
the way farmers are being pushed out of

330
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,578
the industry with the ever increasing

331
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,559
legalization and the like you know the

332
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,958
more corporate Farms coming into the

333
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,578
space is this something you're concerned

334
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,018
about or do you think like it sort of

335
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:22,138
doesn't affect you

336
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:24,539
well it doesn't doesn't concern me too

337
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,639
much and and yeah it doesn't doesn't

338
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,278
affect me really you know I'm gonna do

339
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,440
what I've always done and hey you know

340
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,539
we you know our there's there's not

341
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,880
really good folk going to jail for a

342
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:40,019
long time like like it was back in the

343
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:42,958
old days and uh and that's a win

344
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,659
and uh nothing else you know this other

345
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,159
stuff there was no money in it back in

346
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,899
the beginning you know

347
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,240
uh

348
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,458
and you know there's not much money in

349
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,039
it now

350
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:58,379
it's kind of like we've come full circle

351
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:01,860
yeah there you go that's a that's a good

352
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:05,159
analogy I like that no you know there's

353
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,940
lots of people who who kind of rode this

354
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:12,299
gold rush in and um and there was a lot

355
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,600
of undesirable you know entities out

356
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,939
there uh that came with that and I'm

357
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,500
kind of glad to see him go to be gone to

358
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,720
be honest you know a lot of these big

359
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,200
farms are closing up shops you know they

360
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,700
can't even make it work

361
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,500
yeah true true I've heard a lot of them

362
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,240
yeah just putting out a lot of volume

363
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,399
but not a lot of quality

364
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,620
yeah and they just you know they can't

365
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,078
they can't deliver to their to their

366
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,179
lenders you know what what they promised

367
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:43,078
back when you know back when it was

368
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:46,739
worth more a couple years ago

369
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,179
yeah certainly I mean I guess I guess an

370
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,159
interesting sort of direction to take

371
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,439
this in is that a lot of people would

372
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,838
look at many of your offerings over the

373
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,060
years and sort of think to himself these

374
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,540
aren't necessarily the most commercially

375
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:02,939
orientated plants have you found that

376
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,500
you are able to grow your strains and

377
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,620
offerings in a way that they aren't

378
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,179
viable or are they more of like a unique

379
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,519
tool that's not necessarily for

380
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,578
production in your mind

381
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,879
sure you know you could uh you could

382
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:21,659
probably grow deep Chunk in a in a you

383
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:25,139
know light a single 1000 watt light over

384
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:28,019
an air over an area like 12 feet by 12

385
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,519
feet or something and you probably get a

386
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,100
couple of pounds that out of that light

387
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,379
with that set up and it'll produce out

388
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,540
on the edges because it's a low light

389
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,039
plant you know we used to grow it under

390
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,778
the trees

391
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,299
um let's see with Haze you could find a

392
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:45,720
killer clone and and you know sell out

393
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:48,419
just for 400 or something both of those

394
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,940
can be commercially viable

395
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:52,319
yeah wow that's two sort of totally

396
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,180
different ends of the spectrum but

397
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,560
you're making it work I really like that

398
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,599
and I'd love to hear a bit more about

399
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,759
the Deep chunk because I think I read a

400
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,560
post where you you said a similar

401
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,019
sentiment about you know lower light

402
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,778
levels I guess sort of the implication

403
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,940
is that you could maybe run like you

404
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:10,439
know twice as big of a space with half

405
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,540
the lighting so you know the same sort

406
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,980
of power bill but get twice as much

407
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:16,439
yield sort of thing is that sort of what

408
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,360
you're getting at yes exactly you know

409
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,639
if you can if you can fudge with the

410
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,060
inputs then then you can definitely make

411
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,940
it work remember this is an old plant

412
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:28,439
and uh up here in the old days we were

413
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,699
growing under the trees you know we had

414
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,740
helicopters all up on us and uh so for a

415
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,679
plant to do well underneath a Manzanita

416
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,620
or a madrone or you know under a [Â __Â ]

417
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,859
tree uh it has to be able to boogie down

418
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,320
in some lower light levels

419
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,659
yeah of course and look I uh in the past

420
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,278
I've grown deep chunk inside a tent and

421
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,198
I actually found it quite challenging

422
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,720
and I think this may well be the reason

423
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,179
I was probably suffocating it with light

424
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,459
yeah yeah it's a low light plant for

425
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,399
sure like you know and it works really

426
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:05,220
well like we try to grow all that Dutch

427
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,140
stuff under the trees up here and that

428
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,240
[Â __Â ] comes out so wispy that you're just

429
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,980
not even going to sell it you know

430
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,220
you're going to be working at 7-Eleven

431
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,140
or something but uh that deep chunk is

432
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,019
going to throw their monkey balls in the

433
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,459
shade no matter what

434
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:22,199
yeah okay that's interesting that's

435
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,519
interesting and when you just referenced

436
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,079
Hayes and you said you know you could

437
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,298
find a really nice Fina you could do

438
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,759
really well with that I was interested

439
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:31,798
to ask you do you find that you're able

440
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,200
to get enough yield off the haze that it

441
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,480
like makes up for the the spindly sort

442
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,819
of structure or the quality is enough

443
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,460
that it it equals out that way

444
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,379
oh I I mean I've never

445
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,538
I've never run them commercially by

446
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,320
clone you know I was growing from seed

447
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:50,700
and um you know the seed plant in a

448
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,319
greenhouse or something it'll do a

449
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,538
couple of pounds you know it'll give you

450
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,659
a kilo or something

451
00:17:54,538 --> 00:18:00,240
um if the smoke is right then you know a

452
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,460
kilo of haze is extremely precious so

453
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,359
yeah it yields enough

454
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,220
um

455
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,199
because it's just it's so much better

456
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,298
than everything else it's really it's

457
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,019
Priceless you know

458
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:16,500
yeah sure okay and out of curiosity have

459
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:18,480
you ever been tempted to uh pass out a a

460
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,058
clone or a Seedling or you just you

461
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,460
don't really take cuttings at all of it

462
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm probably gonna run a Hayes run

463
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,860
pretty soon you got me thinking about it

464
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,779
that's funny funny but um yeah I would

465
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:32,639
love to have a haze clone you know

466
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,339
[Â __Â ] you you find a good Haze clone

467
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,960
buddy you can change the world

468
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:39,058
yeah I think that would be a really

469
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,558
really unique sort of offering to bring

470
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:42,178
to the table because although there's

471
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,038
like a lot of focal discussion around

472
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,559
Hayes I don't think I've heard anyone

473
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,240
sort of float the idea of doing that in

474
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,538
the sense that you might

475
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,419
yeah that's that's like it's a real real

476
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,279
high up on my project list I can't wait

477
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,440
you know I've been growing all this

478
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,918
stuff for the market for for so many

479
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,740
years and and uh now's the perfect time

480
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,320
you know because the the prices are down

481
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,819
and everything else it's you can take a

482
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,798
vacation from what you're doing you're

483
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:12,500
not getting paid anyway right

484
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,058
so

485
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,679
that's like the perfect no it's like the

486
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:18,119
perfect time to do something exactly

487
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,919
like that

488
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,959
there you go that would be interesting

489
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,780
and out of curiosity you know a minute

490
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,058
or two ago you mentioned gelato 33. do

491
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,038
you think a gelato 33 Hayes hybrid would

492
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,918
be interesting or it's a bit too muddled

493
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:36,298
yeah I know every time I find a cerebral

494
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,640
uh you know fast flowering hybrid I I

495
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:40,079
think about Haze you know yeah this one

496
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
might squash the high it might not

497
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,538
squash the high you know

498
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,599
okay I get you I get you

499
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:51,119
um I'm always on the hunt for that and I

500
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,939
do think that the OG would probably be

501
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,178
an interesting one because oh gee is is

502
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,460
a plant that uh well it's proven itself

503
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,940
to breed true for for this high resin

504
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,798
content and quality resin and uh that's

505
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,320
that's a pretty rare thing those are

506
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,519
those are some pretty important boxes to

507
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,399
be checking on

508
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,599
uh and it certainly does that as a

509
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,200
parent

510
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:18,659
so and I think with Haze you have this

511
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,519
like sort of uh notable five percent

512
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,720
rule would you be able to run over that

513
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,619
one for the listeners who aren't

514
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,319
familiar

515
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:28,918
yeah all right I mean about one in 20 is

516
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:30,960
is going to be really exceptional

517
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,059
um you know you'll get it you'll get a

518
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,700
few there okay I bet you'll get this

519
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:37,798
giant percentage of them uh more than 50

520
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,880
then you'll be that you'll you know at

521
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,179
least

522
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,580
I would say oh man this is hey this is

523
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,140
horrible you know so it's a real pain in

524
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,139
the ass to grow you have to Rifle

525
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,160
through all these undesirable plants and

526
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,799
uh

527
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,220
but you know if you find a good one it's

528
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:59,639
it makes it all worth it that's for sure

529
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,279
yeah okay beautiful and to you the ones

530
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,919
that are truly the keeper ones what sort

531
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,019
of traits do they embody in terms of a

532
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,000
lot of people talk about hazes is like

533
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,160
this female is maybe Colombian leaning

534
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,720
this one's more Thai leaning how would

535
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,220
you describe the ones that you feel are

536
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,700
the ultimate keepers

537
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,860
I I like the Thai side of the family

538
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,600
um it's kind of a citrusy probably

539
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:24,779
limonene or something

540
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:27,959
uh thing going on kind of a sour apple

541
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:31,200
it reminds me of like back in the early

542
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,480
80s stuff like the some of the last Thai

543
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,298
shipments that were coming in we called

544
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,279
it chocolate Thai here in California

545
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:40,200
um it was really really good stuff but

546
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:43,019
if you grew that stuff out you would get

547
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,080
this this very similar thing to the haze

548
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:48,960
that I grow and it's and it's and it's

549
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,779
kind of a makeup

550
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,519
yeah nice and I mean as someone who

551
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,500
unfortunately has never been able to try

552
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,720
any like Thai stick or anything like

553
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,880
that were there any other Thai varieties

554
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,538
that left like a lasting impression on

555
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,340
you

556
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:08,700
oh yeah the the early the earlier Thai

557
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:11,879
stick that probably was the foundation

558
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,759
of Hawaiian weed back then

559
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,159
um it was a real spicy thing and you

560
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,720
know and it would blow up in your lungs

561
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,720
you couldn't hold that stuff in they

562
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,360
called it expando bug right this was

563
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,659
most certainly uh Thai hybrids that were

564
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:31,259
grown in in Hawaii some of that stuff in

565
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:33,960
the early 80s was was just insanely uh

566
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:36,440
potent and and uh just rip your head

567
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,440
clean off

568
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,140
yeah wow interesting that's that's

569
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,020
really interesting I think I'd only ever

570
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,659
tried like a Hawaiian lime once and it

571
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:47,460
kind of weirdly reminded me of Sour

572
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,880
Diesel have you ever had that sort of

573
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,880
experience

574
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,259
um no well I mean I wouldn't imagine I

575
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,080
wouldn't be surprised if it was Sour

576
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,119
Diesel these days uh but Hawaii got hit

577
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,699
hard uh you know I'm I'm sitting here

578
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:06,239
whining about camp and all that in

579
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,519
NorCal uh well I got it much much worse

580
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,500
you know with this operation green sweep

581
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,179
whatever they whatever they called it

582
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,759
they would they have guys hanging from

583
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,159
helicopters off a ropes and like you

584
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,740
know combing the combing the the forest

585
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,320
like you know just a few feet from the

586
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,079
ground it was really hard to grow for a

587
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,918
long time in Hawaii uh from you know

588
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:31,980
Reagan from Reagan on for a long time

589
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,020
and um and a lot of the old stuff just

590
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,120
got wiped out

591
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,400
yeah okay interesting have you ever

592
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,379
tried to grow any Hawaiian or it was

593
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,900
always sort of like just adjacent to

594
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:46,140
what you're interested in no there's a

595
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,320
neighbor here that um that used to grow

596
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,240
some Hawaiian he might even still but it

597
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,460
just but it wasn't very good you know it

598
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,700
wasn't like the stuff I remember

599
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,640
yeah sure I don't suppose you ever had

600
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,159
the mythical Maui Wowie or

601
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,038
no none of the stuff that we got from

602
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,059
Hawaii had names uh

603
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,519
um

604
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:12,960
it was you know brown or green baby

605
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,960
those take your pick that

606
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,000
that's what it was and and you know and

607
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:22,200
we knew back then the brown was [Â __Â ]

608
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,659
good you know it was and and there was

609
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,360
another tie trait I reckon

610
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,520
yeah that does sound very tiresque

611
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,899
doesn't it like the the more Brown quote

612
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,279
it goes like the better it gets you

613
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,740
don't hear people saying that about many

614
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,019
varieties except for Thai

615
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,480
right uh

616
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,038
there's you know I mean they're some of

617
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,279
my favorite modern varieties will go

618
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:46,379
Brown too uh you know camphor doesn't

619
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,899
hold on to its color for very long you

620
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,640
got to move that [Â __Â ] quick you know for

621
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,320
four months after you take that stuff

622
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,340
down it's going brown no matter what you

623
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,980
do

624
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:58,079
ah look you just said one of the the

625
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,360
favorite varieties of the show the chem

626
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,980
dog what what's your experience with the

627
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,199
chem dog have you grown many of the

628
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,620
different cuts or just the four I've

629
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,019
gone the 91 the D and the four

630
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:11,339
yeah and any one of them sort of more of

631
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:12,779
a favorite than the others or they're

632
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,220
all just sort of good in their own way

633
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,839
yeah I like that camphor the best

634
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,839
[Music]

635
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,839
um

636
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,778
I wasn't a very big fan of the 91 and

637
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,809
the way that it grew you know uh

638
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:29,940
it just doesn't do a lot

639
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:33,778
[Laughter]

640
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:36,058
yeah the D is pretty good and it's a

641
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:39,058
little earlier outdoors and it makes a

642
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:41,038
nice bud and and does all that stuff

643
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:43,619
um but I think the four All Things

644
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,019
Considered how it grows and and and how

645
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:47,839
it hit your head I think the four was

646
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:50,339
probably the best my favorite anyway

647
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,740
that's all I care about

648
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,599
yeah look I can understand where you're

649
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,579
coming from especially being outdoors

650
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,399
you know I think the 91 does need a lot

651
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,558
of uh you know babying a lot of coddling

652
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,659
as we might say so that sort of all

653
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,339
checks out one of the focal discussion

654
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,500
points on the show we talk about with

655
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,119
guests is what do we think the lineage

656
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,859
is because we still don't really know

657
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,538
what chem is a lot of people say you

658
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:16,699
know Northern Lights something like that

659
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,700
do you have any sort of guesses no way

660
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:23,399
nowhere laughs

661
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:26,220
I don't know either it's it's you know

662
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,320
uh it's really good though it's you know

663
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,960
a combination of what came before it is

664
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,119
what it is it's probably some you know

665
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,038
awesome

666
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:38,038
transgressive segregation up to a bag

667
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,019
seed from some dude's closet back in 82

668
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,960
or whatever

669
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:45,900
yeah yeah it could be and look I love

670
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,000
that term transgressive segregation me

671
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,860
and you have spoken about it a bit in

672
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,359
our personal chats but I have a feeling

673
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:54,359
some of the listeners may not be

674
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,619
familiar can you give your sort of basic

675
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,719
um you know description of what

676
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,459
transgressive segregation is for the

677
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,620
viewers well

678
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,220
um there's you know there's hybrid

679
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:08,099
bigger or you know heterosis and the F1

680
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,640
where you kind of have weaker traits of

681
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:13,199
one parent being masked by the input of

682
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,320
another

683
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,440
um and and so you know everybody

684
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:21,000
likes f1s because they kind of you know

685
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,038
they're they're not weak plants they're

686
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,599
nice and uniform it's good but it's kind

687
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,700
of mid-parent values mostly it's

688
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,119
predictable you know that's why seed

689
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,360
companies used to do it and such but uh

690
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:36,719
it doesn't really fly off the charts in

691
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,339
any in any in any category uh that

692
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,900
doesn't happen until you get into the

693
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:43,259
act too

694
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:48,179
um and um that's when you get very

695
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:50,038
extreme uh phenotypes uh that that you

696
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,500
haven't seen before in either parental

697
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:54,000
line and boy that's where the fun begins

698
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,538
too whether you're just you know

699
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,119
selecting clones or or

700
00:27:56,538 --> 00:28:02,220
selecting reading prospects yeah

701
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,139
brilliant stuff there okay because this

702
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,120
is sort of a topic we talk about on the

703
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,220
show but have maybe never actually

704
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,199
correctly labeled it as transgressive

705
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,460
segregation but just so I'm trying to

706
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,679
get in the mindset of The Listener

707
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,538
you're sort of saying like it's when you

708
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,038
get a result that you wouldn't be able

709
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:18,839
to predict from either parents it's like

710
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:19,740
something totally left of field so to

711
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,038
speak

712
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,019
correct it's a it's a it's a it's a

713
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,019
measurements that this this thing is

714
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:31,019
doing in one in some category

715
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:34,319
um where it's it's measurements lie

716
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:37,619
outside the range of either parent

717
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:40,139
so so you know so we're we we're talking

718
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:42,719
about uh you know faster than a speeding

719
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,259
bullet right you know frostier than the

720
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,960
DC and more cerebral than Haze okay that

721
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,640
that's that's a possibility and that

722
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,058
would be an example of transgressive

723
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,799
segregation and and um and it's not it's

724
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:57,599
not something that doesn't happen often

725
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:59,460
you know it's actually it's it's more of

726
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,918
the rule than the exception

727
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,798
yeah okay that's that's a great answer

728
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,200
there because I was gonna ask some of

729
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,819
the most exciting results of a cross in

730
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,919
my opinion are exactly that you know

731
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:12,899
when you get something very sort of

732
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,419
unexpected and so

733
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,120
when you use more land race or pure

734
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:21,480
breeding strains I think you tend to see

735
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:23,819
this occur more but my question is do

736
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,399
you feel that transgressive segregation

737
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:28,139
can still occur with two poly hybrids

738
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,699
like it's just harder to come across or

739
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,538
do you really need that pure breeding

740
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:36,240
strain to do it no no it can happen with

741
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:40,440
any introducing any new you know new

742
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,740
germ plasm uh but the more Divergent the

743
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,798
the original parental lines are the

744
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,019
higher the incidence of transgressive

745
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,058
segregation that you'll see in the in

746
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:53,278
the following populations

747
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:56,759
that's brilliant okay so if someone's

748
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,980
looking to like get them put their name

749
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,140
on the map to establish you know some

750
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,700
reputation for themselves do you think

751
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,899
this is a good route to travel like do

752
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,419
you think this might be sort of good

753
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:09,599
advice for an aspiring breeder in terms

754
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,640
of how you can make something unique

755
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,099
well yeah sure I mean that's that's

756
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,159
that's where that's where you know new

757
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:19,319
starts uh

758
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,880
um and then you and then you would take

759
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,359
you know you would you would pick

760
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,919
several you know let's say candidates or

761
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,439
you know

762
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,080
from the F2 Generation set them aside

763
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,880
and and then and then breed them and and

764
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,158
then and then you'd rank their progeny

765
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,960
and say okay this one was worth breeding

766
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,000
with and this one wasn't and and that's

767
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,740
just the way it goes but this is this is

768
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,659
pretty standard stuff I mean this is how

769
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,460
you know cornbread is done or anything

770
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:48,179
else I mean that's what breeders do is

771
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:51,259
is they you know try to slam two things

772
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:54,240
together get into the you know the the

773
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:56,700
later generations and find something you

774
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,798
know exceptional and try to try to make

775
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,798
families out of these out of these like

776
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,599
you know individuals and and some of the

777
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,940
families will will succeed and some of

778
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,158
them will fail and it's just you're just

779
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,558
crunchy numbers really

780
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,960
okay that's so interesting yeah there's

781
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,700
definitely a lot of things the Cannabis

782
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,919
Community can learn from like modern

783
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,740
agriculture that we're sort of only just

784
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,620
picking up so let's use the monkey Haze

785
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,140
as a sort of reference how would you go

786
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:27,058
about finding that unique phenotype

787
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,740
you've got your F1 seeds where do you go

788
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:31,678
from there do you just pop those and try

789
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,620
to find that pheno I've just used it no

790
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,320
no F1 sheets I would I would breed them

791
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:40,139
into them into themselves and come to

792
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,700
the app too before I before I even start

793
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,820
looking for anything

794
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,159
strangely new and excellent

795
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,898
ah fantastic okay so if someone wanted

796
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,000
to really try to do this they really

797
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:54,839
need to be in the F2 or Beyond

798
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,480
correct beautiful beautiful so the goal

799
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,859
of uh this F2 generation is as you I

800
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,659
think you mentioned earlier something

801
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,119
more resonance than the Deep chunk but

802
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:05,580
with that Haze effect is that correct

803
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,778
yeah I mean it doesn't it could be asked

804
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:10,019
to we're just talking about

805
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:12,419
recombination Generations after the F1

806
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:13,918
anything after you you could be a b if

807
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:17,159
you could be a first generation back

808
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,899
cross just the next step after app one

809
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,720
is when you're going to get some

810
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:24,418
recombination uh happening within the

811
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,000
genes and and and when you reshuffle the

812
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:29,278
deck like that uh that's when that's

813
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,619
when [Â __Â ] gets interesting

814
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,720
uh beautiful and and out of like a

815
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,959
personal curiosity when you've done this

816
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,538
in the past Fina typically do the plants

817
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,740
look like they might look like one

818
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:42,240
parent they might look like the other

819
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,038
you just got to hunt them through or is

820
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,538
that sort of keep afino looking like a

821
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,720
50 50

822
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:51,480
. oh the F1 will be 50 50 but the app

823
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,480
too it's all over the board you know you

824
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,860
have a you know massive variation

825
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,839
but that's that's what you're looking

826
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:59,119
for you know a seed buyer would probably

827
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,158
hate it

828
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,898
if you bought a pack of seeds and it was

829
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,760
all across the park but but if you're

830
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,019
but if you're going on the hunt I mean

831
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,538
that's what you're that's what you're

832
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,879
looking for aren't you you know show me

833
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:15,179
as many different cards as possible

834
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,740
yeah so so with the monkey Haze I think

835
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,960
there's like a really notable photo

836
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,240
online of this beautiful looking plant

837
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,819
and if I had to guess I would say that

838
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,740
it sort of looks like a slightly more

839
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:27,658
Haze leaning plant but it's obviously

840
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,759
got that resin from the deep chunk that

841
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,620
we talked about has that been your

842
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,359
experience in the past that they because

843
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:34,859
you're looking for that Haze effect you

844
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,778
sort of are looking for a haze type

845
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:39,359
plant or not necessarily you could get

846
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:41,159
like a full deep chunk squat Indica

847
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,558
looking plant that had that Haze effect

848
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:46,380
because it's just the one

849
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,058
yeah I don't know I've struck out until

850
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,340
now I haven't gone through a bunch of

851
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:54,240
them but it's a hard thing you know

852
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:57,178
because Hayes by itself is really really

853
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,058
excellent you know and um

854
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:03,720
you know let's say let's say d chunks

855
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:05,940
threw a bunch of extra resin on it uh to

856
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,319
the naked eye or whatever but then you

857
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,559
know when you when you start examining

858
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,358
the Hat resin head size and stuff it

859
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,000
just doesn't measure up to what Hazel's

860
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:17,239
doing by itself already uh deep chunk

861
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,119
can have incredibly big resin heads too

862
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:23,039
but uh you know getting getting to find

863
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,379
those plants

864
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,480
um is always tough you know because

865
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:28,980
because it could look more Frosty you're

866
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,780
like you know you were telling me the

867
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,820
other day you know before about some

868
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,099
plant that oh man it's just a resin bomb

869
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,019
and stuff but you know I want to look

870
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,379
close is it a bunch of is it a bunch of

871
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:42,059
Stipe cells you know is there big head

872
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,460
size there I want to see that big head

873
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:46,799
size you know with anything that I'm

874
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,898
doing I think you know that that's uh

875
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,720
that those are the storage containers of

876
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:53,878
what what I'm looking for and um the

877
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,459
bigger the vessel the better

878
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,139
yeah beautiful answer there and I agree

879
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,179
just for anyone listening we were

880
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,279
talking about the mac and I think you

881
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:04,139
actually without knowing much about it

882
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,540
hit it perfectly on the head a lot of

883
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:09,118
people say that there's a lot of like uh

884
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:11,579
resin stalks but not necessarily the

885
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,280
heads and so you know what's is that

886
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:16,320
really useful not really yeah no there's

887
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,079
notorious but a train wreck was like

888
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,599
that Northern Lights was like that you

889
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,119
know there's a big long list of plants

890
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,740
and modern and modern plants too you

891
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,079
know modern clothes that are you know

892
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:29,939
all hyped up and stuff and then you get

893
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,339
them and look at them and and say you

894
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,338
know it's it's a it's an empty vessel

895
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:42,240
really small heads and and you know just

896
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:44,780
a bunch of a forest of of stalks and um

897
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:48,539
and and they don't get too high you know

898
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:52,440
uh in my experience that that the big

899
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:55,199
head you know uh individuals do

900
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,780
yeah totally obviously a lot of people

901
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,578
listening very keen to hear about some

902
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,200
of the old school days some of the

903
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,359
history but before we get there you just

904
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,519
reference you know the hype strains I

905
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,900
want to quickly touch on that first I

906
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,900
think a lot of people listening to this

907
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,940
would uh be Keen to hear what you like

908
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,039
out of the more modern genetics so I'm

909
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,500
wondering how to say the past 20 years

910
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:19,858
since like OG Kush what has impressed

911
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:25,559
you what do you think is good weed

912
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:26,940
um the cams and the ogs and and uh

913
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,699
gosh

914
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,858
that's put me on a [Â __Â ] uh

915
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:34,199
there's there's a bunch of them the haze

916
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:36,659
the haze you know all the hay stuff out

917
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,939
of you know that that people are hunting

918
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,460
down those you know those uh that East

919
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,280
Coast Haze and stuff that's that stuff's

920
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,440
uh pretty good A lot of these uh

921
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,420
Northern Light Haze type things that are

922
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,880
around

923
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,559
um gosh you know there's there if I was

924
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,019
growing outdoor I'd be saying something

925
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,420
like Salmon Creek or something there's

926
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:59,699
some big there's some plants here oh and

927
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,240
and even Blue Dream

928
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:05,460
um but you know I think everybody's just

929
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,000
kind of growing for this market and not

930
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,740
growing for themselves and and you know

931
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,980
you try to be honest about what you

932
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:16,858
really like and and and and you should

933
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,960
stick to that because uh

934
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:21,719
the market is Ever Changing you know

935
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,579
people get burnt out on on on really

936
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,739
good plants a really good plant comes

937
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,119
along everybody grows it the market gets

938
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:29,098
burnt out demand something else

939
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,380
everybody stops growing this really

940
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,000
[Â __Â ] good plant you know that it's

941
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,619
like hey dude what are you doing what

942
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,900
you know don't [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] can this

943
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,000
thing this is a [Â __Â ] fabulous plan

944
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,380
but you know their buyers don't want it

945
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,659
don't want it anymore they've had too

946
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,519
much sub down their throat and they move

947
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:48,259
on and nobody keeps it and really good

948
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,259
plants get lost like that

949
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,400
yeah definitely look how about I narrow

950
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,619
it down for you because I know that you

951
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,420
are a very talented outdoor grower so

952
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,760
let's talk outdoor varieties for a

953
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:03,200
little bit what are some of the MVPs for

954
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,200
you what do you like to grow outdoors

955
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,820
um Blue Dream actually Salmon Creek bed

956
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,740
big bird train wreck was a good one

957
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,480
outside

958
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:14,819
uh just any plant that will that can get

959
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,338
really big we we were messing around you

960
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,200
know we used to be able to grow 25 or

961
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:23,159
something in Mendocino County here and

962
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:24,779
and so you know everybody finally poked

963
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,838
their head out from underneath the trees

964
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,000
and started you know doing these big uh

965
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,219
you know big plant grows

966
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,139
uh you wound upon to be as big as

967
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:36,959
possible like you know I've made the

968
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:39,420
mistake of growing my you know like sour

969
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,059
diesel and stuff and you know in the

970
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,680
same same outdoor thing and that that

971
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:46,799
stuff doesn't go very well at all

972
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,239
Outdoors um uh blue dream was [Â __Â ]

973
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,359
good

974
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,519
and um I even liked blue dream as a

975
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,199
smoke and my friend over up at CSI he

976
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,599
laughs and laughs and laughs at me about

977
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,819
it you know but but that's my honest

978
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,160
opinion this year that plant was a

979
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:05,220
pretty good smoke and it was [Â __Â ]

980
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,980
absolutely bulletproof and and a host of

981
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:10,319
other categories you know and that and

982
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,179
that that that matters that matters a

983
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,180
lot you know when you're evaluating

984
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:17,578
plants and and what what doesn't [Â __Â ]

985
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:19,858
matter at least to me is you know

986
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,140
whether or not the [Â __Â ] Market wants

987
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,659
it or not you know I'm not gonna not

988
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:27,659
gonna you know

989
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:30,598
you know grow grow for that anymore or

990
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,699
if I see I'm full of [Â __Â ] I have been

991
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,410
doing exactly that but shame on me for

992
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:36,659
doing it

993
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:38,578
[Laughter]

994
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:40,679
uh don't worry I think we can all relate

995
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:43,740
to that in a sense you did reference the

996
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,419
Salmon Creek uh big bud which is a very

997
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:47,699
interesting strain because it's hard to

998
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,980
get information on it I guess I would be

999
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,659
interested to hear what was your opinion

1000
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,240
on the high because a lot of people like

1001
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,799
to Barn humbug big bud and say he's just

1002
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,598
a cash crop Australian it wasn't good

1003
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,400
but there are a lot of people who say

1004
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,760
the Salmon Creek one was actually really

1005
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,820
special what's your thoughts on it

1006
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,460
I'd probably say it was like a high B

1007
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:10,740
and uh go with the former opinion it was

1008
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,659
just a cash crop thing but it was it was

1009
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,179
you know it was acceptable and stuff but

1010
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:17,159
yeah it just grew really really well and

1011
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,779
it was just absolutely bulletproof and

1012
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,759
it could come out really well a lot

1013
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,619
better like if you you know indoors and

1014
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,200
stuff I've seen it look really really

1015
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,700
good but yeah it wasn't all that maybe a

1016
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,858
high B

1017
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,179
certainly not great certainly not grade

1018
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:32,759
a weed no

1019
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:35,338
very interesting okay and I mean out of

1020
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,140
curiosity you you said that Sour Diesel

1021
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:38,940
doesn't grow particularly well Outdoors

1022
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:41,279
which you know that's that's definitely

1023
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,960
something we hear around were you a fan

1024
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,700
of indoor Sour Diesel because there was

1025
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,300
certainly a time where it sort of took

1026
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:50,419
everyone you know by storm

1027
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,420
um

1028
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:57,480
weren't the chems around by then

1029
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:00,359
yeah they were around before yeah yeah

1030
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,599
you know I like sour diesel you know

1031
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,699
it's it's a good high but it's like it's

1032
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,579
like a 30 minute High man

1033
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:10,379
you know after 30 minutes you're just

1034
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:12,300
like you got to smoke more

1035
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,700
they're probably great for the guys out

1036
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,400
on the Block Sling It slinging 20 bags

1037
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:20,219
or whatever but uh you know I mean if it

1038
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,720
it wasn't something that I would that I

1039
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:25,500
would want to keep around because of the

1040
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:29,578
the duration of the high however that

1041
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,559
[Â __Â ] plant uh processes better into

1042
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,500
concentrates uh than any other plant

1043
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,880
I've seen in in decades decades yeah

1044
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,460
that's interesting are you a big

1045
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,980
concentrate guy or more into flower

1046
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,780
I'm more into flower but and you know I

1047
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,579
mean if you got a toothache or something

1048
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,760
you're going to grab reach for something

1049
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:51,119
stronger you know I'll do that if I'm in

1050
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,440
you know massive pain I'll you know I'll

1051
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,019
turn to hash

1052
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,519
yeah nice okay so with the the sour

1053
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:58,440
diesel and you just reference you know

1054
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,659
its ability to make really good

1055
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,179
concentrates are you are you a bubble

1056
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:04,920
guy do you like BHO or sauce or like

1057
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:07,259
whatever what's your thing

1058
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,800
I don't have a preference really

1059
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,960
um but that plant Sour Diesel it's like

1060
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,000
the first one that I've seen go through

1061
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,579
all of those things you just listed and

1062
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,219
and still be able to you know to be able

1063
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:22,320
to be identified you know so so many

1064
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:25,439
plants uh you run you run it through

1065
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,440
water extraction and and um it'll just

1066
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,119
it tastes like generic hash after you

1067
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,880
know it smells like generic cash all

1068
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,820
this other stuff I've seen uh Sour

1069
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,940
Diesel that was you know BHO propane and

1070
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,820
and uh and smoke like sour diesel it you

1071
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:45,240
know it's Essence just comes through

1072
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:48,720
with flying colors uh so you know for

1073
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:52,139
all of its faults as a grower as a you

1074
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:55,078
know as a plant for growing uh it makes

1075
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,759
up for it in that for sure and it's a

1076
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,280
good smoke it's a good smoke just a

1077
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,560
flower doesn't last long of a high but

1078
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,300
otherwise you know it's a good plant but

1079
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:05,639
the low you know bottom half of it's

1080
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,160
going to be empty usually you know it

1081
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,659
just got such as internodal lengths and

1082
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,879
all these other things that go against

1083
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:14,519
it you know when you're trying to grow

1084
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,700
It Outdoors that it wasn't a it wasn't a

1085
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:20,460
contender for the big pots no way

1086
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,500
yeah I like that classification system

1087
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,059
not a contender for a big pot that's a

1088
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,619
good way to put it

1089
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,880
um out of curiosity on the other end of

1090
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,619
the spectrum you know you were saying it

1091
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,358
doesn't last very long what are some

1092
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,760
strains to you that you feel really have

1093
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,460
the legs and go the mile

1094
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,839
oh this one I just smoked I wish I knew

1095
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,400
what it was I'm gonna get with my

1096
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,639
neighbor and ask him what the hell it is

1097
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,760
but yeah uh

1098
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:46,739
um hazel put you down for like four

1099
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,060
hours

1100
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:51,358
um

1101
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:54,119
a really really long High

1102
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,799
oh gee you know OG will knock you out

1103
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,660
for a couple hours

1104
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,480
now there's a bunch of them

1105
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:01,618
uh I think I think the cams too are real

1106
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,039
good

1107
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:07,280
but most most

1108
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:10,199
varieties that I've tried uh recently

1109
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,680
nothing stands out like you know the old

1110
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:15,598
tie or anything uh or you know or Haze

1111
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,818
that gonna you know you're going into

1112
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,500
four or five hours

1113
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:22,139
um

1114
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:24,960
not as modern stuff does

1115
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:27,960
um but I've tried recently

1116
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,699
yeah certainly certainly and with the

1117
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,559
haze let's go back to that what like

1118
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:33,659
what was your introduction how did you

1119
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,119
get the haze seeds and what sort of

1120
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:38,098
stimulated you to do it did you hear

1121
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,680
magical things about Haze and we're like

1122
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:43,500
hey I gotta check that out myself yeah

1123
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:46,759
well uh that's a funny that's a funny

1124
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:51,358
story you know um

1125
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:53,099
and I think it was 93 or something I I

1126
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,920
got camped on up here you know

1127
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:57,960
helicopters came and took all my [Â __Â ]

1128
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,940
so you know there was they could see it

1129
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,519
through the Manzanita it was packed full

1130
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,139
under there you know probably changed

1131
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:06,300
the color of the green or that Manzanita

1132
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:09,358
for those helicopters

1133
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:12,180
um and stick out like a short thumb but

1134
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,578
um So the plan was to go deeper in the

1135
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:16,618
shade right so I wouldn't get camped on

1136
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:19,500
and I I was taken in by those damn

1137
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,760
brochures from from all seed bank back

1138
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,400
then you know

1139
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,680
about how Durbin poison will produce

1140
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,300
good chunky buds even during the worst

1141
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,679
season and all this other stuff and I'm

1142
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,660
thinking Amsterdam in fact that's a

1143
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:33,419
place that's a [Â __Â ] foggy cloudy mess

1144
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:36,239
isn't it do they even get anything did

1145
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,940
you even get any sun over there and like

1146
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,618
if it if it produces good there maybe I

1147
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,539
could take that [Â __Â ] under some deeper

1148
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:45,838
cover and still be able to produce it so

1149
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:48,539
you know a way I went on my seed on my

1150
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,219
seed you know journey to go get all this

1151
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:52,318
awesome variety that I was reading about

1152
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:56,159
in this brochure and these brochures and

1153
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:58,079
such and I got there and uh you know and

1154
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,699
I would go out and I would go get

1155
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,318
samples from all the different coffee

1156
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:04,139
shops and have them all label and stuff

1157
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:05,940
and try them out and then if if I liked

1158
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,039
one I would find out where they had

1159
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,139
these seeds for this thing in town and

1160
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:13,559
you know or go about it like that

1161
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:15,358
well the hey they were selling so there

1162
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,838
were some really good Haze this would

1163
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,400
have been the winter of 94.95 uh you

1164
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,440
know I was there over Christmas and all

1165
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,660
that and New Year's

1166
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,818
um there were some really good haze from

1167
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:29,279
from one of the older coffee shops at

1168
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:31,619
the time I forgot who had it but but it

1169
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,480
was and it was kind of brown but that

1170
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:36,059
stuff was really really good and really

1171
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,460
trippy and I already had Hayes seed on

1172
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:42,179
my list I needed to find those

1173
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:44,039
um but even though even though after I

1174
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:45,960
got it man I kept going to buy more of

1175
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,858
that age for the rest of my trip it kind

1176
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,480
of [Â __Â ] up my my testing you know

1177
00:46:48,858 --> 00:46:53,279
I'm supposed to be supposed to be

1178
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,079
testing all these varieties been inside

1179
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,540
[Â __Â ] Hazel is all I wanted to smoke

1180
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,339
and you know and I finally found it you

1181
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:01,679
know they had it all over town in

1182
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:03,719
various hybrid forms and stuff and I

1183
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,779
bought a few of those too but I could

1184
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:09,919
only find it at positronics and uh that

1185
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:13,319
said it was in pure form

1186
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,358
ah very interesting and out of curiosity

1187
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:17,639
did you end up picking up any other

1188
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,920
seeds on that trip that ended up being

1189
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:22,379
like a memorable variety or was it

1190
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,980
really just a haze that cut it

1191
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,720
there was 27 varieties I brought back I

1192
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,818
remember and

1193
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,338
um it was just a haze I ended up keeping

1194
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:35,940
in the end my friend my friend liked one

1195
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:38,519
of the one of the early skunks uh that

1196
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,460
that I think Sam had at the time through

1197
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:43,500
positronics and uh that was a plant that

1198
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,659
that delivered up here you know most

1199
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,000
people are harvesting beginning to

1200
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:49,980
mid-october and this this thing was out

1201
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,800
of the ground by you know by

1202
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,780
mid-september or something and uh and

1203
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,240
that meant a lot up here you know in

1204
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,819
extra months of of not having to evade

1205
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,318
camp and stuff you know so he really

1206
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:03,239
liked that one it wasn't particularly

1207
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:05,219
good smoke or anything but it made him a

1208
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:06,799
lot of money you know it was certainly a

1209
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:10,199
good grower

1210
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,519
ah interesting interesting okay and so

1211
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:13,439
when you got back and you're growing

1212
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,659
them out what was it like that first

1213
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,679
time do you remember like the funeral

1214
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:22,739
hunt oh my my friends still have the

1215
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,899
songs were created about it and like I

1216
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:27,598
said you know we tried to grow these

1217
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:30,059
things in kind of our normal Shady spots

1218
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,160
and stuff and and none of them produced

1219
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:34,679
anything close to decent bud you know

1220
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,078
these things are used to being selected

1221
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:40,019
under lights and stuff you know you know

1222
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,818
they work really well indoors but you

1223
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:45,480
can't take that [Â __Â ] under the shade man

1224
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:48,300
it just it it grows stuff that that

1225
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,639
buyers would even back then you know

1226
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,380
would turn their nose up out and back

1227
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,539
then people would take anything you know

1228
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,960
if they were lucky to know a grower kind

1229
00:48:54,539 --> 00:49:00,420
of thing but uh but yeah oh it got me

1230
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,980
mad you know it was horrible it was a

1231
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,400
horrible experience I've hated

1232
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:07,500
everything from from Holland since just

1233
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,000
just kidding

1234
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,460
okay

1235
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,639
what was it like when so I'm assuming

1236
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,199
you you like F2 them and and then grew

1237
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,059
him again and like that was when you

1238
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,559
found sort of the magic or how did that

1239
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,179
happen when you actually were able to

1240
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:22,440
get something good off it and were like

1241
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:25,259
this is it

1242
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,500
I I think I had like 60 seeds or

1243
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:31,800
something I don't know uh uh I think uh

1244
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,838
positronics sold 15 seats per pack back

1245
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,900
then I had like four of them so I had

1246
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,699
60. and I think I grew up 10 the first

1247
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,880
year and I found a really [Â __Â ] good

1248
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:43,739
plant and I was like holy [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

1249
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,019
you know this stuff is really [Â __Â ]

1250
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:48,179
good it was nothing like the haze I was

1251
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:50,039
smoking on the street in Amsterdam

1252
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:52,500
though you know that was more of the

1253
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:54,119
that one that that uh you know that

1254
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,579
champ T and Neville and all them work

1255
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:00,240
with which is a it was more of a kind of

1256
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:02,700
leathery uh incensey thing going on teak

1257
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,799
wood kind of a flavor

1258
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,059
um and the one I had grew was totally

1259
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,099
different I was like what the hell is

1260
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:11,219
this this isn't the [Â __Â ] I was smoking

1261
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:13,559
but uh but uh yeah Double Take [Â __Â ] but

1262
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:15,838
it's really [Â __Â ] good

1263
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,219
um and said so I knew that there was

1264
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,900
good stuff in it but I didn't save a

1265
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:20,399
clone I didn't do any breeding I was

1266
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,200
like [Â __Â ] later I was like I wish I

1267
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,539
didn't even grow those out because I

1268
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,179
immediately went to open pollination out

1269
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:29,159
of that and made more seeds

1270
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:31,139
um with the 50 Associates or whatever I

1271
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,598
had left uh

1272
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:36,598
and I've you know I've just open

1273
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,838
pollinated since then but it did start

1274
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:43,160
with the population at 50 I think and um

1275
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:45,358
or something like that uh lovely

1276
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:47,399
something like that but if I was open

1277
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,440
pollinated them and I tried to grow it

1278
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,260
in various you know I've done half same

1279
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,539
selection on it and I've tried to you

1280
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,579
know collect seeds for only from my

1281
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:58,259
favorite you know and you know so you're

1282
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:00,480
basically saving seeds from you know

1283
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,640
your mail pollen mix on

1284
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,199
all these different Haze girls in a

1285
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,058
greenhouse and whichever your favorite

1286
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:09,299
is you know set aside those seeds from

1287
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:13,680
it and stuff so we have said half said

1288
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:16,079
because of the male pollen mix but um

1289
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,598
and you know I don't know I've never

1290
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,880
really made any progress with it to be

1291
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,740
honest you know it still sits there kind

1292
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,380
of right where it was at five percent

1293
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:28,139
kick your ass and and and a whole bunch

1294
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,640
of hay and you know a few ones other

1295
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,500
ones that aren't worth writing at home

1296
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:33,539
about but you thought were going to be

1297
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,280
good and

1298
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:38,099
um but that small percentage is awesome

1299
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,460
so so because I've never made any any

1300
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:43,680
progress with it if I'm you know going

1301
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,260
to grow some out

1302
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,940
um I I reach for the open pollination

1303
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:51,300
[Â __Â ] you know because it's less bread

1304
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:52,740
and um it has the same damn ratio as as

1305
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,740
anything that I tried to make any

1306
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:58,199
progress with so I hold more value on

1307
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:01,439
the open pollination sheet stock uh

1308
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:04,139
paste that I have

1309
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,059
that's brilliant before we jump into

1310
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:08,639
some open pollination stuff I've got to

1311
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:11,280
ask that first time you ran them that

1312
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,900
key that killer plant you got have you

1313
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,280
like how would you describe that because

1314
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,539
you said you know it was different to

1315
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,400
the Amsterdam stuff how would you

1316
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:19,858
describe it and have you seen that

1317
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,800
phenotype pop up again since then

1318
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:26,039
sure yeah I mean that's uh when it's on

1319
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,079
when when it's good that it's a really

1320
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:30,659
really good good smoke it's just

1321
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,839
incredibly potent like um

1322
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:35,279
you know geez I've walked into the

1323
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:36,900
bathroom and looked at myself in the

1324
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,119
mirror and like talked to myself and say

1325
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,119
well I'm high I'm so [Â __Â ] high oh my

1326
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:45,059
God and you know I and uh and that's

1327
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:46,740
really silly [Â __Â ] you know I mean uh and

1328
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,240
that there's there's nothing else out

1329
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:51,058
there that'll make you do that kind of

1330
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,279
stuff and and you you'll be you know

1331
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:54,780
looking around for your telephone using

1332
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,440
the flashlight on your [Â __Â ] telephone

1333
00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:00,300
you know where's my phone it's in your

1334
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,579
hand right and you [Â __Â ] and then

1335
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,760
you'll just you just have these moments

1336
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:08,818
of holy [Â __Â ] I'm [Â __Â ] high

1337
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,040
um and and Hayes is really uh

1338
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:12,779
it you know it's it's number one at

1339
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,818
doing that to you

1340
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,980
that's brilliant what sort of flavor is

1341
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:19,318
interpaints did I have

1342
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,318
that's like I thought I just I just call

1343
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:23,818
it really Thai like it's kind of citrusy

1344
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:25,739
there's some there's a bunch of weird

1345
00:53:23,818 --> 00:53:28,259
stuff going on in Hayes I call it a high

1346
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:30,179
school metal shop like there's stems

1347
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,040
will will smell like almost like metal

1348
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:34,980
like a high school metal shop like oil

1349
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:37,679
you know machine oil and stuff oh it's

1350
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,260
got some really weird evil kind of

1351
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,480
smells going on but the ones that I

1352
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,300
usually gravitate towards will have a

1353
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,519
have a citrusy kind of uh you know

1354
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:51,420
dominant profile

1355
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:53,280
oh lovely that sends right up my alley

1356
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,838
I wanted to delve into the open

1357
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,180
pollination stuff because as you

1358
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:58,739
mentioned it's uh one of your preferred

1359
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:01,440
breeding techniques at least with the

1360
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:03,239
haze how do you go through and do an

1361
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,179
open pollination on the technical level

1362
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:08,279
do you do you color any plants what sort

1363
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:11,058
of criteria would you use if you were

1364
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,059
going to cut anything

1365
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:18,240
sure yeah but um I would uh well I

1366
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,099
I would say I try to shoot for you know

1367
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,858
at least 100 plants in an open

1368
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:25,559
pollination uh so it's not to back

1369
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:27,539
yourself in too much of a corner

1370
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,160
um or as many as you can you know if you

1371
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:29,880
could do more great you know more is

1372
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:31,858
better

1373
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,920
you know so you're not so you're not

1374
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:37,318
losing anything that you want to keep

1375
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,960
um but you know but there's a couple of

1376
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:42,358
instances also where you know you don't

1377
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,280
want the the

1378
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,380
the population of sway in any One

1379
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,920
Direction like if I have an early male

1380
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:52,200
that's coming along right and uh this

1381
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,300
guy's about ready to shoot his load and

1382
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:56,519
every other male in the damn room is is

1383
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,940
behind him I'll go ahead and top that

1384
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:02,818
mail and cut his input back you know

1385
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,280
lessen his his effect I don't want him

1386
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:06,900
robbing them having a lion share a

1387
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,359
pollination in the room just because he

1388
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,579
was earlier you know that that that's

1389
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,500
you know it's leaving out too too many

1390
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,260
other plants that you probably are going

1391
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,480
to want there in the end you know

1392
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:21,780
yeah brilliant brilliant that makes

1393
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,400
sense and do you pay much attention to

1394
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,920
like runs or anything like you know

1395
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,838
things that are like sort of lacking in

1396
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,000
compared to the others or you're not too

1397
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,940
fussed about that you just let it all go

1398
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,619
yeah okay I I include them

1399
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,019
I include them

1400
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:39,660
you know they might they could who the

1401
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:41,639
[Â __Â ] knows you know they there might be

1402
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:43,379
correlations that we have no [Â __Â ]

1403
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:46,759
idea about

1404
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:49,559
um and uh it's you know

1405
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:52,140
have you has anybody in the world ever

1406
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:54,599
that you know seen this massive yielding

1407
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:57,299
perfect plant that also happens to rip

1408
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,579
your head off you know and it seems like

1409
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,200
they shouldn't be you know it shouldn't

1410
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:03,180
you know I mean it's not even like

1411
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,039
hitting the lotto you just don't see

1412
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:07,039
them you know they're [Â __Â ] unicorns

1413
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,838
so um

1414
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:11,818
I don't know I'm not gonna leave them

1415
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:13,619
out I'm gonna I'm gonna let them I'm

1416
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:15,599
gonna let him do their thing and and you

1417
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:17,160
know their their input would be small

1418
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,119
right because they're just a [Â __Â ]

1419
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,679
runt

1420
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:21,539
yeah that's an interesting way to think

1421
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,759
about it so you're not too worried about

1422
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:25,259
[Â __Â ] up the population at all what

1423
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,059
you're what you're worried about when

1424
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:30,359
you're doing this including everything

1425
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:31,980
that you possibly can uh as big as

1426
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:34,619
numbers as possible and just stand back

1427
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,240
and just and just let that happen though

1428
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:38,160
too you have to kind of you know like I

1429
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,838
said you have to guard that like an

1430
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:43,558
early male doesn't pollinate everything

1431
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:46,199
you know or you know uh weeks before the

1432
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:48,480
other mail said any pollen that that

1433
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,098
would be catastrophe you know so that's

1434
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,719
the one thing I do keep an eye out is

1435
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:53,760
early emails and I'll just cut them back

1436
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:55,618
a little bit I'll turn them into a runt

1437
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,940
I'll say just because you're early you

1438
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:59,519
know it doesn't doesn't mean you get to

1439
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:02,460
lie and share of being a daddy

1440
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:05,039
you know and I think that gives you a

1441
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:07,079
nice uh you know mix of genetics in in

1442
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,358
the open pollination

1443
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:11,579
yeah definitely definitely that's good

1444
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,139
to hear that you are capable in and yeah

1445
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:15,180
I think a lot of people would sort of

1446
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:16,558
curl those early ones so that's I'm

1447
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:18,118
going to give that a go next time I do

1448
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,380
an open pollination it's just topping it

1449
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:21,900
but leaving it in there because you

1450
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,460
still get that mix I like that yeah you

1451
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,079
can you can mess with there if

1452
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,760
anything's you know looks like it's

1453
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:28,800
going to get the giant share of

1454
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,960
pollination you know you can just you

1455
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,140
know lessen that plant's input really

1456
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,358
easy with a pair of [Â __Â ] scissors in

1457
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:39,539
the room you know

1458
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:41,699
yeah yeah yeah yeah just to loop back to

1459
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:43,800
Haze for a second you know it seems like

1460
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:46,919
it's had this massive Resurgence

1461
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:49,740
probably around the time Neville passed

1462
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,900
it started to gain a lot of traction and

1463
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:53,879
I think we're now starting to see more

1464
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,039
and more hazes come out of the Woodworks

1465
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,480
why do you think Haze is becoming so

1466
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,338
popular do you think it's just people

1467
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,199
are realizing there are these really

1468
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:03,239
special phenos

1469
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:07,078
yeah the Market's just coming around

1470
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:08,759
again you know we we're probably you

1471
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,339
know it was it was been super popular

1472
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,380
before but and then everybody [Â __Â ]

1473
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:14,759
had it and then the [Â __Â ] buyers said

1474
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,338
hey man we don't want anything but

1475
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,859
[Â __Â ] this

1476
00:58:16,338 --> 00:58:21,719
you know great plants come along and

1477
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:23,400
that's what happens to them and they get

1478
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,980
[Â __Â ] canned because there's pressure

1479
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,800
coming from outside to deliver something

1480
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:31,199
else but here's what happens with the

1481
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,480
really good ones they come back you know

1482
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,399
a couple years later when everybody gets

1483
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,619
sick of whatever the newest kid on the

1484
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,059
Block is these these buyers and

1485
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:40,440
customers so they'll come back and

1486
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:43,440
they'll say hey man you got into that

1487
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,079
[Â __Â ] old [Â __Â ] still you know they

1488
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,880
they miss it they have they have to you

1489
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,640
know come around in their head that this

1490
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,039
this was a really [Â __Â ] good plant and

1491
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:55,558
Hayes is it really is you know it's one

1492
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,779
of the one of the best plants in you

1493
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:00,119
know in modern history for sure with the

1494
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,819
zero doubt maybe the best

1495
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,619
wow I like that I love that you have

1496
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:07,739
such a passion for it and a little bit

1497
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:09,180
earlier you did reference nl5 Haze I

1498
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:11,039
would love to hear your thoughts in

1499
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:12,539
terms of like do you think they're

1500
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,519
comparable or are they just totally

1501
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:18,000
different beasts in your mind

1502
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:20,460
well in most categories they're better

1503
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,280
um uh you know I mean they certainly any

1504
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,740
hybrid will certainly yield better

1505
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,680
um I've seen them have big giant heads

1506
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:30,479
you know our friend uh of the community

1507
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:32,639
what's his name obsolete I've seen some

1508
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,159
incredible macros with these big giant

1509
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,440
heads so there's some great parents in

1510
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:39,179
there there's dear of doubt and I smoke

1511
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,619
some that completely ripped my head off

1512
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:42,719
too

1513
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:45,000
um I think they're both great I think

1514
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,159
there's great stuff and and all of the

1515
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,159
those Haze lines you know you just have

1516
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:52,440
to be willing to run run the numbers and

1517
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:55,259
have you tried any of the current

1518
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,700
popular ones like uh the pith for the

1519
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:00,180
Cuban black Haze

1520
00:59:56,699 --> 01:00:00,960
no I haven't not neither one of those

1521
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,699
um

1522
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,980
that I know of

1523
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:08,338
I know a couple of people who have had

1524
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:10,318
it and I've been meaning to

1525
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:14,219
um but when when I hear the stuff

1526
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:16,199
described it sounds a lot like the stuff

1527
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:19,439
that I was smoking out of the coffee

1528
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:24,118
shops in it you know in Amsterdam and in

1529
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,679
in 94 to 894 early 95. yeah definitely I

1530
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,140
think you mentioned it being like

1531
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,578
incense here and that is how these Haze

1532
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:32,400
cuts are described

1533
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:35,039
yeah and and the stuff was really Spacey

1534
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,280
too you know it's a really cool a really

1535
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:40,199
cool Visual and and audio uh kind of

1536
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,140
trippy High

1537
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:45,960
interesting and can we maybe expect to

1538
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:48,659
see some Haze seeds being offered from

1539
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,838
you at some point in the future

1540
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:54,960
well I like the igf finding a uh yeah

1541
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:57,239
I'll be running Haze always you know I

1542
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,400
mean I'm not gonna not gonna not grow

1543
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:01,078
some Haze and now it's like I said now

1544
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,298
is a great time to do it because the

1545
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:04,920
Market's so [Â __Â ] up anyway you know

1546
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:08,000
you can kind of take a little vacation

1547
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,680
and do what you really want to do

1548
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,260
actually I want to care about finding I

1549
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:16,279
have plenty eight seed or or more uh

1550
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,720
excited about finding a clown

1551
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,420
you know because I've never really done

1552
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,239
it never never saved a haze clone and

1553
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:27,000
[Â __Â ] I've seen so many of them go by

1554
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,259
from seed that I should have saved you

1555
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,039
know

1556
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,859
um

1557
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:36,719
and you know it'd be a pain in the butt

1558
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:39,539
to grow or even from even from clone but

1559
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:43,318
um why not you know why not it's pretty

1560
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:46,079
[Â __Â ] special I I think uh it Stacks

1561
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:48,358
up against anything anything

1562
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,660
um when it's when it's on

1563
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:53,460
uh okay and like is your idea to breed

1564
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:56,179
with it or like sort of disseminate it

1565
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,179
out to the community

1566
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:01,500
um yeah I would love to have it you know

1567
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,579
out in people's hands uh and I don't

1568
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,039
know if I would agree with it I think

1569
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:06,660
I'd stick with hey that I'm just and and

1570
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,358
all of my old lines I just stick with

1571
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:11,699
open pollination and least frequently as

1572
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:15,000
possible and you know the best possible

1573
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:19,078
storage in you know in the interim

1574
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,940
yeah definitely I've seen you post about

1575
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,220
um your seed storage online how do you

1576
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,200
like to store seeds long term

1577
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:26,039
well we don't have much of a choice up

1578
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,578
here

1579
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:29,219
um

1580
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:31,680
uh we bury them I know the price under

1581
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:34,199
the price levels under the you know the

1582
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,078
price level in different areas will be

1583
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:39,598
different gaps here it's about I don't

1584
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,760
know two and a half three p so you dig a

1585
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,200
hole about three feet deep and get an

1586
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,339
army

1587
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:50,179
um you know an ammo can has a good seal

1588
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:52,679
on it and such to keep ammunition dry

1589
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:55,558
those are good storage containers for

1590
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:58,078
for barium seed and it's about you know

1591
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:00,599
it's not as good as a refrigerator but

1592
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,519
it's about you know I think 55 degrees

1593
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:05,160
Fahrenheit or something Earth

1594
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:07,679
temperature and it doesn't vary a lot

1595
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:10,440
from Summer to Winter it doesn't freeze

1596
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,879
and it doesn't bake during the summer so

1597
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,400
it's a it's a

1598
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:18,180
about like burying them and King Tut's

1599
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:20,818
tomb I guess that's a pretty good option

1600
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:22,440
um but it's but refrigerator would be

1601
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:24,239
better but we were always concerned

1602
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,639
about getting busted you know back in

1603
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:29,279
the old days you get busted and that and

1604
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,139
they take everything like that and so

1605
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,240
you didn't want to have them around the

1606
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:34,858
house you want any nothing safe until

1607
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,159
it's in the Bank of the woods around

1608
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:39,960
here you know

1609
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:42,779
we bury everything that has any value

1610
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,880
and my seed stash is always coming to

1611
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,700
that category I keep two of them I keep

1612
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,440
another ammo can that's not buried that

1613
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:51,598
you know kind of a Remnant seed thing

1614
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,760
that I use for handing out and sanding

1615
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,619
out and stuff like that but it doesn't

1616
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,900
keep as well as the stuff that I bury

1617
01:03:55,619 --> 01:04:00,240
and let's set there

1618
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,760
ah and do you have like a certain time

1619
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,919
frame you like to like you know every

1620
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,380
five years I restock it or like what how

1621
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:10,440
do you do it do a germ test you know

1622
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:13,200
germination test and and write down what

1623
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,480
percentage you got up you know every

1624
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:19,078
five years or something

1625
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,480
um I you know start well they'll go 20

1626
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:23,940
years at least

1627
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:28,559
um I usually try to open pollinate after

1628
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:31,740
about 10 years when when uh when or when

1629
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:33,599
whenever you get close to 50 you know

1630
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:36,000
you have a germ test that's down to 60

1631
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,500
or something you better get you better

1632
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,940
get going again

1633
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:43,739
yeah so so that makes sense and you

1634
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,900
referenced a few questions ago you know

1635
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:49,318
that like popular Australians come back

1636
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:51,660
in fashion and I wanted to know it seems

1637
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:54,119
like the peak or maybe just over the

1638
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:56,639
peak of uh the road kill skunk Obsession

1639
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:58,260
did you ever have any experience with it

1640
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,699
and if so do you think it's worth the

1641
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,760
hype

1642
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:05,578
oh these these details were filled with

1643
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,920
all that stuff back in the day

1644
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:11,099
um it was super you know it was

1645
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:14,700
everywhere you know most of the gaddies

1646
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:16,380
and and Pakistan we came up in here the

1647
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:19,379
broad leaves they came up through here

1648
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:22,798
remote most of it I would say was skunk

1649
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:26,039
uh was very skunky you know old school

1650
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:28,019
in the old school wet manner uh or a

1651
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:31,079
definition rather

1652
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:33,239
um but you know everybody brought away

1653
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:37,019
with it away from it you know that

1654
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:39,358
that's the reality and uh and they

1655
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:41,280
wouldn't have if it was worth the hype

1656
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:44,219
now would they

1657
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,859
um I I think that uh it's just not a

1658
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:49,679
very exciting uh

1659
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:52,078
profile really to be honest with you you

1660
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:55,199
know because other ones in the end for

1661
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,240
the most part have won the day and uh

1662
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:00,000
and for one reason or another you know

1663
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:01,919
they're they're uh there's only a few of

1664
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,719
them around today you know they can't

1665
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,659
and they're like chems and you know the

1666
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:09,598
and and you know Diesel and stuff like

1667
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:12,659
that have it's getting close to to what

1668
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,940
these guys are talking about but uh it's

1669
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:17,818
different it's way more evil you know

1670
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:22,619
the the old skunk wasn't so evil as any

1671
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:25,679
as these new popular uh uh cuts

1672
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:28,500
yeah interesting okay so because like

1673
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:30,838
what I've heard a lot of is that the the

1674
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,940
terp profile some people have found

1675
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:35,400
things similar but they're often like

1676
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:37,619
not super potent would you say that was

1677
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,900
your experience with it yeah I think

1678
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:42,119
that that's the reason that everybody or

1679
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:44,338
you know the majority of it got bred out

1680
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,500
of the gene pool is because it wasn't

1681
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:49,139
the bag that got emptied perished you

1682
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:51,420
know out of your samples

1683
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:54,900
um just it didn't it didn't take some

1684
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:56,700
important boxes that and back then we

1685
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,559
weren't growing for the market or what

1686
01:06:56,699 --> 01:07:00,000
the buyers said that they wanted back

1687
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,980
then we could grow whatever we wanted

1688
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,780
you know because buyers would come up

1689
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:05,760
here they would buy whatever the [Â __Â ]

1690
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,220
you had they were lucky to know a grower

1691
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,980
you know uh so back then we had this

1692
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:14,038
freedom to to to to to grow what we

1693
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:15,719
wanted you know what we liked and and

1694
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:17,839
and we could sell anything that we

1695
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:20,159
wanted no problem that's just gonna sell

1696
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:22,500
but you could actually grow what you

1697
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:25,078
wanted you know and that's that's kind

1698
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:27,239
of like what I'm excited about the way

1699
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:29,519
the industry is now and and the prices

1700
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:31,798
are so far down it's getting really

1701
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:34,259
close to that again you can just you can

1702
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,239
just grow whatever the [Â __Â ] you want you

1703
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:37,740
know

1704
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:40,439
I like that

1705
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:42,538
yeah yeah and I mean I remember you you

1706
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,059
said a comment to me that sort of left a

1707
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:47,039
lasting impression which was like the

1708
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:49,019
bag of weed sets the ticket and I think

1709
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,359
the question for a lot of Growers and

1710
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:54,480
what they're wondering is like what can

1711
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,519
I do to find something that's gonna be

1712
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,139
able to do that like what's going to be

1713
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,280
impressive enough that it sets its own

1714
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:01,279
ticket do you have any advice

1715
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:06,480
I think well I think historically you

1716
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:09,299
know tyweed did it when it started

1717
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,760
getting imported uh

1718
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:14,880
um you know by ships into the harbors

1719
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:18,179
here on the West Coast you know back in

1720
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,679
the late 70s or something it it came

1721
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:21,000
along it was like eighteen hundred

1722
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,219
dollars

1723
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,719
um when everything else was like you

1724
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:28,020
know two or three hundred dollars at the

1725
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:30,480
time tyweed certainly hit America by

1726
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,219
storm and and it was able to ride its

1727
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:35,519
own ticket as far as how much it's worth

1728
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:37,020
I think Hayes can do the same and I

1729
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,600
don't see anything else doing it really

1730
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:41,640
you know but it certainly you know you

1731
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,120
did that whole New York that back East

1732
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:47,579
Hayes stuff you know that stuff uh could

1733
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:50,939
be pretty expensive you know uh

1734
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:53,698
certainly uh it was a pretty Elite stuff

1735
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:56,039
to get a hold of and and people willing

1736
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:58,198
to pay a lot of money for it you know

1737
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:01,019
you'll hear Clark uh talk in the old

1738
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:03,719
days how you know like even way back

1739
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:05,880
when Hayes was going for like 400 bucks

1740
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:09,000
an ounce or something something like

1741
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,679
that I think he can do that today I

1742
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,020
think if you went out and found a

1743
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:15,600
kick-ass Haze clone you could pretty

1744
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:18,600
much just decide what you were going to

1745
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,100
sell it for and and and and people would

1746
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,560
buy it

1747
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,838
that's really interesting I really like

1748
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,719
that because it sort of flies in the

1749
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:29,278
face of what would intuitively seem like

1750
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:31,798
the right thing which like you might

1751
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,259
think to yourself oh I need to like make

1752
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:36,960
my own thing and like become unique

1753
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:38,399
through that but it's sort of like not

1754
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,480
necessarily going to guarantee you're

1755
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,219
going to get like a really good end

1756
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:43,559
product whereas with the haze as you

1757
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:45,179
said like it's tried and tested and no

1758
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,460
one's feeling that Niche right now so

1759
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,500
it's almost like a space in the market

1760
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,420
waiting to be filled

1761
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,759
right well I'm not thinking about it

1762
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,520
from that angle really about the market

1763
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,319
but I I the you know the reason that you

1764
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,060
could do that with stuff like this is

1765
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,759
because it's just so much [Â __Â ] better

1766
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:04,920
than anything out there

1767
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:07,079
um you know and introducing seed is one

1768
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,060
thing but when you introduce hey Steve

1769
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:11,698
you're introducing you know this big

1770
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:14,520
giant percentage of hay to people that's

1771
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:16,019
that's you know it's like smoking rope

1772
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,660
um you know and that's you know that's

1773
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:21,480
not that's not so valuable but if you

1774
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:24,420
but if you'd introduced a haze clone

1775
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:25,919
that you know or that was just epic well

1776
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,880
now you're doing something for society

1777
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,039
you know

1778
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,179
are you now you're uh now you're doing

1779
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,579
well

1780
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:35,039
definitely and for anyone out there

1781
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:36,600
who's feeling particularly inspired by

1782
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:38,939
listening to this do you have any

1783
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,199
recommendations for growing Haze indoor

1784
01:10:38,939 --> 01:10:44,039
or like do you just like I don't

1785
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:46,559
recommend that I try my good friend I

1786
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:50,039
guess so CBF he grows and he's been

1787
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:53,219
growing it indoors so I never have

1788
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:56,039
I've already grown it in a greenhouse

1789
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:59,340
um but CBS grew a lot of this of my seed

1790
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:00,960
indoors over the years and uh I think he

1791
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,400
just tried to flower it out as fast as

1792
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,760
he can and it's still going to be you

1793
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:07,500
know six foot plus two meters plus oh no

1794
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,719
matter what you do

1795
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,158
um kind of thing and it just becomes a

1796
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:14,158
jungle

1797
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:16,399
or just good luck you know I guess just

1798
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:20,099
just

1799
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:22,799
it's I mean now from clone you know if

1800
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:25,140
you you know just started flowering a

1801
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,119
clone a rooted clone that's probably

1802
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:28,800
where it's at you know and then I bet

1803
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:30,658
you could finish it up under five feet

1804
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,699
or so

1805
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:35,158
but growing it from seed good luck

1806
01:11:32,698 --> 01:11:36,839
because that thing it's not you know

1807
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:39,359
it's not even going to start flowering

1808
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,980
for for what you know two months if

1809
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:42,779
you're lucky and then and then it's

1810
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:44,459
gonna and then it's Gonna Keep

1811
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:46,439
stretching for like two months after

1812
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:48,500
that and

1813
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:53,219
um it's a nightmare

1814
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:55,920
uh to not just let go you know go for it

1815
01:11:53,219 --> 01:11:59,279
wow I can only imagine just these most

1816
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,640
monstrous trees at the end of it all uh

1817
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:04,679
what about Outdoors okay

1818
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:07,560
15 20 feet you know

1819
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:10,079
um if you I've never even really grown

1820
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,840
it to to try to see how big I can grow

1821
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:16,140
it with that type of plant they they get

1822
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:19,319
so big you know it'll get you know huge

1823
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:21,719
and in six months so like a life cycle

1824
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:23,759
if you started in in the summer I can't

1825
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:26,579
imagine what it would be like like you

1826
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:29,520
know starting it in in the spring and

1827
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:31,859
letting it have all summer and and then

1828
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,320
stretch out through [Â __Â ] September

1829
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:35,939
and October and all that and then you

1830
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:39,000
know finally come in and it's probably

1831
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:42,000
November late November or even in this

1832
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,698
December the plant would be huge it

1833
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,060
would be huge several meters you know

1834
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:50,299
probably four four or five I don't know

1835
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:53,699
six meters maybe

1836
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:56,520
I can't I could totally imagine I grew

1837
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:59,698
like that up here too it would get huge

1838
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,500
setting records and I mean you grow a

1839
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:03,059
lot of Outdoors so I'm assuming you're

1840
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,219
growing in soil can you give us a bit of

1841
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:06,840
a rundown of how you grow like what sort

1842
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:08,880
of amendments do you use anything

1843
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,920
interesting

1844
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,579
I've always been a big fan of chicken

1845
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:17,579
[Â __Â ] Outdoors um you know it's a it's a

1846
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:19,979
very balanced food and it lasts about

1847
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:21,420
three months or something you know and

1848
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:24,839
that's a pretty good that's a pretty

1849
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:27,359
good uh amount of time

1850
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:29,760
um I like bone meal and chicken [Â __Â ] but

1851
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,859
I haven't grown these large outdoor

1852
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,380
plants you know most of most of

1853
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:37,559
everybody including myself have just

1854
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:41,039
been doing depths for years like depths

1855
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,159
and and greenhouses you know um

1856
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:46,019
but uh and that's an even shorter

1857
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:49,019
lifespan so

1858
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,880
um you know we're going that would be

1859
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:54,600
different but for the long outdoor

1860
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:57,659
season I like chicken [Â __Â ] and bone meal

1861
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:00,060
beautiful beautiful and do you do like

1862
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:01,259
uh like a super soil sort of thing in

1863
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,239
the sense that you put that at the

1864
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:05,039
bottom and then some regular soil on top

1865
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:07,439
and then the plants on top of that or is

1866
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:09,420
it just that's the whole medium

1867
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,759
that's just kind of what I start out

1868
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:15,600
with and and then you know I'll do some

1869
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:19,920
feeding and of of like fish and

1870
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:23,219
and liquid you know I've uh various

1871
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,199
organic bottle nutrients you know a

1872
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:26,939
couple of times on the outdoors but but

1873
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:28,919
in the uh

1874
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:30,539
forgot it's been years since I've really

1875
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,060
grown Outdoors my you know my outdoor

1876
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:35,460
pots now are filled with Mama plants to

1877
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:38,480
take freaking cuts off of for the second

1878
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:41,460
run on the tight tips

1879
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:43,439
so what sort of uh feeding and soil

1880
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:45,119
regime do you use for when you're doing

1881
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,419
light depth

1882
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:50,819
oh like a you would use these these

1883
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:52,079
injectors are real popular where uh you

1884
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,939
know you grab them just grab some

1885
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:58,619
age-old organic or something you know

1886
01:14:53,939 --> 01:15:01,799
one of the liquid uh organic fertilizers

1887
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:04,019
and use these these injectors

1888
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,840
um where where it does it auto mixes you

1889
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:09,440
know with the hose yeah and uh you can

1890
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:12,239
just feed really easy that way

1891
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:14,399
you know the old days of sit running

1892
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:17,519
around with Granny cams and dipping them

1893
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:21,000
into a slurry of of you know 55 gallon

1894
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:25,320
barrels filled with you know tea are

1895
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:30,359
over you know I love it Modern Problems

1896
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:32,219
require modern solutions yeah exactly

1897
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:34,799
and you're asking about soil and stuff

1898
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:36,960
yeah and I use grow bags some some

1899
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,900
people used to you know make beds and

1900
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,880
stuff but my vegetable always scared me

1901
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:44,219
a little bit you know I mean they're

1902
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,020
really easy to prep and stuff because

1903
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:47,939
you can just run a rototiller over the

1904
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:49,560
thing you know and and tell in some

1905
01:15:47,939 --> 01:15:53,399
amendments you know each year or

1906
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:55,679
whatever but uh but pathogen ripping

1907
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:58,920
through there or or Vermin ripping

1908
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:00,179
through there you know you get a bowl or

1909
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,219
something ripping through your and

1910
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:04,380
they're like you'll be like you know

1911
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:08,039
Gophers tearing up your you know Bugs

1912
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:11,219
Bunny cartoons you know any type of soil

1913
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:15,719
borne pathogen or Critter can wreak

1914
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:18,719
havoc in a in a in a raised bed uh once

1915
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:21,179
he gets in there so I I like the I like

1916
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:24,719
I like to use grow bags group for that

1917
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:26,880
uh reason but I do use soil but if I get

1918
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:30,359
a problem and grow bags it's isolated to

1919
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:33,060
that One Singular bag you know but then

1920
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:34,679
and feeding it becomes a nightmare you

1921
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,420
know because you can't just run grip

1922
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:38,460
tape or whatever overgrow bags you have

1923
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:41,699
to get a hose on it or you know or drip

1924
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:43,920
line or something else but um

1925
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:45,059
so those injectors work out really well

1926
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,940
for that

1927
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:50,460
yeah definitely the Automation and the

1928
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:52,379
reduction of Labor is hugely important I

1929
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:55,679
was curious though in your depths do you

1930
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:58,140
use any external lighting

1931
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,500
um you know we always use fluorescence

1932
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:03,300
in the past and and uh but everybody's

1933
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,819
using these string lights now and and

1934
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:07,739
they seem to work as as you know as dim

1935
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:10,439
as they are they hardly got give up any

1936
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:13,019
light and they use you know almost no

1937
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:15,779
electricity you know the these string

1938
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:17,760
lights are like LED strings for having

1939
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:19,859
cocktail parties in the suburbs or

1940
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,860
whatever an amazingly low amount of

1941
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:24,179
light yeah we'll keep them in bed uh

1942
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:26,759
when you when you when you get that

1943
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:28,619
early jump in the spring and then the

1944
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,360
second one the hours are long enough

1945
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:34,198
that you're not worried about lighting

1946
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:34,759
you know and uh everybody's everybody

1947
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:37,379
everybody

1948
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,300
was talking about mixed lighting these

1949
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,760
days and stuff where if they try to you

1950
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,440
know go too early or something they'll

1951
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,539
have some bigger Lighting systems in

1952
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:48,238
there to help it along and then play it

1953
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:50,698
up like at some hybrid system of indoor

1954
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:52,619
but that's you know you don't need to do

1955
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:54,119
that if you grab a bigger chunk of the

1956
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:58,679
good growing season

1957
01:17:54,119 --> 01:18:00,840
yeah definitely definitely so I would

1958
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:02,880
love to jump into some of the older

1959
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:05,579
history and the early stuff so let's go

1960
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,460
back to the start tell me what was your

1961
01:18:05,579 --> 01:18:12,779
first experience with cannabis

1962
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:16,859
oh God I was 14 years old and um I've

1963
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:18,658
smoked out of a can pipe with uh with a

1964
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:21,658
couple of my friends who I've known

1965
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:23,099
since you know Junior High and and had

1966
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:25,079
brought both of them up to the mountain

1967
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:27,179
and we've all done the same thing you

1968
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:27,960
know I've known them forever

1969
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:29,640
um

1970
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,679
and they're and they're still up here or

1971
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,920
one of them is but they both own

1972
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,779
property up here and such you know

1973
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:39,840
um and that started when I was 14.

1974
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:43,019
probably Mexican weed some shitty

1975
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:46,199
[Â __Â ] northern northern Mexican weed

1976
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:49,980
you know Brown Town back in you know in

1977
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:52,259
the suburbs of LA or the or the South

1978
01:18:49,979 --> 01:18:54,178
Bay on the coast there

1979
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:56,880
um

1980
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:58,380
about of Los Angeles that's all he had

1981
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,179
back then you know so you'd get some

1982
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:02,100
good green Bud occasionally but most

1983
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:03,239
people were smoking Mexican weed back

1984
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,460
then

1985
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:07,399
yeah interesting and did it have a

1986
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:11,000
memorable impact on you

1987
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:11,000
well I liked it

1988
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,380
yeah I like it a lot you know and I

1989
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:18,658
would probably smoke the next day too

1990
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,880
and the day after that the day after

1991
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:21,779
that for a long time

1992
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,539
um

1993
01:19:21,779 --> 01:19:27,359
you know that was uh

1994
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:30,420
about 40 years ago now I guess

1995
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:32,639
yeah well and then so what was your

1996
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:35,520
progression like then did you just begin

1997
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,320
to smoke more and eventually you decided

1998
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,440
you wanted to start growing like what

1999
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:43,679
was the transition from casual smoker to

2000
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:47,519
the next level for you

2001
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:50,520
um being being impressed Enough by that

2002
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,780
Thai weed to to that chocolate tie that

2003
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,420
used to go around in Los Angeles

2004
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:57,359
probably came into Long Beach Harbor I

2005
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:59,399
think and and it was around those beach

2006
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:02,158
cities uh

2007
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:05,879
of Los Angeles and it was good enough

2008
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:08,399
and at the same time books were coming

2009
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,500
out you know to teach the backyard

2010
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:13,859
Growers of the 70s to actually how to

2011
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:15,960
grow some bud you know before that there

2012
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:19,799
were like smoking leaves and [Â __Â ] it was

2013
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:23,640
pretty funny but um but I it was a book

2014
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:27,060
uh the Primo plan Jerry Garcia's wife uh

2015
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:29,219
we call her Mountain girl back then

2016
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:31,020
um I had written this book to Primo

2017
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:34,079
plant that you know ran through you know

2018
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:37,020
how to grow and how to you know call the

2019
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:39,479
males and all that and and that and

2020
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:42,540
along with that Thai weed

2021
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:45,658
um you know that's what I wanted to grow

2022
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:47,460
and so yeah I was over it I was over I

2023
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:50,460
used to work for this guy that had this

2024
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:52,260
Thai weed and he had this big Gardener

2025
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:55,140
you know it was a landscaping business

2026
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:57,420
the guy loved flowers and all that and

2027
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:00,000
he had this big giant rooftop deck and

2028
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:02,880
we would go a few up there

2029
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,119
so it was what we call chocolate Thai at

2030
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:08,460
the time and that and and and that's why

2031
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:10,559
I say that to my favorite Haze it it's

2032
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:12,300
just the same as that you know the

2033
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,060
difference is that chocolate Thai that

2034
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:17,579
seed was it was it was predictable you

2035
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:19,500
know like you grow a couple of those

2036
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:21,899
plants you know and they're they were

2037
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,859
all good you know it was it was it was

2038
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:25,559
amazing

2039
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:27,719
wow what a what a brilliant introduction

2040
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,159
growing your own chocolate Thai I bet it

2041
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:33,239
was delightful

2042
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:36,960
yeah it was so what happened from them

2043
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:40,198
did you begin to start growing in LA

2044
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,359
no not really I I started fight I knews

2045
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:45,059
I I happened into somebody was a friend

2046
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:48,738
of the family uh who was selling this

2047
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:52,800
really killer bud in Santa Monica and um

2048
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:55,079

probably 16 actually say I've been

2051
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:59,460
growing the stuff that you've been

2052
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:01,980
buying I got this place in Northern

2053
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:04,198
California you know you want a job

2054
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:06,238
and I said hell hell yeah and that's

2055
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:10,859
that's when I came up here it's a winter

2056
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:13,559
of 86 I think uh my first cup was in 87

2057
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:16,319
so again I've been here ever since

2058
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:18,780
oh my Lord so much to go what like

2059
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:20,819
that's such a cool opportunity when you

2060
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:23,460
got up there with their plants there did

2061
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:26,219
you pick the seeds what were you growing

2062
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,500
oh all the varieties that he had and

2063
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:31,739
everybody else you know around the

2064
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:33,840
neighborhood had uh you know the chemist

2065
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:36,658
was one guy that had a particularly good

2066
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,159
variety of seeds and you know everybody

2067
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:39,839
in the neighborhood back there they

2068
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:42,059
would they would share what they had and

2069
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,159
you know you grew a little bit of

2070
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,500
everything checked stuff out and stuff

2071
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:48,359
and developed your own favorites

2072
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,340
and um

2073
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:51,779
and that's what I did anyway I think

2074
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:54,360
that's what everybody was doing back

2075
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:57,300
then but yeah there was no shortage of

2076
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:59,939
variety you know and lots of that's gone

2077
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,860
by the wayside too and it's it's because

2078
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:03,359
they were you know if they were

2079
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:06,479
somebody's favorite and they didn't save

2080
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,399
him save them well that's on them you

2081
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,379
know you should should be honest with

2082
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,960
yourself about what's your favorite I

2083
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:14,359
also got deep chunk and Haze man that's

2084
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,920
my favorite

2085
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:20,158
if the whole world if the whole world

2086
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:23,399
did that you know uh cannabis would be a

2087
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:25,859
lot better off uh cannabis culture would

2088
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:28,399
be a lot better off uh

2089
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:31,859
you know we have this awesome gene pool

2090
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:34,979
that was incredibly diverse and it had

2091
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:37,079
little pockets of of homozygosity and

2092
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:39,059
and stats you have true breeding lines

2093
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:41,279
that would develop because they were you

2094
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,719
know that's all they had to your

2095
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:44,340
favorites you know that's right that's

2096
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:47,100
what you should be growing you should be

2097
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:49,380
growing what floats your boat and you

2098
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,900
should be doing something about that to

2099
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:54,119
keep it to keep it alive

2100
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:58,139
we'll come back to that topic because it

2101
01:23:54,119 --> 01:24:00,059
is one worth visiting for sure but you

2102
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:02,460
mentioned the chemist I think a lot of

2103
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:04,320
the information online says the chemist

2104
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:07,079
was your father but I think based on

2105
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:10,319
what you just said he wasn't

2106
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:14,158
no he's just a friend and neighbor

2107
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:16,439
um he's in until this day uh he's still

2108
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:18,658
up here he just one of the original guys

2109
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:20,939
that you know that were up here when

2110
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:23,039
people started coming up and and you

2111
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:25,198
know realizing you know that they could

2112
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:28,019
get that they'd get that same price for

2113
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:30,419
that California green Bud up north that

2114
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:32,820
that tie was fetching you know it

2115
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:35,158
started out about 1800 bucks you could

2116
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:37,198
get a pound of Thai or Northern

2117
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:39,420
California sensimilla

2118
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:42,119
um that's that's really what changed

2119
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:43,560
everything into into something that

2120
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:45,658
where people could make the money up

2121
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,460
here before that uh it was just back to

2122
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:49,738
the Landers that were yeah they were

2123
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:51,719
growing some grass but it wasn't really

2124
01:24:49,738 --> 01:24:53,718
for profit it was for you know putting

2125
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:57,480
away over the winter

2126
01:24:53,719 --> 01:25:00,600
wow okay and so what was it like for you

2127
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:02,039
to begin to acquire some of the strains

2128
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:05,340
you're known for because you know

2129
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:06,960
there's the x18 the pine tar how what

2130
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,400
was the journey like to pick some of

2131
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,140
these strains up were they just things

2132
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,658
that went around or did you have to go

2133
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:15,179
out of your way to get them

2134
01:25:12,658 --> 01:25:17,698
well I used to grow with the chemist um

2135
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:19,920
you know we we were Partners on a few

2136
01:25:17,698 --> 01:25:22,379
things and that so I knew all of his

2137
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:25,319
lines really well and I just hit him up

2138
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:27,900
you know hey give me this give me that

2139
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:31,079
um you know and I was already into the

2140
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:33,059
into the science of it at the time which

2141
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:35,219
he and he's a real chemist you know he's

2142
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:36,719
in he's a science in his previous life

2143
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:38,520
you know I think he was making the

2144
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,119
flavor grape or some [Â __Â ] in a lab

2145
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:44,100
somewhere but um but he is a scientist

2146
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:46,079
and kept really really good notes and

2147
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:48,659
and that impressed me

2148
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:51,238
um and and I had a good grasp of

2149
01:25:48,658 --> 01:25:53,399
breeding and that impressed him so he so

2150
01:25:51,238 --> 01:25:54,658
he's been pretty open with his lines but

2151
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:56,219
he you know he's a friend he just

2152
01:25:54,658 --> 01:25:57,719
visited me a couple of weeks ago we had

2153
01:25:56,219 --> 01:26:00,060
dinner

2154
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:01,980
um he's still around he's up in his 70s

2155
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:03,120
now or something but uh he's real

2156
01:26:01,979 --> 01:26:05,279
healthy

2157
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:07,198
oh that's fantastic to hear that you're

2158
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:10,198
still in touch and that he's doing well

2159
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:12,599
that's amazing like I think I might be

2160
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:15,539
wrong here but was it the pine tar Kush

2161
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:18,500
was the x-16

2162
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:23,880
15 I think okay

2163
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:25,439
it's D15 the the chemists recall is you

2164
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:28,139
know other nickname is D and it was

2165
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:32,399
number 15 from the chemist and as in the

2166
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:34,079
18 was to 18. yeah okay and so it sounds

2167
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,539
like there was a number of interesting

2168
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:38,399
strains what was it about the other ones

2169
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:40,380
which made you think they weren't quite

2170
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,779
worth looking into more in the way the

2171
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,819
ones you picked were

2172
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:48,179
well I snagged out snagged the Indian

2173
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:48,899
off of him too which was his number nine

2174
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:52,679
um

2175
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:54,779
and uh these are these are all of my

2176
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:56,219
favorites

2177
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:58,259
um

2178
01:26:56,219 --> 01:26:59,939
he's had a bunch of hybrids and stuff

2179
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:01,800
but I wasn't interested in that these

2180
01:26:59,939 --> 01:27:04,138
ones were the ones that went back back

2181
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,060
to their parentage and they're like

2182
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:08,039
because the hybrids were really nice too

2183
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:10,020
I was like the same thing like when I

2184
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:11,880
went to Holland I want the [Â __Â ]

2185
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,219
parents I'll make my own hybrids thank

2186
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,380
you very much

2187
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:18,359
I love it a man that knows what he wants

2188
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:21,539
okay that makes sense if the other ones

2189
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:24,420
were hybrids interesting okay so in that

2190
01:27:21,539 --> 01:27:26,100
case did he ever tell you where he got

2191
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:29,520
some of those things from

2192
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:33,179
well it does very good yeah I think the

2193
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,739
uh I think the North Indian Indica come

2194
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:36,179
off of bell Springs Road here in

2195
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:38,579
Mendocino County

2196
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:43,619
and then the uh

2197
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:45,539
the uh the ptk and the x-18 come off of

2198
01:27:43,619 --> 01:27:47,639
another grower that's still with us and

2199
01:27:45,539 --> 01:27:49,139
here in the neighborhood too

2200
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:50,760
um same guy that used to grow some

2201
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:52,679
Hawaiian

2202
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,900
um that that he got off of him when he

2203
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:56,639
did some work with him

2204
01:27:54,899 --> 01:27:58,439
um you know back then people used to

2205
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,900
have little projects together and such

2206
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:02,579
and and they would share and then the

2207
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:05,279
neighborhood oh we all know each other

2208
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:06,899
and you know it's like this this stuff

2209
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,698
that I'm smoking today the neighborhood

2210
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:11,819
you know comes over and he wants to show

2211
01:28:08,698 --> 01:28:15,119
off this yeah check this stuff out man

2212
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:16,819
and uh that's where it all starts it was

2213
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:20,519
so you know I mean imagine

2214
01:28:16,819 --> 01:28:22,019
it's the same as now the online [Â __Â ] you

2215
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,460
know I mean a bit of a but a whole

2216
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:25,739
different thing you know before they

2217
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:27,119
were before there was an internet but it

2218
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:28,619
was the same it's always been that same

2219
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:30,840
[Â __Â ] somebody's got something there's

2220
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:32,698
like hey man this is really good you

2221
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,039
know they want to show somebody

2222
01:28:32,698 --> 01:28:37,138
you know yeah that's awesome that it was

2223
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:39,179
sort of like this tight-knit community

2224
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:41,219
of people collaborating together that's

2225
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:42,840
really cool and you mentioned it a few

2226
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:44,939
times so we'll dive down this Rabbit

2227
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:47,159
Hole now the North Indian it's got a

2228
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:49,198
cult following I think mostly because it

2229
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:51,119
never really got released and so people

2230
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:53,819
have always felt like there was this

2231
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,439
Mystique around it I certainly have I've

2232
01:28:53,819 --> 01:28:57,899
seen you talk about it online and I

2233
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:59,698
think you said like oh it's people might

2234
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:01,859
not like it as much as the other lines

2235
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:04,019
how would you describe it and how come

2236
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:07,099
it never really made it to Market in the

2237
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:07,100
way the other lines did

2238
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:13,260
well it's a smaller budded plant it's

2239
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:16,019
one of these ones that have you know

2240
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:17,340
little wrap you know a little pop up all

2241
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:19,199
the way up the stem it doesn't throw

2242
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:21,600
together a cola

2243
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:26,219
um really at all and the beds are kind

2244
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:29,100
of this uniform but smaller uh size

2245
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:33,000
and um and it's not incredibly resonance

2246
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:34,560
you know uh nor nor particularly you

2247
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,439
know incredibly potent

2248
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,960
you know but it had this flavor that

2249
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:42,479
just that just crossed out so [Â __Â ]

2250
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,980
good with everything else that I that I

2251
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,019
got from the chemist and you know I was

2252
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:47,519
growing out the hybrids that that he had

2253
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,540
made you know when I was working with

2254
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,719
him

2255
01:29:48,539 --> 01:29:54,479
um so I knew it was a excellent parental

2256
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:56,399
input and occasionally that thing will

2257
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:59,759
throw out some of that roadkill skunk

2258
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:01,979
you know the super super skunky stuff

2259
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,800
and that and a job said it's not

2260
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:06,479
incredibly potent or resonance but uh

2261
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,760
it's a valuable plant to me I really

2262
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:11,759
like that plant when it's on

2263
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:12,900
and you know it hybridized it costs it

2264
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,179
out real well

2265
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:17,638
I did an open pollination I remember I

2266
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:20,819
was gonna get him out there and and I

2267
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:23,460
got super busy this is really a sad

2268
01:30:20,819 --> 01:30:25,380
story but I'm gonna tell it anyway so I

2269
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:29,698
did this open pollination until until

2270
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:32,400
the actually I think I think CBF was

2271
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:35,939
maybe with me that year because my

2272
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:37,799
friend CBF uh online he I know him in

2273
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:40,259
person and he's a good friend and he

2274
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:42,659
came out and spent a summer with me but

2275
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:45,119
so anyway at this uh that Northern

2276
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:47,519
Indian Indica uh Greenhouse filled with

2277
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:50,158
a hundred plus plants and did this open

2278
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:53,040
pollination and dried dried the seed and

2279
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,719
stuff and I just got you know I got

2280
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,719
super busy with Harvest you know the

2281
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:01,079
things I just chucked it in a uh

2282
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:04,020
in a contractor bag you know uh you know

2283
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:05,939
a big you know black garbage bag and I

2284
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:07,620
and I threw it in the shed you know it

2285
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:09,599
was dry I just kind of put it away I'm

2286
01:31:07,619 --> 01:31:12,960
gonna go I'll deal with this later

2287
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,340
and uh I kind of forgot about it in the

2288
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,139
mid middle of harp you know in the

2289
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:18,480
midship Harvest and the chaos and

2290
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:21,000
everything and when I when I did go

2291
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:23,759
check it out uh mice had gotten into

2292
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,100
this [Â __Â ] bag and they just ripped

2293
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,800
through this and they ate every [Â __Â ]

2294
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:31,079
seed and um and they and they left a

2295
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:34,739
bunch of my [Â __Â ] and it's in his path

2296
01:31:31,079 --> 01:31:37,079
you know so I bet you were all shred you

2297
01:31:34,738 --> 01:31:39,359
know just turned to powder and just a

2298
01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:41,399
pile of my [Â __Â ] kind of thing as they

2299
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,579
ate through the plant and ate up all of

2300
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:46,198
my my precious seed I mean I still have

2301
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:48,300
it you know I could just do another open

2302
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:49,619
pollination and I just saw the cabinets

2303
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:52,500
the other day and let them know I'm

2304
01:31:49,619 --> 01:31:53,819
gonna be raiding a stash and all that

2305
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,460
pretty soon because he's not because

2306
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:59,639
he's not growing anymore you know

2307
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:01,560
um but uh but yeah let's say it was

2308
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,760
brutal it was brutal I just spent you

2309
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:04,860
know months and months and months on

2310
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:07,739
this open pollination I chucked it in

2311
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:09,359
this freaking old shack and uh the mice

2312
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:11,218
had got into it and this and went for

2313
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,019
the feed straight for the seeds you know

2314
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:15,420
and just ate and be you know Berry

2315
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:18,000
reckoned efficiently every [Â __Â ] seed

2316
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:20,460
in this whole and you know this is in a

2317
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,380
you know several pounds of weed you know

2318
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:24,719
probably 10 pounds over 10 pounds of

2319
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:26,699
seeded weed or something yeah this is

2320
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,520
this is a lot of seeded weed you know

2321
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:31,859
over 100 plants in a in a greenhouse

2322
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,420
uh so but yeah so they went through a

2323
01:32:31,859 --> 01:32:35,579
lot and they didn't miss any of them

2324
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:37,560
seed either man I went through that step

2325
01:32:35,579 --> 01:32:40,439
opening up find so at least something

2326
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:42,360
you know underneath the shake that these

2327
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,759
the mice had turned all the seated Bud

2328
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:47,960
into and there was nothing but my [Â __Â ]

2329
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:50,300
but it's a real drag man

2330
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:53,698
oh my God that's absolutely

2331
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:55,980
heartbreaking and I can only imagine how

2332
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:58,439
efficiently they went through it

2333
01:32:55,979 --> 01:32:59,819
so yeah that that's why it never got

2334
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:01,439
released because like that's what

2335
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:04,079
happened you know when I had that in

2336
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:07,138
mind and so it just got eaten and it's

2337
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:09,238
like yeah you know I I you know I'll

2338
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:11,579
still do it for myself but it's not

2339
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:13,079
really high priority to like do it and

2340
01:33:11,579 --> 01:33:15,800
get it all out there and stuff people

2341
01:33:13,079 --> 01:33:18,899
probably won't like it anyway you know

2342
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:21,719
yeah I mean I'm interested to know your

2343
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:23,579
thoughts on why we don't see Indian more

2344
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:26,340
prevalent among users do you think it

2345
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:29,819
just does relate to the yield thing

2346
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:31,980
I don't know I think that uh

2347
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:34,019
you know I think India has certainly

2348
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:35,459
done its fair share of passing some

2349
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:37,199
really good grass around the world

2350
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,880
that's for sure

2351
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:42,299
everywhere from you know probably

2352
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,340
Columbia Jamaica all that uh

2353
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:47,100
I don't know you never know what happens

2354
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:48,600
you know I think that it's probably all

2355
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,840
crap right now that's what I'm

2356
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:53,880
hesitating to say but that's that's kind

2357
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,920
of what I suspect you know same you

2358
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:58,619
could say the same thing about Thai

2359
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:02,819
you know all of these all of these honey

2360
01:33:58,619 --> 01:34:05,760
pots scattered around the world it has a

2361
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:10,738
another factor involved and that's like

2362
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:13,079
you know by time you know uh you can't

2363
01:34:10,738 --> 01:34:14,939
keep something great forever man

2364
01:34:13,079 --> 01:34:16,639
and I think if there was a bunch of

2365
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:19,559
great stuff in in

2366
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:21,300
India right now we we would see Great

2367
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:24,000
India you know I could say the same

2368
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:25,860
thing about Thailand right now

2369
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,840
um you know there's just not a lot of

2370
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:29,698
great stuff there or or I think you

2371
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,480
would see all that stuff I mean I think

2372
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:35,339
it's there somewhere I'm a Believer

2373
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:38,279
but it's hiding inside it's hiding in

2374
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:41,539
somebody's attic you know somewhere old

2375
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:44,819
seeds that Uncle Joe forgot about

2376
01:34:41,539 --> 01:34:46,260
yeah I can completely understand that I

2377
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:48,599
think a lot of people are hoping we find

2378
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:50,039
some gold from that I'd be interested to

2379
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,960
know your thought because you have grown

2380
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:54,960
out a bunch of Indian and a bunch of

2381
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:57,480
haze in your experience do you see any

2382
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,800
Indian in the positronics haze for

2383
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,319
example

2384
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:04,500
oh I probably wouldn't know the

2385
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:07,198
difference between uh you know a a

2386
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:09,840
Mexican or an Indian if I saw it growing

2387
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:13,619
you know certainly some of the uh you

2388
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:15,000
know more tropical Mexicans uh or you

2389
01:35:13,619 --> 01:35:17,579
know which I would probably wouldn't

2390
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:20,399
know the difference between any of the

2391
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:22,198
inputs of uh except for maybe a

2392
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:24,599
Colombian that was purple enough you

2393
01:35:22,198 --> 01:35:27,599
know if any of the inputs but but I

2394
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:30,239
don't doubt uh you know uh

2395
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,920
no doubt that the the Southern India

2396
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,138
Minds you it's not just Indian it's

2397
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,940
South India you know and it's like wow

2398
01:35:34,139 --> 01:35:39,840
that's pretty goddamn specific and and

2399
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:43,559
that was the description that that I was

2400
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:45,960
uh looking at at the time and um and

2401
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:49,020
we've seen Rob Clark write it and he's a

2402
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,819
damn good friend with Sam you know I

2403
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:53,340
don't have any reason to doubt that it's

2404
01:35:50,819 --> 01:35:55,500
exactly what they say it is

2405
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:57,840
it you could you could chase the lineage

2406
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:00,658
back too and and say that it originally

2407
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,639
was a Colombian you know uh they may

2408
01:36:00,658 --> 01:36:06,658
have been selling it already as Haze by

2409
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:09,359
then too and uh but I I bet I I allow

2410
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:11,879
for all of it you know the the uh

2411
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:14,039
description of the the four-way hybrid

2412
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,560
didn't didn't come out of thin air you

2413
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:19,079
know and when guys like Rob Clark have

2414
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:21,000
written it and other people

2415
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:23,880
you know who I think we're probably

2416
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,698
around back then I would call that age

2417
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:29,460
too it's certainly one of the hazes that

2418
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:30,658
was known to Amsterdam and Holland you

2419
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:32,399
know at the time

2420
01:36:30,658 --> 01:36:34,679
uh there's just

2421
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,059
there's too many descriptions from back

2422
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,819
then I was there

2423
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:41,219
you know to uh to change it now

2424
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:43,559
yeah while we're on the topic though I

2425
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:47,100
wanted to touch on are there any other

2426
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:49,560
sort of underrated land race or genetic

2427
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:51,600
hot spots in your opinion and I guess to

2428
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,980
me India is sort of one that comes to

2429
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,380
mind that you know you don't hear about

2430
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:56,879
it quite as much are there any others in

2431
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:58,920
your mind that you think are a bit like

2432
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,800
that

2433
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:05,100
oh yeah well certainly southeast Asia

2434
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:08,579
right I mean that's probably the the

2435
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:11,360
biggest one and out in our life you know

2436
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:14,939
that cranked out more quality uh I think

2437
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:18,000
than any other place uh when you talk

2438
01:37:14,939 --> 01:37:19,859
about India uh boy that's it's going

2439
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,899
back hundreds and hundreds of years that

2440
01:37:19,859 --> 01:37:23,339
place has been you know putting out

2441
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:25,559
quality

2442
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:29,159
but I don't I don't see it probably

2443
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,679
doing it till you know too much today

2444
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:34,799
I don't know what I would call hot today

2445
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:37,380
as far as land race varieties I think

2446
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:39,659
you know that's a real tough one I I you

2447
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,340
know I would say southeast Asia I think

2448
01:37:39,658 --> 01:37:43,319
there's still probably some you know

2449
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:46,800
even in Thailand and bordering countries

2450
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:49,738
and and neighboring Islands you know uh

2451
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,440
you know all through that that region

2452
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:54,059
um that's still holding gold

2453
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:56,219
um there might be some good [Â __Â ] in

2454
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:57,840
Australia you guys have smoked some of

2455
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:58,679
your fair share of some good Thai Bud

2456
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,380
too

2457
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:04,560
I know that's I know that's true

2458
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:06,420
yes most certainly I believe uh at the

2459
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,520
time yeah Australia was privy to some

2460
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:10,380
nice import from Thailand I'm very

2461
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:13,020
jealous of all those who got to try it

2462
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:15,319
no so you don't get it anymore yeah we

2463
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:18,719
don't either yeah it's a bummer

2464
01:38:15,319 --> 01:38:20,579
unfortunately not no are there any spots

2465
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,800
that you think like really don't get

2466
01:38:20,579 --> 01:38:25,738
enough attention for what they Merit

2467
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,020
like for me I always think like Korea

2468
01:38:25,738 --> 01:38:30,000
never really gets discussed much but I

2469
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:32,219
hear from some Old-Timers that like land

2470
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,899
race Korean was really nice anything

2471
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:36,060
like that for you

2472
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:38,879
I've grown one I've grown in Northern

2473
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:41,580
Korean and uh broadly here that was

2474
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,920
going around the neighborhood uh back in

2475
01:38:41,579 --> 01:38:46,859
the mid 80s or so you know late 80s or

2476
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:50,340
something and and it was a

2477
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:51,719
it was a very unique and flavor God I

2478
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:53,880
don't even remember I just remember it

2479
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:56,639
really stood out in flavor

2480
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:58,560
but you know it it didn't come it wasn't

2481
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:01,560
as good as a deep tone so I let it go

2482
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:04,199
wasn't my favorite but it was super

2483
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:07,199
interesting you know weird spicy

2484
01:39:04,198 --> 01:39:09,539
incensey kind of evil uh thing going on

2485
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:12,539
too it probably would have been a great

2486
01:39:09,539 --> 01:39:14,579
thing to have today for uh for working

2487
01:39:12,539 --> 01:39:17,340
in in High Bridge

2488
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:19,439
yeah look I saved the best for last for

2489
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:22,679
this reason tell us a little bit about

2490
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:24,719
how you came to acquire the Deep chunk I

2491
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:26,219
think one of the memorable stories I've

2492
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:28,139
read online though I have some

2493
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:30,539
suspicions about its authenticity is

2494
01:39:28,139 --> 01:39:33,840
that uh the seeds came out of a brick of

2495
01:39:30,539 --> 01:39:37,738
hash how did it actually go down

2496
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:41,100
no it was It was a itch it was in a

2497
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:43,738
pound of seeded weed that sold for like

2498
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:46,500
you know sold for like five thousand

2499
01:39:43,738 --> 01:39:49,319
dollars a pound when when when when

2500
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:52,679
pounds were eighteen hundred

2501
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:54,960
um it was it was one that you know these

2502
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:58,560
Growers accidentally cheated their crop

2503
01:39:54,960 --> 01:40:03,000
but it was so early and everybody was

2504
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:04,800
just getting exposed to to uh

2505
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,600
um to broadleafs up here you know they

2506
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,480
were all growing early Mexicans up here

2507
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:11,219
before you know the the broadly before

2508
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:12,658
the Afghan and everything else started

2509
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:16,679
coming through when everybody started

2510
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:19,138
rolling in here up to grow uh and it and

2511
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:21,719
so yeah it was a pound of it was a pound

2512
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:24,239
of cheated weed the guy actually got

2513
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:26,880
very entrepreneurial he cheated his crop

2514
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:28,738
instead of saying oh [Â __Â ] you know he

2515
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,199
went and sold the seeded weed for like

2516
01:40:28,738 --> 01:40:34,198
way more than he could have got for per

2517
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:36,419
seedless wheat at the time

2518
01:40:34,198 --> 01:40:39,719
um and somebody and it was super unique

2519
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:42,239
you know and it was and it was like new

2520
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:45,359
and exciting and and this and somebody

2521
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:48,419
up here bought a pound of uh of seated

2522
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:50,819
yeah that Afghan for five thousand

2523
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:52,619
dollars and um and that's how it got

2524
01:40:50,819 --> 01:40:55,738
introduced to the neighborhood

2525
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:57,238
and it's uh flooded around in a few

2526
01:40:55,738 --> 01:40:58,500
people's hands

2527
01:40:57,238 --> 01:41:00,839
um back then

2528
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,800
uh I got a hold of it and I just held on

2529
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,539
tight

2530
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,920
and about you know most other people

2531
01:41:03,539 --> 01:41:06,600
have lost it there might be a couple

2532
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,239
people that still have it from the old

2533
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:11,280
days

2534
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:13,079
yeah wow interesting and what was your

2535
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,420
thoughts when you first grew it out were

2536
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:17,760
you like wow this is something else

2537
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:20,158
all right yeah it really it really stood

2538
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,659
out you know you know to to pretty much

2539
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,479
everybody that sees it for the first

2540
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:27,000
time they're like what the [Â __Â ] is this

2541
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:29,218
you know because it's so it's like

2542
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,010
cartoon-like and it's in its

2543
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:32,000
jurassicness

2544
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:34,739
[Laughter]

2545
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,079
it looks like looks like something out

2546
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:40,979
of it from a different world you know

2547
01:41:37,079 --> 01:41:42,840
yeah it truly is something very unique I

2548
01:41:40,979 --> 01:41:44,698
think another one of the famous sort of

2549
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,679
anecdotes that goes around online is

2550
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:49,079
that some people have noticed that

2551
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:50,819
there's a slightly thinner leafed Fino

2552
01:41:49,079 --> 01:41:52,859
that sort of Pops its head I mean it

2553
01:41:50,819 --> 01:41:55,019
tends to be a very a slightly more

2554
01:41:52,859 --> 01:41:57,000
cerebral sort of high have you ever

2555
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,800
experienced that the thin Leaf deep

2556
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,479
chunk obviously it's still not thin by

2557
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,520
like equatorial standards but the

2558
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:04,618
thinner Leaf deep chunk Fino

2559
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:06,360
yeah I've always kept an eye on them I

2560
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:09,238
like that I like those

2561
01:42:06,359 --> 01:42:11,099
um uh because I I think that they have

2562
01:42:09,238 --> 01:42:13,559
they have more room for cranking out

2563
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:15,679
resin and I've come across a lot of

2564
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,940
really really really good ones like that

2565
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:21,539
uh in my day

2566
01:42:17,939 --> 01:42:22,138
and it you know a narrower Leaf

2567
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:25,380
um

2568
01:42:22,139 --> 01:42:28,020
I can say it might core might might

2569
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:30,600
correlate with uh

2570
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:33,719
you know a higher College delete ratio

2571
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:36,179
you know so I think they're I think

2572
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:37,859
they're worth keeping an eye on

2573
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:39,779
um I'm not trying to grow a bunch of

2574
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:41,639
leafy [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] you know I'm

2575
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:42,960
trying to grow the best resin that I can

2576
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:45,480
with that plant

2577
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:49,920
and um the ones that come out the best

2578
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:51,118
flower you know uh are often a thinner

2579
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,920
leaf

2580
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:55,698
interesting interesting and have you

2581
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:58,260
ever had any ideas or thoughts about

2582
01:42:55,698 --> 01:42:59,939
where the Deep chunk comes from like

2583
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:03,300
specifically

2584
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:04,138
I I was you know in Afghanistan I know

2585
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:06,000
that

2586
01:43:04,139 --> 01:43:08,159
there was a million of them around here

2587
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,039
you know at the time

2588
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,059
but it was one of the more extreme ones

2589
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,340
you know

2590
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:17,340
and I and I and I thought I found it

2591
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:19,319
really cerebral too and so I kept it

2592
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:20,880
and pretty consistent you know I mean

2593
01:43:19,319 --> 01:43:22,500
and and you know it could like I said

2594
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,840
before earlier it could do really well

2595
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:26,880
in the shade you know those [Â __Â ]

2596
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:29,460
leaves are great solar panels

2597
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:31,618
yeah amazing I mean out of curiosity

2598
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:33,420
were there ever any other things that

2599
01:43:31,618 --> 01:43:36,359
went around back in the day like sort of

2600
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:38,940
around that time that were maybe unique

2601
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:42,299
in a sense or memorable for some reason

2602
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:44,759
the hundreds hundreds you know so it's

2603
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:47,460
hard to even talk about them but except

2604
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:49,500
to say that I cry myself my to sleep at

2605
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,539
night for you know [Â __Â ] up and not

2606
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:54,179
keeping more of it you know even though

2607
01:43:51,539 --> 01:43:56,340
it wasn't my favorite but I'm happy that

2608
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:58,500
I've kept my you know what was my

2609
01:43:56,340 --> 01:44:00,440
favorite you know so I kind of feel like

2610
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:03,300
you know I'm off the hook

2611
01:44:00,439 --> 01:44:04,979
yes trust me I'm gonna give you the old

2612
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:07,139
clue we're very grateful for what you've

2613
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:09,718
given us so I mean while we're on the

2614
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:13,079
topic we had a gypsy Nirvana on not long

2615
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,460
ago and he he told me that um you had

2616
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:17,039
this interesting story about like

2617
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:18,539
winning the Cannabis Cup with deep chunk

2618
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:21,779
do you remember that

2619
01:44:18,539 --> 01:44:23,880
now I just remember that you know he was

2620
01:44:21,779 --> 01:44:27,000
the first guy that kind of jumped away

2621
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:29,699
from you know the politics of the you

2622
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:32,340
know the whole politics of the uh

2623
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:35,039
Cannabis Cup there

2624
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:38,100
um you know the high times one

2625
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:41,100
uh people were paying to paying to enter

2626
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:43,739
paying to win and it's kind of a

2627
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:45,659
kind of a Shifty scenario and you and he

2628
01:44:43,738 --> 01:44:48,539
just you know he wanted to

2629
01:44:45,658 --> 01:44:50,879
you know make it more of a you know

2630
01:44:48,539 --> 01:44:54,238
anybody can anybody can come over here

2631
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:56,340
and and enter the contest you know I

2632
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:58,979
think I sent him a couple ounces

2633
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:01,520
and um and I've won the [Â __Â ] I

2634
01:44:58,979 --> 01:45:04,379
couldn't believe it pretty funny

2635
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:06,420
there you go that's incredible I mean

2636
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:08,400
they probably never had anything even

2637
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:10,800
similar remotely

2638
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:12,118
I don't know uh There Was You know I

2639
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,980
mean I think I think there was already

2640
01:45:12,118 --> 01:45:16,019
Diesel and stuff by the time by that

2641
01:45:13,979 --> 01:45:18,599
time out you know available I think it

2642
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:19,800
was there it was I think it was 04 or

2643
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,179
something like that

2644
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,880
you know there was some there was

2645
01:45:21,179 --> 01:45:26,219
probably some good smoke there

2646
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,739
um but I I had just done an outdoor grow

2647
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:30,658
of like 50 plants and

2648
01:45:28,738 --> 01:45:32,698
and I had a couple of ones that I was

2649
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:35,460
keeping an eye on you know because they

2650
01:45:32,698 --> 01:45:36,899
were like [Â __Â ] resin bombs halfway

2651
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:39,179
through flower

2652
01:45:36,899 --> 01:45:41,638
and I think you know I had a few of them

2653
01:45:39,179 --> 01:45:44,340
tagged I was keeping an eye on and I

2654
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:45,420
grabbed the best two of 50 and sent them

2655
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:48,119
in

2656
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:49,319
wow okay yeah so some nice ones by the

2657
01:45:48,118 --> 01:45:52,319
sounds of it

2658
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:53,719
yeah yeah pretty well apparently so they

2659
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:56,960
were my favorites

2660
01:45:53,719 --> 01:46:00,480
that's why I used to set them in

2661
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:02,819
and you know and uh

2662
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:03,959
it hurts a little because there's you

2663
01:46:02,819 --> 01:46:06,000
know those are the ones that you want

2664
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:09,739
all of that weed yeah you gotta here now

2665
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,738
I gotta send this guy an ounce you know

2666
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:17,639
but I did and I don't regret it I guess

2667
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:19,800
uh that's funny I like that he uh he

2668
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:22,139
spoke pretty fondly of his Recollections

2669
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:24,600
of you and he said that like uh

2670
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:26,579
initially before he was like stocking

2671
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,500
your seeds you you were just sending

2672
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:30,899
them to him is that true that sounds

2673
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:32,639
very interesting yeah well you know I

2674
01:46:30,899 --> 01:46:34,738
mean that's

2675
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,880
it's kind of been what it's all about uh

2676
01:46:34,738 --> 01:46:36,479
you know

2677
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,719
um

2678
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:41,698
I don't uh I did I didn't want to handle

2679
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:44,039
I don't really didn't want to handle all

2680
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:45,899
the PMs and all that stuff you know so I

2681
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:47,698
figured I'd just give him the Gypsy you

2682
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:50,638
can [Â __Â ] give him out because he was

2683
01:46:47,698 --> 01:46:52,198
doing freebies at the time you know I'm

2684
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,300
like okay well you know he can do

2685
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:56,339
something like that with these and that

2686
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:59,420
