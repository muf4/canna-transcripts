let's get back into it guys

57
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,080
I notice you you work with seed banks

58
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,119
but you also sell via your own site and

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,280
I've seen that this is becoming a more

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,259
increasingly popular option for a lot of

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,878
breeders and I'm sort of wondering do

62
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,280
you think we're moving to like a direct

63
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,560
sales model eventually with breeder and

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,199
customer or do you think seabanks will

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,140
always be sort of the mainstay

66
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,818
I think that um I don't know I hate to

67
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:13,679
say it but I think eventually it's going

68
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:16,738
to be an all-legal model

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,500
it just it'll be uh at some point it'll

70
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,378
be a lot easier to get uh you know get

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,239
into the system and create legal seeds I

72
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,518
mean it's already there like you can do

73
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,680
you can create legal seeds in Canada you

74
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,300
just gotta go through and get a

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,180
you know you have to have a little bit

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,599
of money to invest I think uh yeah at

77
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,580
some point it's going to be more like

78
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,919
um garden seeds or whatever

79
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,599
weed won't be valuable to grow it'll be

80
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,000
like a tomato you know when we get to

81
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,119
that spot when everything is [ __ ]

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,580
have fiber and my hemp bricks everywhere

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,920
and weed plants everywhere and you know

84
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,719
it'll be like a tomato or a strawberry

85
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,280
or anything else yeah it's just gonna be

86
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,979
like think of how

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,959
there's so many um there's been so many

88
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,238
new breeders in the last 10 years like

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,500
it's just exploded like the amount of

90
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,280
breeders

91
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,199
um and you know there's only only um you

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,780
know you only need so many

93
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,198
uh like there's only so the Market's

94
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,339
only buying so many seeds

95
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,720
I don't know I think at some point it's

96
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,339
just

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,380
it's just going to be all legal because

98
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,758
it'll just be the path of least

99
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,860
resistance

100
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,540
um there really is no

101
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,400
you know most countries there's not a

102
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,500
way to sell seeds legally but in Canada

103
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,258
there is and I can see how

104
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,699
uh in the future that'll just be uh the

105
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,439
model for everywhere

106
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,360
like they'll be

107
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,180
I think I know most places now most

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,340
countries now they're um that are

109
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,300
legalizing or whatever have a med

110
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,000
program

111
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,939
um there's a way for to get cannabis

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,740
into the legal seed registration program

113
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,259
like there's a

114
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,620
I think it's like United Nations seed

115
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:01,500
program in every country in in the world

116
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,660
has their version of it

117
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,139
um and they just have to put cannabis in

118
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,340
there more or less but then

119
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,199
um

120
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,939
like there's all sorts of complications

121
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,900
with politics from what I understand

122
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:17,639
like uh uh you can't uh

123
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,719
like right now you can't really export

124
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,519
stuff around the world because

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,259
everyone's got quotas

126
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,918
for like in the recreational side of

127
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,960
things like the UN won't allow

128
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,719
a recreational expert but there's

129
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,399
medical export and eventually I think

130
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,020
eventually there's just going to be like

131
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,899
everything's going to be open at some

132
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,758
point but we're just like going through

133
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:42,918
Growing Pains correct well growing pains

134
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,919
are really extreme Growing Pains

135
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,879
and do you think you'll be able to

136
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,939
continue your operation in approximately

137
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,100
the same sort of way it is now going

138
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,079
forward with legalization or do you sort

139
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,840
of fear the big AG moving in type of

140
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,939
thing uh well what's happening is like

141
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,439
we were talking about pink Kush the end

142
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,060
of pink Kush the end of the like

143
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,160
Kingfisher

144
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,280
um these guys when they hit the wall the

145
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,539
pink Kush is not selling anymore well a

146
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,939
lot of them are saying well what do I

147
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:14,159
got to do to become to get a legal

148
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:17,100
commercial license and like it happened

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,939
a decade ago in the medical side of

150
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,979
things

151
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,918
um all sorts of guys were you know

152
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:26,219
growing Black Market had no intention of

153
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,019
joining the the system and getting a

154
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,940
like a medical license because at that

155
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,560
time it was like at the at the very

156
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,959
beginning you could only get it you know

157
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,978
it was hard to get it more than a few

158
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,818
plants

159
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,639
um

160
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,280
uh like a license license yeah yeah

161
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,000
there's the licenses were by basically

162
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,339
by plant count so but like over the past

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,959
10 years that is like things have

164
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,638
loosened up and docked you know there's

165
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,279
like these

166
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,439
uh like gray area kind of doctors that

167
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,059
are or even like nurses Nurse

168
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,360
Practitioners that you know they

169
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,680
understand how the law works and how we

170
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,699
have to do to

171
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,160
to

172
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,360
um get licenses for like a bunch of

173
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,580
people

174
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,439
um with you know

175
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,079
like

176
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,139
like a much higher plan counts than what

177
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,399
was previously possible

178
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,840
um

179
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,698
so

180
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,538
anyways like the

181
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,538
the whole like

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,120
um

183
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,318
pinkish thing exploded these guys need

184
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,859
to uh figure out

185
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,400
like they they were hesitant back in the

186
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,500
medical days they were hesitant about

187
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,120
getting licensed through the government

188
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,759
um but eventually everyone did

189
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,439
eventually there's like no even the

190
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,479
holdouts they were like I'm never gonna

191
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,279
do it yeah yeah they're like they all

192
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,038
got their lunch the hardest the hardest

193
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,779
uh these Old-Timers that would like they

194
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,379
would you know like the most

195
00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:00,299
uh anti-uh like establishment guys like

196
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,680
they all went and got uh licenses

197
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,620
because

198
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,620
it's like uh um in California when they

199
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,418
had the you know their medical program

200
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,720
um they just the doctors figured out how

201
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,680
you know how to

202
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,720
disseminate a whole bunch of licenses

203
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,579
and get a bunch of money for it it's the

204
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,199
same deal here so if there's money to be

205
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,699
made

206
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
um you know you can sell out you know

207
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,098
get a bunch of licenses

208
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,919
um

209
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,439
to people and uh

210
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,719
like it was you know it all comes down

211
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,399
to like how easy like how much of a pain

212
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,800
in the ass is it you got a license

213
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,839
basically and they've just made it like

214
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,639
really easy to get a license though so

215
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,039
there's really no reason not to get a

216
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,319
license uh

217
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,360
but uh

218
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,360
like in the future I think that it's

219
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,980
going to be the same way for commercial

220
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,259
uh micro like commercial cannabis

221
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,700
licenses in Canada

222
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,439
um it'll just be

223
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,019
like they've we've already seen it in

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,019
the past uh the program started in

225
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,459
2013

226
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,760
our legal uh Recreation like our legal

227
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:10,879
like uh

228
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,919
no no no no no yeah it was MMA

229
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:17,278
originally yeah or like it was basically

230
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,259
our legal commercial framework started

231
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,600
in 2013.

232
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,480
and uh like initially those first guys

233
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,278
that that got into the system

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,879
um like there's a bunch of big guys that

235
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:32,338
gone into the system initially and then

236
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,320
um like a bunch of those early guys that

237
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,820
got into the system had no idea or they

238
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,260
were trying to get into the system they

239
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,300
had no idea what the hell you know like

240
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,519
what they needed to do because they like

241
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,379
everything was kind of like big

242
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,700
like they had um you know it was just a

243
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,700
new system it was hard to get

244
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,278
information yeah yeah like the

245
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,660
um there's a lot of like money that was

246
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,000
wasted

247
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,579
um and it was just costing millions and

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,940
millions of dollars

249
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,940
um but now like nowadays for fifteen

250
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,620
thousand dollars uh

251
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,480
for like fifteen thousand dollars

252
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,580
basically you needed to have at least

253
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,399
fifteen thousand dollars

254
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,100
for one year uh to get your like micro

255
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,100
cultivation license

256
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,899
um and and a facility that's like up to

257
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,019
spec but the

258
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:26,278
for the micro guys the um

259
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:28,320
requirements are a lot more relaxed so

260
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,778
uh like it took a while to get these

261
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,580
micro licenses as part of the Canadian

262
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:34,679
system but you know

263
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,700
now that they've introduced them and now

264
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,639
that they're

265
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,160
um like pumping out the licenses um

266
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,620
it's a lot easier like

267
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,899
there's and you can there's guys selling

268
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,200
like out application

269
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,740
uh like an application uh template

270
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,740
basically

271
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,299
um you just like fill in your your stuff

272
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,339
and uh go get your license

273
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,859
they're pumping out uh four to eight

274
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,839
licenses a week that's like standard and

275
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:08,220
micro cultivation in Canada so there's

276
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:11,519
like 800 or some licensees right now

277
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,259
um so yeah eventually like I can see

278
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,700
but I mean it's going to be the same

279
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,958
thing like

280
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,940
is I don't know there's only so much

281
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,319
weed that can be grown and sold like

282
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,560
within our market and we can't do

283
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,500
recreational market account right now

284
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,479
they can't export any of it

285
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,139
they can only export

286
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:38,039
medical uh stuff and it generally has to

287
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:41,039
be like EU compliant

288
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,599
because a lot of it's going to uh Europe

289
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,980
and then there's some going to uh

290
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,220
Australia

291
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,259
yeah yes there are definitely a few

292
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,959
Australians who have been the uh the

293
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,939
beneficiaries of the Canadian system but

294
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,379
I think nowadays uh there's there's

295
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,060
quite a few facilities online in

296
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,838
Australia so there's some options out

297
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,199
there

298
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:05,339
I did want to take a moment to jump over

299
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,680
to the legendary Roberts Creek Congo

300
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,079
a lot of questions relating to this one

301
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,479
I believe it originated from one of your

302
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,099
good buddies Vision creator

303
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,019
and he's pretty tight with you guys

304
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,778
would you be able to give us a bit of a

305
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,399
back story on it yeah I'll start off the

306
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,860
story um

307
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,458
when I was working with reefer men

308
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,620
when we were in Amsterdam we were um

309
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:31,679
hanging out with uh

310
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:35,578
uh doobie and uh kaiki from kind of

311
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,399
bioin and uh and uh AC

312
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:40,439
um and um

313
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,720
we had like we had established uh like a

314
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,300
bit of a you know friendship there

315
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,480
previous to that and uh we just uh

316
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:51,000
decided to trade some seeds and uh

317
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,879
when we got back to Canada they sent uh

318
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,220
some seeds and uh the Congo was one of

319
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,620
the varieties and um

320
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,240
reefer Man passed it along to Vision

321
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,120
Creator and

322
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,100
uh scabby was actually working with

323
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,560
vision Creator at the time so they

324
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,079
started those seeds

325
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:13,319
and uh yeah we were like doing big

326
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,939
outdoor girls at the time doing like two

327
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,680
three thousand plants at a time and

328
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,959
grabbing all kinds of genetics and just

329
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,458
going through Bam Bam Bam the whole

330
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,319
basement was filled with different

331
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,879
fennels and I'd wake up every day and

332
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,920
like grab a different menu or something

333
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,259
to try it was really fun time

334
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,799
but that Congo plant the game it was one

335
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:33,659
of the best in that year with um

336
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,819
uh the Trinity cut was something that

337
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:38,219
really reminded me of like in the same

338
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,560
kind of Realm like we did them the same

339
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,360
year and they were like back and back

340
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,059
like that right

341
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,000
yeah and uh the rest was history I guess

342
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,399
uh Robbie has uh spread the word of the

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,740
Congo and it I mean it's a really good

344
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,860
plant to grow it's easy to grow it's got

345
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,039
a pretty wicked uh beginner sativa High

346
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,440
I like to call it and uh you know people

347
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,139
like that lemon boot policy it's sexy

348
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,760
people like that and uh yeah it's a good

349
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,959
plan I think more people should grow it

350
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,620
definitely

351
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:13,679
yes it you know what I'll be honest I

352
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,278
actually wasn't familiar with it until I

353
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,559
was at a good good friend of the show Mr

354
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,019
Bob Hemphill I was at his house and he

355
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,899
pulled out a jar and and he only really

356
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,539
has good weed so to speak you know like

357
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,860
really cool old school stuff and I was

358
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:31,199
like what's this he's like oh it's the

359
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,959
Congo man like it's it's the real deal

360
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,660
and um I remember being very impressed

361
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:39,899
by the bud structure very very bulky and

362
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,458
he said to me that like he had heard

363
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,458
rumors it might have been crossed with

364
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:47,039
in Afghani or some sort of Indica well

365
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:49,018
we we uh we submitted that one to philos

366
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,879
and it didn't link up with anything so

367
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,399
kind of like and when you grow it out

368
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,320
and you grow the crosses you see you're

369
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,179
like you see what's in something like

370
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,740
you know you can tell if it's been

371
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,419
crossed with enough yeah we've probably

372
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,419
we've crossed it with so many things

373
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,578
like so many sativas like that if you

374
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,620
know if we grew up a bunch of them you'd

375
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:09,778
think we'd hit something like that but

376
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,940
we've never never yeah and like all the

377
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,159
seeds we put out there with uh Congo

378
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,139
sativa crosses like we never get anyone

379
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,299
coming back saying hey this is the

380
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,039
shorts

381
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:22,859
well sure so you think like it's just

382
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,419
really truly like a a special fast

383
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,919
flowering and the structure just it's

384
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:27,838
like you know just really One of a Kind

385
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,179
well like after growing a lot of

386
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,279
Africans it's in that time frame you

387
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,739
know it's like really really high on the

388
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,078
terpene which is different you know like

389
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,480
the terpene right but you know I'm sure

390
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,219
there's [ __ ] everything out so what

391
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,339
were what were the um

392
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,639
the uh siblings of that like

393
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,459
oh God I can't even remember honestly

394
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,919
was there like really really crazy MP

395
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:55,259
Thanos oh yeah yeah yeah definitely

396
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,740
there were there were some minnows that

397
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:02,338
were uh very uh Medusa headed and spread

398
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,560
out for sure yeah and like uh stuff with

399
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,639
running calyx's anything like that yep

400
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,879
definitely

401
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,159
but the like the the high-end terpene

402
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:14,220
content of that plant is what makes it

403
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,879
really special definitely

404
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,660
and why do you think it's like got this

405
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:23,278
real cult following but hasn't quite

406
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:25,259
truly broke through to the mainstream

407
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,539
quite yet because I remember when I

408
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,578
tried it I was like this is some of the

409
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:32,399
best weed I've ever smoked

410
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,019
um but yet I myself hadn't heard of it

411
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,879
like 10 minutes prior to that you know

412
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,379
and I I was a bit like you know I'm I I

413
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,120
know a lot of strains you know what I

414
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,559
mean like it really makes me feel a bit

415
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,299
caught out

416
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,799
um why do you think it's not more well

417
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,319
known

418
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,958
I think it's got its own special Enigma

419
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,440
like it it decides where it wants to go

420
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,879
and uh who wants to grow it and uh

421
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,680
people that aren't supposed to be

422
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,480
growing up maybe they lose their plants

423
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,159
or something I don't know like

424
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,440
we've been sending cuts down to the

425
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,759
States for years and it should be all

426
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,420
over the place

427
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,699
um

428
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:07,318
but you know one thing I figured out

429
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,900
about Canada over the years because

430
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,459
we've had this uh you know more of a

431
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,640
protective environment or more of a

432
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:17,640
tolerant environment like in the past

433
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,100
um and and because uh everyone like it's

434
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,459
more about indoor a dominated Society

435
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,379
we've just got it's more conducive to

436
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,240
saving cuttings because there's

437
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,360
everyone's pretty much everyone's got a

438
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,400
room or like a light going year-round

439
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,439
you know or during you know at all times

440
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,980
when it's needed

441
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,640
so I think it's just uh it's easier for

442
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,798
uh cuts to circulate in Canada

443
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,840
like I think there may be in the states

444
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,279
uh you know it's more there'll be more

445
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,599
outdoor Growers

446
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,418
um

447
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,418
it just seems like uh

448
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,160
there's just more Cuts being held

449
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:58,020
or just like you know for the amount of

450
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,100
people what we have here you know our

451
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,798
populations

452
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,480
10 of the states

453
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,038
um I think we have a high proportion of

454
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,200
you know people holding Cuts just

455
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,640
because they can you know you got a spot

456
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,380
to hold them

457
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,840
uh there's less Cuts being lost

458
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,200
basically what I'm trying to say

459
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:20,159
yeah nice and out of curiosity have you

460
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,019
guys ever uh grown out any like s1s of

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,380
it and sort of seen what that had inside

462
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,379
it

463
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,798
um no but that's like a dream that's

464
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,779
like right here in front of us right now

465
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,279
at this moment in time so we'll get

466
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,859
there soon

467
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,960
oh you're doing FM right now

468
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:39,839
I'm just um

469
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm just uh starting to uh experiment

470
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,459
with some uh

471
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,140
some feminization like I'm

472
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,819
I did some feminine I've done some

473
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,559
feminization in the past and I just

474
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,558
don't like the

475
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,720
the chemistry of silver thiosulfate

476
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,660
because it's got a bunch of sodium in

477
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,460
the mix like the actual uh chemistry

478
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,580
e-mix

479
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,819
um sodium thiosulfate and silver uh

480
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:08,759
silver nitrate and the molecules swap so

481
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:10,259
you have silver thiosulfate but also in

482
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,240
the same solution you have sodium

483
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:14,339
nitrate

484
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,759
so every time you're spraying your

485
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:20,339
plants with it's not like I'm not

486
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,379
um I'm not trying to like be critical of

487
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,279
it it's just for me like

488
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,740
um

489
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,619
I'm into I'm interested in chemistry so

490
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,779
I want to try uh

491
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:33,538
I just want to try some other

492
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:36,119
um alternate formulations like I've

493
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,220
tried um I just tried um instead of

494
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,859
sodium thiosulfate I thought to myself

495
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,839
well let's try calcium thiosulfate

496
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:45,719
and so we made um

497
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,418
silver thiosulfate and then the other

498
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,038
molecule is calcium nitrate that it

499
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,559
makes in the same solution because

500
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:55,679
you're like when you make sodium when

501
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,599
you make a silver thiosulfate it's a

502
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,179
cool it's like a co-solution there's

503
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,038
like two solutions going on in there

504
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,000
like you don't separate out the sodium

505
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:04,319
nitrate

506
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,079
so

507
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,759
and just I'm just wondering um in my

508
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,399
mind I'm just curious you know maybe we

509
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,140
can maybe there's uh because like from

510
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,419
what I understand like I don't have a

511
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,480
lot of experience with the reversals but

512
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,500
I did enough just to like to know how it

513
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,679
works

514
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,679
but yeah in my mind like

515
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,559
um I want I just want to try uh a bunch

516
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,960
of different other silver molecules

517
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:34,200
because uh like the

518
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,200
the basic theory is

519
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,580
um that you're trying to get as much

520
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,558
you're trying to get a bunch of silver

521
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:42,659
loaded into the plant and when you get

522
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,759
re when you reach a critical

523
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,798
uh amount of silver that's when the

524
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,440
plant starts uh like the hormones start

525
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,079
flipping and they start producing uh

526
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,940
hormones or you know to make male

527
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,279
flowers

528
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,019
um so yeah I'm trying a bunch of

529
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,058
different uh

530
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,720
silver formulations

531
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:05,220
uh I just made made silver citrate so I

532
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,038
took silver nitrate

533
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,600
converted it into silver oxide with uh

534
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:12,179
like a

535
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,119
with lye sodium hydroxide

536
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:19,860
and then mix that with uh citric acid

537
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,779
and then it made uh uh silver citrate in

538
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:24,599
solution

539
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,940
um so I'm you know I'm just gonna try

540
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,678
making a bunch of these molecules and uh

541
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,880
I think the um

542
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:34,980
the first one I tried this silver

543
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,200
thiosulfate calcium nitrate solution

544
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,140
uh worked out pretty good but it's uh

545
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,960
calcium nitrate is a double it's a

546
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,538
double vegging nutrient so calcium is a

547
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,279
veg nutrient and nitrate is a veg

548
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:49,200
nutrient

549
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,399
um so it's like hitting a flowering

550
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,980
plant

551
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,440
with a double veg nutrient is not really

552
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,140
helping it want to flower

553
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,538
so I want like I'm gonna try this uh

554
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,340
silver citrate next just I'm just going

555
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:03,900
to try it just to see what it does

556
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:05,639
um and then I'll just spray the other

557
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,280
stuff as well

558
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,520
um just to compare the reactions

559
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:14,579
are there any specific concerns about

560
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,619
using a standard STS solution that you

561
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,480
hope to overcome by using this

562
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:23,399
alternative one

563
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:26,460
well the in my mind my concern is uh by

564
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,679
spraying the plant with silver sodium

565
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,720
the plant does not want to take up

566
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,860
sodium so maybe it's going to be like

567
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,659
not

568
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:36,418
you know it's not fully going to be able

569
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,640
to upload that silver

570
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,799
um okay and it's also like it's just not

571
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,440
healthy you know if we have the option

572
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,058
of not spraying sodium onto the plant

573
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,700
and we you know can we choose that

574
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:49,980
option is that possible that sounds

575
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,779
pretty reasonable we I actually had a

576
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,640
discussion with a friend of mine the

577
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,960
other day and we were linking some

578
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,580
papers to each other and there's there's

579
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,120
actually a few different chemicals you

580
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:02,939
can use you can also use a cobalt

581
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:05,579
chloride solution yeah that's all true

582
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,259
yeah if you're okay with chloride if

583
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,599
you're okay with um Cobalt and chloride

584
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:13,500
there's also another molecule it's like

585
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,000
three methyl heptinone or something yeah

586
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,099
yeah I know I know which ones are you

587
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,079
talking about those ones are um

588
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,980
yeah I'm not interested in that other

589
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,199
stuff

590
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,659
oh what what about just just straight

591
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,880
out colloidal silver

592
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,419
yeah I don't know like I I've heard that

593
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,460
that's not super reliable yeah I think

594
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,740
it's lesser less effective you've got to

595
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,500
spray it more often and for longer yeah

596
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:41,099
you got to spray it a lot so the other

597
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:45,000
molecules I want to try are um

598
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:48,658
what was the next one silver

599
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,339
silver by glycinate

600
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,620
it's never been

601
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:54,240
as far as I've under uh as far as I

602
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,339
understand it's never been it's never

603
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,620
been synthesized before it sounds like

604
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,959
it's chelated with two glycines which is

605
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:03,479
amino acid exactly yeah exactly exactly

606
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,460
so it's like uh

607
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,440
you can go to the health food store and

608
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,579
get all your minerals now as by

609
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,900
glycinates

610
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:14,699
calcium bioglotinate magnesium so um I

611
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,798
figured out uh

612
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,600
I think I figured out the path like I

613
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,538
think you gotta you gotta make silver

614
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:24,240
oxide and then and then uh do a swab

615
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:25,259
between silver oxide and glycine in

616
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,058
solution

617
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,220
I've also heard you can use just

618
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:31,379
gibberellic acid

619
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,779
that's right but that one's also not

620
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,140
super reliable from what I understand

621
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:39,720
and but I've like I've heard something I

622
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,620
heard like back in the day is

623
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,000
um you spray your uh your GAA before you

624
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:48,359
spray your silver

625
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,220
or after like one of the two and it like

626
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,959
gives a boost it gives a boost to the

627
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,079
silver that's what I've heard

628
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,360
yeah I've heard that it can increase the

629
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,639
pollen rights because a gibberellic acid

630
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,158
you know how you've got like a pollen

631
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,320
cluster it like it causes it all to

632
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,900
elongate yeah and it'll shoot it'll

633
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,839
shoot the like it'll spread the uh the

634
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,519
this diamonds apart and it probably

635
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,220
helps with the ejection of the pollen

636
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,619
too to get it out of that stamina like

637
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,419
uh like when I was just doing some

638
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,699
experiments there I

639
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,700
um one of the plants I sprayed it wasn't

640
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,038
like ejecting pollen so but when I dried

641
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,720
it and crushed in my fingertips

642
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:30,058
there's a bunch of pollen there on my

643
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,159
fingertips and I looked at it uh on your

644
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:33,778
scope I was looking at the inside of

645
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,240
that stamina and the inside of the

646
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:38,940
stamina it's like super cool it's like a

647
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,919
geode it's like a crystal geode but just

648
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,259
covered with pollen grains

649
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,259
so like the whole inside of those stamen

650
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:49,319
are growing uh it's just like a a a

651
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:52,679
layer of pollen growing on the inside of

652
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:54,000
it that's awesome the one one of the

653
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,620
plants I sprayed they just weren't

654
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,480
detaching so they just didn't have

655
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,819
enough

656
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,880
to finish the like to finish the

657
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:05,339
maturation and like crystallize so that

658
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,120
this this [ __ ] can like detach

659
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:11,459
yeah sure and out of um interest for our

660
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,678
listeners are there any specific sort of

661
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,659
feminized projects you're hoping to do

662
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,400
like any like cut like you know so I

663
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,559
think you've alluded that the Roberts

664
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,240
Creek Congo you're gonna reverse that so

665
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,558
we might see some hybrids with that in

666
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,798
the future

667
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:28,579
uh well basically we're going to reverse

668
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:32,400
everything and cross it to everything

669
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:35,158
okay every permutation possible that's

670
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,140
my goal with everything that everything

671
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,760
that uh everything that's tested you

672
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,200
know like tested cuttings that we have

673
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,319
in our collection

674
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,200
we've got like uh 50. we keep like 50

675
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:48,000
cuts at a time generally

676
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,558
and I like we like to get like

677
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,900
occasionally we get rid of you know

678
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,099
we'll Purge a bunch of stuff that uh

679
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,778
um

680
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:57,000
you know like just I just like to get

681
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:58,919
rid of stuff I'm like yeah this stuff is

682
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,380
good but uh like you know we have other

683
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,419
stuff that's better in that particular

684
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,220
category

685
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,778
um or like it we did some breeding with

686
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,778
it and wasn't a good reader show like

687
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:12,058
yeah get it out of here so given you've

688
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:14,880
got this like incredible collection of

689
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:17,158
females but not necessarily having been

690
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,860
able to cross them together but now

691
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:22,320
being able to which two females are you

692
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:24,000
really excited to see like The Offspring

693
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,579
of

694
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,319
for all of them that's a silly question

695
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,778
yeah you never know man once you start

696
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,720
doing this and you realize that um you

697
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:35,640
can make good uh good choices by having

698
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,620
good goals to go towards you know

699
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,960
getting used to knowing the plants and

700
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,459
what you're doing and how they grow and

701
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,000
what you want to add to that or take

702
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,159
away from that so yeah it's really uh I

703
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,319
mean you got to do everything yes yeah

704
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,179
and the other thing is like the coolest

705
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:54,480
[ __ ] comes out of the most unexpected

706
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,860
places yeah definitely like should you

707
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,079
just got to grow everything like

708
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:00,418
basically that's what you got to do as a

709
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,099
as someone that's looking for stuff is

710
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,140
you just got to grow everything you can

711
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:07,558
get your hands on yeah throw away throw

712
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,179
it all and uh smoke it all and then uh

713
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:10,379
like keep the best and then grow them

714
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,120
again you know like you got to grow

715
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,220
every single game

716
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,678
several times yeah

717
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,980
smoke it all again before it gets into

718
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,538
the house that's a good recipe say out

719
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,538
of curiosity I noticed you guys have got

720
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:26,940
the Congo Creek Haze it sounds insane

721
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:30,599
would you recommend it for someone like

722
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,058
myself who loves the Congo and wants to

723
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,918
have something similar to that or do you

724
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:36,119
think the haze is like you know quite

725
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,860
dominant and maybe there's an

726
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,778
alternative cross you offer where you

727
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:42,839
get a bit more of that Congo

728
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:46,259
uh if you don't mind uh like they can go

729
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,639
between uh like 11 to 15 weeks if you

730
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,038
don't mind running that long I would

731
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,340
highly recommend the Hayes Congo

732
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:55,200
definitely 100 bro yeah because it's

733
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:57,119
actually way it's actually well in our

734
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,819
we like it better I like it better than

735
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,199
the cargo picture yes extra extra

736
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:03,359
special yeah

737
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,880
it's like the Congo for me has a short

738
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,798
high uh the duration of the high isn't

739
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,659
very long I and I think that might be

740
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,759
like something to do with plants in that

741
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,220
time frame not sure yeah it's a faster

742
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,259
finishing plant you can't exist yeah

743
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,360
like yeah so yeah that makes sense for

744
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:20,220
sure yeah

745
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,740
but uh so the other days it has that

746
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,200
longer leg tie on it right that longer

747
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,079
creative high for a musician or a writer

748
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,019
or a drawer or a dancer or whatever you

749
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,960
know to get into that place yeah nice

750
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:37,259
yeah and it's a bit more complexity into

751
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,360
the flavors too but I mean there's

752
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,980
there's such like if your Congo has such

753
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,558
a cult following that people they just

754
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,179
want the Congo like a lot of people just

755
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,278
they just want that Congo they don't

756
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,778
want like no if you said Congo Haze to

757
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,500
them they would like slap you and they'd

758
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:54,058
be like no I just want to come

759
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,278
uh that's all right I'm not that much of

760
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,918
a purist I would be interested to know

761
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,079
though given you guys have grown such a

762
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,380
wide diversity of you know equatorial

763
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,178
strains and various sativas do you have

764
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,860
any sort of tips for people to grow them

765
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,620
indoors like I know that I've got this

766
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:12,839
friend he's an older guy and he grows a

767
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:15,178
lot of Thai and he puts heating mats

768
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,678
under his pots and he's like when I

769
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,899
asked him about it he goes oh I think

770
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm replicating the soil temperature of

771
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:24,000
the equatorial regions I was like that's

772
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,159
kind of interesting any weird fun

773
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,839
creative tips you've got at all I don't

774
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,640
necessarily agree with that because a

775
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,158
lot of the equatorial stuff is growing

776
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,159
on elevation so are they sure sure

777
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,440
they're going to be yeah and like uh

778
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,820
like they might they might be some of

779
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,740
those spots like Colombia it's not

780
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:42,480
necessarily super warm there like you go

781
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,220
into Bogota it's [ __ ] cold as far

782
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,839
yeah

783
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,919
um I mean not close black but it's like

784
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:52,678
uh what was imagines like uh all the

785
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,419
Eternal Spring right oh so yeah but it

786
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,840
did get pretty cold there in the 90s

787
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:59,340
right so those Colombian uh the guys

788
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,019
that are growing are like up in the

789
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:03,178
hills yeah definitely up in the hills

790
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,980
those Colombian genetics add a lot of

791
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,500
hardiness into anything we throw them

792
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,200
into so that's one of the things the

793
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,558
biosphere of Colombia is presenting

794
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,659
great genetics or our use

795
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:18,720
yeah nice okay well I mean do you have

796
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,899
any other tips for people to do indoor

797
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,558
sativas I think uh DJ Short says he

798
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:26,819
likes to do instead of 12 12 like 11 13.

799
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,519
do you do anything different like that

800
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:32,220
or you just approach it straight forward

801
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,000
you know what I like to do is

802
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,819
um

803
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,278
do the first eight weeks on a 12 12

804
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:43,200
schedule and then after eight weeks flip

805
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:45,058
it down to uh uh 11 13 and then uh and

806
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,240
then for a couple weeks and then and

807
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:49,619
then go until like uh 10 to 14 to the

808
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,720
Finish

809
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,219
so like yeah because you know they're

810
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,720
not they're not going to want to finish

811
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,538
uh like

812
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,380
in uh eight weeks early you know there's

813
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:03,658
no real advantage to look in my mind and

814
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,059
flipping the light down until like

815
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:09,120
after eight weeks

816
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:10,500
yeah so that makes sense

817
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,538
yeah so

818
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,898
the tip is

819
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:18,599
to try and get your plants down to 1014

820
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:21,298
um because otherwise they're just going

821
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,038
to keep spitting out pistols below those

822
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:24,898
tropical plants

823
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,240
that's a good tip because I hear that a

824
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:29,278
lot from guests that they have strains

825
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,278
that'll do that yeah you just got to get

826
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,898
you got to get it down to 10 to 14 or 11

827
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,940
13.

828
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:38,158
more it wants to keep flowering the more

829
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,019
you have to reduce it basically

830
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,840
but like some plants they just want they

831
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:44,639
just need like 20 weeks or 22 weeks and

832
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,879
there's just nothing you can do about it

833
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,740
the slow burn

834
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,659
one of the questions I like to ask all

835
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,058
of the guests we have on who have like

836
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,778
you know quite diverse seed libraries is

837
00:32:54,058 --> 00:33:00,119
what seeds in your library are like the

838
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:03,200
most special to you and what ones are

839
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,199
you most Keen to run

840
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:09,538
well for me I was like I have these

841
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:12,659
seeds called Rapa Nui uh Easter Island

842
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:14,700
and I've always like fantasized about

843
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,679
something special coming out of that in

844
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,000
a weird way but yeah but for me yeah

845
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,860
that's something that would really want

846
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,859
yeah it's like really hard to

847
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,599
like I was saying the weird the coolest

848
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:27,119
[ __ ] comes out of the weirdest places so

849
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:29,339
I just don't I mean definitely the

850
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,018
tropical stuff

851
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:33,480
um because that's what we like to grow

852
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:35,819
yeah gives the great eyes and the great

853
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,940
creative eyes and and uh yeah it's just

854
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:42,178
the I think as we move forward as like a

855
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,399
people you know we'll evolve a finer

856
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:46,798
Taste of cannabis kind of like the way

857
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:49,859
we do with wine and it'll become more

858
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,558
socially acceptable and you know we'll

859
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:54,139
get to share these things more often you

860
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,359
know as people

861
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,840
proliferate those genes more and more

862
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:03,119
yeah for sure so while we're on the

863
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,119
topic of growing from a a question or

864
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,918
two ago I haven't asked you guys yet

865
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,980
what uh style of growing do you use are

866
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,559
you soil are you soilless cocoa Hydro

867
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,800
what's your preferred method

868
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:20,579
uh Coco two-thirds cocoa one-third per

869
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,300
light and we make our own compost and we

870
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,179
um

871
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,519
pre-mixed accomplished uh like one to

872
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:31,019
ten or one day or whatever

873
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:32,579
into that mix and uh test it get a soil

874
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:34,259
test

875
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:37,739
and um

876
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,139
just uh just do basically water only but

877
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,059
uh maybe throw in a few

878
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,378
things that might be needed along the

879
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:45,179
way

880
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,618
try to keep it as simple as possible

881
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,780
because um

882
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,179
because we grow so many plants and we're

883
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,720
we're growing everything in the same mix

884
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:59,519
from like the craziest sativas uh to

885
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:02,399
like the most like sensitive sativas

886
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,559
um to like the most uh the hungriest uh

887
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,420
Indigo things

888
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,699
um but but what we figured out is we

889
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,559
just got a

890
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:12,719
the more sensitive stuff we'll just put

891
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:16,139
less compost into it

892
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:19,319
but like they all seem to like uh the

893
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:21,420
the plants like people you know plants

894
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,280
are like people they all seem to like uh

895
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,000
a certain uh

896
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,200
type of food

897
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,219
like they're all they all seem to be

898
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,960
reasonably happy with the same like meal

899
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,098
yeah I just we just try to keep it

900
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,220
simple

901
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:42,240
our compost is made from uh

902
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:44,759
a bunch of the old cocoa mix as the

903
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,639
Balkan Medium as the like the Browns the

904
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:52,020
carbon and then we um

905
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:56,460
we had a bunch of like uh Alfalfa uh

906
00:35:52,019 --> 00:36:00,440
soy meal soybean meal yeah

907
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:03,659
like six Rock phosphate

908
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,720
lime high calcium lime

909
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,420
gypsum

910
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,759
[Music]

911
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,980
um and then a bunch of the old compost

912
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,920
we'll throw that in there like five

913
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,820
percent as an inoculant

914
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,180
um

915
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:21,240
and we were using uh we made some imos

916
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:24,419
like knf style I'm always to inoculate

917
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:27,299
the compost piles before with just like

918
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,300
uh indigenous microbes yeah I am almost

919
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,880
from our forest around here and then and

920
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,160
then trace minerals and uh lately we've

921
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,500
been we take a bunch of like sulfate

922
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,899
trace minerals and dissolve them in

923
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,519
water and then mix them into biochar and

924
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,858
throw that in there it's pretty like

925
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,838
pretty complicated

926
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:49,380
um I don't really it's not like a method

927
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,119
I recommend that people try as you know

928
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,960
unless they really want to experiment

929
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,838
but uh we've been like

930
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,059
experimenting for uh like 15 years on

931
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,059
various recipes but we're finally like

932
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:05,639
right now the latest recipe is like

933
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:07,139
super close to um to where it needs to

934
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,900
be and uh

935
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:12,420
I think the last uh three years we

936
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,539
figured out how to like the like where

937
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,780
the recipe needs to be to to um totally

938
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:21,179
uh impervious to powdery mildew like the

939
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,160
like our plants don't grow like they

940
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,500
they won't grow powdery mildew because

941
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,940
uh like we basically we figured out when

942
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,699
you get a soil test there's something

943
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,700
called a base saturation for the the

944
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:34,259
cations cation-based saturation that's

945
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:36,899
like your calcium

946
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,280
there's the cation exchange sites and

947
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,200
they basically they

948
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,240
they measure

949
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,460
um how much of each of those ions each

950
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,819
of those cations is on the those cation

951
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,940
exchange sites like the ratio and uh

952
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:55,140
really they measure calcium potassium

953
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:57,300
magnesium uh sodium and hydrogen and uh

954
00:37:55,139 --> 00:38:00,118
uh what we figured out is

955
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,400
to like what worked for us is to to get

956
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,079
that calcium number is like insanely

957
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,760
high as possible

958
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,920
and and to use a bunch of different

959
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,440
calcium sources we've got like seven

960
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,559
different types of calcium in our mix

961
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,320
which includes the The Rock phosphate is

962
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,179
a source of calcium and the fishbone

963
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,740
meal like the stuff that has a lot of

964
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,739
calcium in it so

965
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:25,618
uh according to Carrie Reams

966
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:28,319
um he was saying that there's

967
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:29,880
so many different calcium molecules so

968
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,320
it's like nice to have all those

969
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,000
different calcium molecules available

970
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,000
for the plant

971
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,179
very comprehensive but yet still organic

972
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,179
and thus a man after my heart I love it

973
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:43,858
when you opened up with uh Coco I was

974
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:46,500
like okay here we go here we go we're

975
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:48,239
getting ready for it and like uh fish

976
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,159
this time of year you know we're on the

977
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,078
coast we'll take some fish and throw it

978
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,899
in a bucket and make some for a lot you

979
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,300
know let it eat up and you know so yeah

980
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,358
the local stuff is good you know we try

981
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,700
to get our stuff as local as we can

982
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,799
yeah we're trying to um

983
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:06,000
trying to close the loop as much as

984
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,240
possible

985
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,599
I love it I want to quickly ask you

986
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,338
what's the back story on the BC mango

987
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,338
because there's a breeder in Australia

988
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:19,139
whose name's ski mask seeds shout out uh

989
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:20,820
he's worked at a few generations and

990
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:23,279
he's doing some fun stuff with it and so

991
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,140
I was sort of interested to hear uh the

992
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,940
backstory on it and what sort of traits

993
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:28,980
do you remember it having

994
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,380
uh well I've never grown out that

995
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,880
particular hybrid but uh

996
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:38,400
I've seen test scores of it um it is the

997
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,460
cross is terminal please

998
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,160
the female was

999
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,720
Dutch Passion mango was a Dutch Passion

1000
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,838
that had the mango I think it might have

1001
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,879
been Casey Brian's Casey brains yeah

1002
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:54,779
Casey brains that's right Casey brains

1003
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,820
that was a uh a BC like a BC selected

1004
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,760
cut or like a Vancouver Island selected

1005
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,500
kind of of the mango and then a guy

1006
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,680
named detox

1007
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,338
in like a mid Vancouver Island

1008
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:10,440
uh he crossed it with cream sodaka we

1009
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:11,880
grow out a bunch of those and we just

1010
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,220
seriously those things are all over the

1011
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,960
place like like I said that cream so

1012
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:19,559
okay will give you every variation of

1013
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,599
color possible Leaf color Bud color

1014
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,539
uh all sorts of like they're really

1015
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,859
dense there's cream sodica crosses so

1016
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,759
they're they're really nice like they

1017
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:28,759
look nice and stuff

1018
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:37,440
um but uh

1019
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,779
we've selected out uh a semi-auto fan

1020
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,338
all of that that's like super hard to

1021
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,560
keep and it was super hard to keep in

1022
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:46,320
veg and when you would put it out it

1023
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,000
just wouldn't it was it was like the

1024
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,338
mighty might you'd put it out and it

1025
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,199
would only grow uh like three feet tall

1026
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:54,119
or whatever

1027
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,739
for all intensive purposes it was

1028
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,079
autofiring

1029
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:00,299
um but I classified as semi-auto

1030
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,420
so anyways that was that was the female

1031
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,339
side and uh we crossed that with uh

1032
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,358
Northern Lights that came from Steve

1033
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,699
tuck

1034
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:11,880
and Steve tuck used to work in Holland

1035
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:14,039
for I believe he worked for uh Scentsy

1036
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,380
uh

1037
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,739
Dutch Passion one of those

1038
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:22,200
so he he claimed he had like a a good an

1039
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:26,459
online didn't seemed to be all right

1040
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:29,699
nice yeah but like that that particular

1041
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,800
NL line I grew it outdoors in uh BC and

1042
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,739
it actually like this should actually

1043
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,240
worked Outdoors so

1044
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:39,259
yeah it actually uh had good mold

1045
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:42,059
resistance and was relatively early

1046
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:45,300
interesting stuff another another

1047
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:48,019
cutting from back in the day the UBC

1048
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,400
chemo that was like a real famous

1049
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:52,380
Canadian clone

1050
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,838
um and you occasionally see people bring

1051
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,579
it up today but not too many people have

1052
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:58,619
it

1053
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:00,660
what what made that cut unique you know

1054
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:02,338
and and how would you describe it to

1055
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:04,618
people I've never tried it or smelled so

1056
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:08,039
I've got no idea what it's like I would

1057
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:09,660
call it a wheelchair weed like it didn't

1058
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:11,639
have a lot of character but it had a

1059
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:14,940
good uh medicinal properties like very

1060
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:17,940
uh narcoleptic and uh you know green

1061
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,858
apple sour green apple kind of yeah and

1062
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,220
it was nice uh they're kind of like they

1063
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:26,039
look like it looked like a Nepalese

1064
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:30,118
definitely I'd really like uh

1065
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:31,619
serrated sharp uh thin leaves and there

1066
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,300
was two fennels there's a short minnow

1067
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,300
from Montreal and then the West yeah but

1068
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,280
that's not that's has nothing to do yeah

1069
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,200
there's there's another chemo in in

1070
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,260
Montreal that like kind of confused the

1071
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:46,319
city yeah yeah but it was like unrelated

1072
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:49,740
but ironically it came from BC from some

1073
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,500
some dreddy dead man island is that what

1074
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:54,239
they said yeah yeah

1075
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,800
at Denman Island or Deadman Island but

1076
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:00,139
the French guy kept saying dead man

1077
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:03,260
Island and I'm like oh Denman Islands

1078
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:06,719
that's great are there any other

1079
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:08,760
Canadian genetics that you think deserve

1080
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,980
more of a rep but have never really got

1081
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,780
the attention they Merit

1082
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,818
well a lot there's a lot of stuff that's

1083
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,099
extinct that we can't even say you know

1084
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:18,420
like that Queen who knows like and some

1085
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,460
of those hash plants are pretty cool

1086
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,619
they're just not like a lot of this

1087
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,659
stuff back then was a little bit rougher

1088
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,720
like it's not the same it's you know

1089
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:30,239
it's like tops out at 20 or uh 20

1090
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:32,759
whatever percent THC like the

1091
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,219
that's the difference like the the you

1092
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,420
know the stocks the the trichome stocks

1093
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:38,219
are smaller you know like they're not

1094
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,440
the this really flashy read from today

1095
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:42,598
with really long trichome stocks that

1096
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,059
like bend over and reflect the light

1097
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:47,280
really well and like cover all the

1098
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:49,500
foliage so all you see are like these

1099
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,760
shiny trichomes you know trichom stocks

1100
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,099
like so

1101
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,020
yeah just on the like the cannabinoid

1102
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,338
ratio and the way it looks and you'll

1103
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:59,519
not as

1104
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:01,679
um it's not as uh nice in the bag

1105
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,900
yeah it's definitely evolved for sure

1106
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,598
and like uh the flavors were different

1107
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:11,639
back then like the hash plant was really

1108
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:16,440
uh uh rancid yeah it's like around said

1109
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:17,940
um like uh popcorn parts and and uh

1110
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,800
um

1111
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,139
it just reminded me of like something

1112
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,599
like rancid oils or something like brown

1113
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:28,078
said uh

1114
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,880
socks I think you all around this box I

1115
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,400
was gonna say pee pants but I didn't

1116
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,140
want to bring into it so yeah yeah they

1117
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,500
got they all got but it's kind of a cool

1118
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:38,219
one yeah the uh the Jordan godbud yeah

1119
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,338
yeah

1120
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:43,980
and that's uh it's like off County uh

1121
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:46,078
perps that cross like he had like a

1122
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,358
Scentsy Afghan Afghan one or something

1123
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,339
like that um

1124
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:53,460
that uh they had there was an old cut

1125
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:56,279
called Perks that was uh from the island

1126
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,460
it's like Afghani or Pakistani or

1127
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,460
something

1128
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,000
um and it would finish outside but it's

1129
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,519
like not uh it's it's good it's really

1130
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,079
good it's got uh nice medicinal

1131
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,358
qualities but today it would just be

1132
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,519
like whatever you know people would

1133
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,799
more or less would pass it over

1134
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,940
you know because it's not like a super

1135
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,240
uh

1136
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:21,059
flashy and type Buds and harder to grow

1137
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:25,139
yeah it's it's not like super loud or

1138
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:27,179
anything but anyways uh uh Jordan uh I

1139
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,098
believe you crossed did the cross in the

1140
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:32,279
back cross with Afghani and then came

1141
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:35,280
out with this a selection called called

1142
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:38,400
the Jordan Scott bud and um

1143
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,839
that one's like super stinky it was it

1144
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,639
was popular for about five minutes

1145
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,699
before everyone realized it was the

1146
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,440
stinkiest plant going and everyone's and

1147
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,699
it was a really uh really a little

1148
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,920
bigger

1149
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:52,799
it's a Vegit out it was just took a long

1150
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,818
time to veg your plants up yeah

1151
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,940
um but it was it was super uh stinky and

1152
00:45:56,818 --> 00:46:04,139
it had a nice

1153
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:06,838
rancid uh old man pee pants with uh

1154
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,039
with grape it's a nice great flavors in

1155
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:10,078
there

1156
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,599
yeah look I've had some nice God but

1157
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,240
before uh just grown from seed probably

1158
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:18,180
not the select clone but it was nice

1159
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,259
stuff I gotta say but I did want to ask

1160
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:21,659
you because I've been wondering about

1161
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,180
this forever this is a bit of a

1162
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:26,219
throwback one for you see Ray but um the

1163
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:27,838
gorilla gold that's that's an

1164
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:30,000
interesting strain I think you were a

1165
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,799
part of the creation of that were you do

1166
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,019
like if if so can you give me some of

1167
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,339
the back story on it and as just a quick

1168
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:38,460
follow-up

1169
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:40,920
I read rumors online that it involved um

1170
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,539
Mighty might in the breeding is that

1171
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,180
true

1172
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:48,300
actually uh uh scar be nice more about

1173
00:46:45,179 --> 00:46:51,239
that one um yeah yeah Mighty mate Afghan

1174
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:55,140
would be money made Afghan early gold so

1175
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:57,899
there was uh money made Afghan and just

1176
00:46:55,139 --> 00:47:01,139
to talk about the the mighty mate Afghan

1177
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:04,139
seed line oh okay yeah like uh I guess

1178
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:06,598
the mighty mate was uh thrown around

1179
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:07,739
here a lot it's very very tiny little

1180
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,200
short plan

1181
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:12,899
and uh yeah it would grow like three

1182
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:14,818
feet it was uh semi-auto so you keep

1183
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,200
your mom and veg make a bunch of cuts

1184
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:18,119
throw them out and they'd only grow like

1185
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,039
three foot one big stick

1186
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:23,039
and you could grow it in a bunch of pots

1187
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,900
and put it in you know like uh a drip

1188
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,699
system Outdoors

1189
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,260
um yeah I finished really quick it was

1190
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:29,818
one of the quicker ones that people did

1191
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,119
so they could get it off to the market

1192
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:35,460
but it didn't last very long and uh the

1193
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,760
guys were throwing the afghanis around

1194
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,579
uh at the time and it uh yeah they they

1195
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,220
had that was it you think it was a

1196
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:45,660
um the auto Afghan from Scentsy seeds

1197
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:47,399
that they threw into that

1198
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:48,239
or was it just because it was a mighty

1199
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,160
might

1200
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,259
it's hard to say yeah it's hard to say

1201
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,078
because they were like dead grateful

1202
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,599
Head Grateful Dead uh you know hippies

1203
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:00,300
that just use various names like this is

1204
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,039
Afghan but it could be you know oh yeah

1205
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,480
anyways they had it they had us there's

1206
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,000
a seed line

1207
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:09,000
that was circulating around the the

1208
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,760
northern Gulf Islands yeah of Mighty

1209
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,460
might afghan that they inbred

1210
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,700
and then it get crossed into this uh

1211
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:21,480
early gold cutting which was a Himalayan

1212
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:24,659
and it flowered really quickly uh a very

1213
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,579
sparse Bud uh and it would be one of the

1214
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:28,078
first ones we would cut down and you're

1215
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,000
talking about their early goals yeah the

1216
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,940
early goal talking about the Himalayan

1217
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,280
side of it and where did that come from

1218
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:37,500
a guy in Ontario that's all I know

1219
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,480
that's all I know about it but I all I

1220
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:44,179
know is Himalayan and it made one of the

1221
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:46,980
uh most uh soupiest hashes like meltiest

1222
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:50,279
ashes you've ever seen it like stick to

1223
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,719
everything and yeah so the guys were

1224
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,800
just trying to find stuff that would

1225
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:58,259
finish outside here and uh mixing all

1226
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,960
this stuff together at uh yeah the early

1227
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,700
Bramble became oh yeah the first

1228
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,159
generation of gorilla gold was called

1229
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:08,000
early Bramble really ramble by Texada

1230
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:08,000
Island Seed Company

1231
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,279
yeah but it was it was Texas I don't see

1232
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,318
so many patches that oh yeah Patchwork

1233
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,800
seeds Patrick seeds uh through

1234
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:22,199
Montgomery seed and kind yeah

1235
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,119
yeah so that was the first generation of

1236
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:27,598
the gorilla gold and then it got passed

1237
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,099
to breeder Brad in Ontario and he did

1238
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,838
some work with it

1239
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,400
um and then he passed it to a guy in

1240
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:35,099
Manitoba

1241
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,639
uh we went by Greens on

1242
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,539
a form called unleashed the the green

1243
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,179
um

1244
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:45,779
and then and then he said he uh sent me

1245
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:47,699
some seeds and I did some work with it

1246
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,980
which is kind of funny because it's

1247
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:52,199
originated here and then it went across

1248
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,900
down right back to the same [ __ ] spot

1249
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:58,279
yeah pretty weird yeah they were right

1250
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:01,500
we're pretty close to Texas

1251
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,079
interesting stuff interesting stuff

1252
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:06,480
I was also curious to know you're in one

1253
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,420
of your crosses you use an island purple

1254
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,099
Indica do you happen to know is that the

1255
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,440
same one that goes around like

1256
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:16,680
Washington and Oregon the it's just

1257
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,940
called Purple Indica I don't think so

1258
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:20,118
yeah I think that one's different

1259
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:24,780
because I was looking at it uh uh uh

1260
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:27,559
inspect uh grows it I think yeah yeah

1261
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,119
um it's different I'm pretty sure

1262
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:32,519
but yeah they call that they call it the

1263
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:35,700
perps or the Vancouver Island groups or

1264
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:37,500
the Vancouver and purple Indica but I

1265
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,939
think it's just it's just a generic name

1266
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,818
you know purple index I'm sure there's

1267
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,159
like a thousands it's got really awesome

1268
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:46,920
candy smell and taste it's really

1269
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,259
beautiful like but it's yeah it's just

1270
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,940
um it's one of those plants that's just

1271
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,800
um real hard to grow it's a pain in the

1272
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,358
US to grow and it's just there's a lot

1273
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,240
of easier things to grow and it was like

1274
00:50:54,358 --> 00:51:00,299
a later finishing outdoor plant back

1275
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:02,959
then so it's just too late of a finisher

1276
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,579
nowadays here

1277
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,260
but still it's still around

1278
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:10,260
it's one of the old ones it's probably

1279
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,480
from the 90s if I had to guess yeah I

1280
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,059
mean there's still people growing up

1281
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,920
speaking of ones from the 90s early

1282
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:18,900
2000s

1283
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:22,019
I think you're involved in the Willie

1284
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,700
Nelson with reefer man is is that true

1285
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:25,079
at all and and I guess as a general

1286
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:26,939
follow-up whether that's true or not

1287
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:28,619
it's a pretty popular strain from

1288
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,539
everything I read but like no one really

1289
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:33,000
seems to hold on to it anymore do you

1290
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:35,818
know why that might be

1291
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,079
uh well when you grow the seeds you know

1292
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:38,579
there's um

1293
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:40,500
variation

1294
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:42,300
um but we we got the we got the cup

1295
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,280
winning cup out of like growing a few

1296
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,800
f1s like a couple bucks or two or three

1297
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,380
packs at one so

1298
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,318
um there's some good Cuts in there

1299
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,960
yeah I like the lemony ones the the yeah

1300
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:57,599
the the sort of like beautiful Rusty

1301
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,179
lemonade or whatever yeah there's some

1302
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,800
uh there's some ones that I classify as

1303
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:05,399
old lady perfume

1304
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:08,519
they've got this uh like uh

1305
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,660
very floral you know smell but with this

1306
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,679
electric like lemon juice smell in there

1307
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:16,739
there's definitely some good ones in

1308
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:19,558
there um the PM resistance wasn't the

1309
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:21,659
wasn't the best on those so you know

1310
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:24,300
that may I don't know if that's part of

1311
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:26,338
it but also they're uh you know they're

1312
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:30,180
was people don't hang on to stuff that's

1313
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:32,639
more than 10 weeks flowering you know so

1314
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:36,739
I said probably a large part of it and I

1315
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,739
never liked that Vietnamese black mother

1316
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,440
yeah

1317
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:42,358
they're they're all right um there's

1318
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,460
definitely some good ones in there um

1319
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:46,019
but we you know we also sent around that

1320
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,619
uh the the

1321
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:52,139
the the cup cut and uh like I don't you

1322
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:54,539
know that was a long time ago

1323
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:57,659
yeah things things get lost over time

1324
00:52:54,539 --> 00:53:00,119
and like I was saying in the states uh

1325
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:01,078
um it's hard I think it's harder to keep

1326
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,760
that's

1327
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,599
around there

1328
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,880
certainly so from the breeding point of

1329
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,280
view how do you go about testing your

1330
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,260
males one of our listeners was wondering

1331
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,420
and specifically they wanted to know

1332
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,220
like with the haze is because you can

1333
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,440
see on your Instagram that you flower

1334
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:21,779
the boys out and you really like to look

1335
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,338
at them and that's great and I guess

1336
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,440
they're sort of wondering given that

1337
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:27,358
some of these hazes can go a long time

1338
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,800
is there another way you do it or do you

1339
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,380
just like rough it out and you're like I

1340
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,440
got a flower this thing that holds by

1341
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:37,380
well we uh when we initially grew those

1342
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,838
there was six males and uh

1343
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,579
like we we like to do a good flowering

1344
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,078
of them and then just and then

1345
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:44,640
constantly smelling them because those

1346
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,500
males are just constantly changing

1347
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,719
smells

1348
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,818
um we just like get it right get right

1349
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,399
in there and smell them like try and get

1350
00:53:50,818 --> 00:53:55,139
in there at the peak flowering um like

1351
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,960
just constantly smelling them every week

1352
00:53:55,139 --> 00:54:00,000
and uh it's pretty obvious like when you

1353
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,318
grow the females like the whole the

1354
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,838
whole idea

1355
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:05,219
um doing selections and uh inbreeding

1356
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,440
and like trying to pair the ones

1357
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:09,659
together that you like is uh

1358
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,338
you grow the females first and you find

1359
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:13,379
the females you like and then you try

1360
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:15,058
and like get a good handle on what the

1361
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,800
smells coming off those are and then you

1362
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:18,720
go look at your males

1363
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,119
and uh try and just try and match up

1364
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,679
those smells I mean as for the

1365
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,500
from the point of view trying to find

1366
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,419
the best uh you know the best smells

1367
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,280
that might correlate to

1368
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,380
it was like the highest or that you're

1369
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,839
looking for

1370
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,460
but yeah so we uh we had six initially

1371
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,318
and then we selected three out of those

1372
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,480
and then um

1373
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:43,980
we just cross those like those three

1374
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:46,139
males we cross to some of the others

1375
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,420
um but then we um we still had the

1376
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:50,639
original three males and then we we

1377
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,280
stuck the three males outside they were

1378
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:56,400
basically those those six males they

1379
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,559
segregated into two there was two types

1380
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,139
I would say two types

1381
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,079
um one that was more lemongrassy and

1382
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:06,480
grassy like the lawn smelling

1383
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,760
and and uh those were the ones that we

1384
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,838
didn't favor and the ones that we

1385
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:16,020
favored are more uh citrusy uh

1386
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:18,239
uh like tropical flowery

1387
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:20,818
they also had like this crazy onion

1388
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,019
smell in them as well

1389
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,599
um which apparently I've been told

1390
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:27,539
that's that's a sign of a true like a

1391
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:31,380
good Haze how's that onion smell in it

1392
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:33,960
so there must be some weird uh terpene

1393
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,720
so yeah we stuck those three uh males

1394
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,240
like clones of those males outside

1395
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,500
um in like September um just to see what

1396
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:42,179
they would do

1397
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,579
and uh

1398
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:46,078
there was one that was just like it

1399
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:47,940
looked like it actually liked it outside

1400
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,039
the other two were like yeah no this

1401
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,099
sucks we're not uh meant to be growing

1402
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:54,659
in outdoors in the coast of BC

1403
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,800
um but the one guy was like yeah this is

1404
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:58,980
all right

1405
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,619
uh and they were like we like we grew

1406
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,179
out some of the the crosses with all

1407
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:05,220
three males and they were all like good

1408
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:06,960
like the ones that you could tell which

1409
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:08,279
ones came from each male just on the

1410
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,039
nodal spacing

1411
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,559
and like the bud structure

1412
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,659
um but the ones that had they had like

1413
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:16,980
really nice bud structure outdoors and

1414
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:18,420
they were flowering like they're the

1415
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,920
males were flowering pretty decently and

1416
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,159
they had they actually had pretty good

1417
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,760
uh mold resistance

1418
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:25,858
um

1419
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,599
they're just uh like it's just a

1420
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:29,098
superior growing plant like the highs

1421
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,079
were the same and the player like the

1422
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:32,460
Terps were pretty similar but yeah the

1423
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,500
the structure and everything they're

1424
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,000
just way Superior for growing and

1425
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,380
they're like uh fought a little bit

1426
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,539
faster finishing

1427
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,220
um So eventually we just uh we got rid

1428
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:42,900
of the other two Haze nails and just

1429
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:44,639
kept that one to

1430
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,139
to breed with

1431
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:47,159
and then we eventually

1432
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:49,199
um

1433
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:53,338
we cross out with uh there's a local

1434
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:55,078
cutting of the seedsman original Haze

1435
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:57,539
um from one of our buddies back in the

1436
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,700
day that he gave us and we crossed out

1437
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:02,159
with the uh

1438
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:04,019
original Haze our original Haze stud

1439
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,519
mail and we've just started growing out

1440
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:08,699
some of those and we're gonna like

1441
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:11,338
continue forward with that as a line

1442
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:14,699
and we just did a

1443
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:16,858
50 oh we grew at like 50 seedlings and

1444
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,318
uh there's like 30

1445
00:57:16,858 --> 00:57:23,159
emails in there

1446
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:27,719
and from those 30 we selected out two

1447
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:29,639
but one is like Superior for a high-wise

1448
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:31,558
um they're both like they both smell

1449
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:34,078
really good

1450
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:35,519
um one's a little bit faster but uh like

1451
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,740
a little bit longer flowering one that's

1452
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:41,880
the one we're gonna use for um

1453
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:43,558
we were doing some feminis crosses

1454
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,180
so like we've done a bunch of these

1455
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,700
crosses with

1456
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:50,098
original Haze males so now we want to

1457
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:51,899
replicate those ones that worked out

1458
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:55,140
good with uh

1459
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,480
with the female feminized Style

1460
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:59,338
nice that's exciting you you actually

1461
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,838
managed to bang off a few questions I

1462
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:02,699
was going to ask you about what can we

1463
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:03,960
look forward to in the near future so

1464
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:06,960
that's exciting

1465
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,059
I guess we've just got a few patreon

1466
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,800
questions before we get to the final

1467
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,839
little quick fire ones we do with

1468
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,740
everyone I'd be interested to hear your

1469
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:16,858
answer to this one because you've got

1470
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:20,399
such a vast experience with it what is

1471
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:21,960
the best outdoor variety to you and what

1472
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,180
makes a strand good for outdoor from

1473
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,338
your perspective

1474
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:28,379
it's worth growing

1475
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:30,058
like it's good enough to smoke like a

1476
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,920
lot of outdoor stuff is

1477
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:34,319
in this day and age just like the

1478
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,838
standard is the standards are way higher

1479
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,639
than it was for us back in the day so

1480
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:40,019
like we're in a tough spot for growing

1481
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:41,699
and really we should just be growing

1482
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:42,838
everything in a greenhouse

1483
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:43,980
um

1484
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:47,159
but it's

1485
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:49,079
you know we're it's also nice to be able

1486
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:50,639
to breed or like grow something not just

1487
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:52,200
grow straight outdoors and gives you a

1488
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,818
really nice quality product but it's

1489
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:56,879
like really

1490
00:58:53,818 --> 00:59:00,358
really hard to pull that off here

1491
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,220
you got to grow a ton of plants and

1492
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:04,858
like you need you need to grow like a

1493
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:06,539
thousands thousands of plants to also

1494
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:07,798
like to come out with a good like really

1495
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:08,940
good outdoor strain that's where it's

1496
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,679
growing

1497
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,599
that ticks all the boxes like a lot of

1498
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:15,779
outdoor stuff is just

1499
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:17,940
developed just to be uh mold resistant

1500
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,798
uh like good enough to finish

1501
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,179
and make it you know a good looking

1502
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,099
product and

1503
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:25,558
the good like don't get me wrong it's

1504
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:27,720
good medicine and stuff but um it's not

1505
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:31,140
what people expect in the standing yeah

1506
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:32,818
people are just are over yeah the whole

1507
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:34,679
outdoor thing died it was like a really

1508
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:37,259
big Community thing they want their

1509
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:39,358
quads and their their pants it's all

1510
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,319
kind of just faded away with the market

1511
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,539
yeah

1512
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:45,298
definitely a sentiment we've heard from

1513
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:46,500
other guests as well ironically in the

1514
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:50,039
legal Market

1515
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:52,619
there's now eight hectares of outdoor

1516
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:53,759
growing grown for every hectare of

1517
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:56,460
indoor

1518
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,260
so the legal Market is uh

1519
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:01,019
I think a lot of it just gets turned

1520
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,280
into oil and edible so there's uh like

1521
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:06,059
the carts

1522
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,160
the carts are huge in the legal Market

1523
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:10,099
and the like the markups on carts are

1524
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:15,058
insane

1525
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:19,140
so in your opinion what are some of the

1526
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:21,480
best varieties you guys offer for flower

1527
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:23,578
and what are the best for Harsh we've

1528
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,280
got some concentrate enthusiasts in our

1529
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:28,019
patreon crew and so yeah what what would

1530
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,819
you recommend for flour and what would

1531
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:33,380
you recommend for hash just in terms of

1532
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:33,380
your personally what you like

1533
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:39,420
well all the uh all the new Irene um

1534
01:00:36,739 --> 01:00:42,719
sorry all the new Iraqi crosses are

1535
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:44,460
getting good reviews so

1536
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,379
we grew a bunch of them they were all

1537
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,920
pretty awesome

1538
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,000
um like it all depends how I when people

1539
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,039
ask me

1540
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,039
um you know would you recommend I always

1541
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,079
ask first uh how many which you know

1542
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:59,818
what do you like to smoke and would you

1543
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,680
like to grow

1544
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:02,759
um how many will weeks are you willing

1545
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,358
to go

1546
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:08,220
if you're into longer flowering stuff so

1547
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:10,500
we're just you know we try to

1548
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:12,480
have a little bit of Indica like froster

1549
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,119
flower and stuff but our main focus is

1550
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,019
uh like longer far and stuff

1551
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,720
um

1552
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:21,000
so I don't know I feel like the question

1553
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,779
is you know are you

1554
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,358
um

1555
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:27,319
you willing are you a sativa Enthusiast

1556
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:29,659
or you know are you

1557
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:32,099
sativa are curious

1558
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:34,019
or you could break it down like this you

1559
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:35,940
could break it down like uh sativa

1560
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:37,440
strains and hash they don't yield very

1561
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,119
well so they're not going to be put into

1562
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,980
the market at all people aren't going to

1563
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,039
try them a lot you know it's like a

1564
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:45,900
labor of love kind of thing and where

1565
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:48,298
you have these fancy glossy cushions

1566
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,639
that make really good Ash returns you

1567
01:01:48,298 --> 01:01:53,338
know and uh so you could you could break

1568
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,519
it up like that kind of thing yeah but

1569
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:58,380
we haven't like we haven't washed uh

1570
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:00,199
we haven't watched any of these Iraqi

1571
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:03,358
crosses yet yeah

1572
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:06,358
but we're going to do um we gotta we got

1573
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:09,900
a GMO and uh Forum cut so we'll do Iraqi

1574
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:12,598
uh gml form process I'm sure there's a

1575
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,680
wash yeah they can probably count not

1576
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:16,680
much

1577
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,419
I like that but we don't we don't uh

1578
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:20,159
like we're not like we're not making

1579
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:22,019
hash so

1580
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,480
um we're not washing stuff

1581
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:26,699
so that's not really our Focus

1582
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,699
we do a lot of live resin right now so

1583
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:32,039
we get to uh yeah but at some point like

1584
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:34,019
it's it's definitely uh

1585
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,298
something that we have to do is because

1586
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:37,980
a lot of people are asking for it so you

1587
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:39,838
have to start washing a bunch of stuff

1588
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,699
and like I'm trying to get stuff to

1589
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:43,380
people that want to do those test washes

1590
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:45,298
so yeah there's people out there that

1591
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,940
want to do test washes so maybe we'll

1592
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:50,579
slip you some test seeds

1593
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:54,420
yeah please everyone if you can get in

1594
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:56,519
touch uh one of that listeners said

1595
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:58,680

just to confirm because I've seen you

1640
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,858
describe it on the side as uh with the

1641
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:53,280
word skunk in there the pineapple skunk

1642
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:55,798
do you think that it's like uh a

1643
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,359
Jamaican quote land race that sort of

1644
01:04:55,798 --> 01:05:00,000
happens to be like that or do you think

1645
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:02,338
it's some sort of hybrid European

1646
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,858
influence something

1647
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:07,980
there's not there's no such thing like

1648
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:10,380
nowadays as a Jamaican language no yeah

1649
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,780
yeah yeah there's a

1650
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:15,780
I mean from what I can tell us

1651
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:17,760
guys save seed there and uh you know

1652
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,680
they don't um

1653
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:23,220
there's not a lot of stuff left over

1654
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,960
from the Glory Days so they take what

1655
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,759
works and what they like and they keep

1656
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,338
moving forward with it you know I think

1657
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,380
that's the major mentality and uh yeah

1658
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:32,759
there's like some of them had the kicker

1659
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,619
high and some of them didn't that's what

1660
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:39,780
it boiled down to really I mean yeah

1661
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:41,519
yeah okay sure it's probably a mix of uh

1662
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,420
you know various hybrids yeah I would

1663
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:45,420
imagine

1664
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,420
foreign

1665
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,880
[Laughter]

1666
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:52,680
so another one of our listeners asked

1667
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,579
would they be able to tell us a little

1668
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:59,039
bit about the Highland Nepalese father

1669
01:05:55,579 --> 01:06:00,420
that was in the ganja wise crosses I

1670
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,279
have to admit I'm not familiar with what

1671
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,980
they're talking about

1672
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,380
uh ganja was there um some friends of

1673
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:10,798
ours that run some of our stuff

1674
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:13,140
so yeah it's uh it's just the same male

1675
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:14,699
that was used for Willie Nelson back in

1676
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:15,960
the day I mean not the same but it was

1677
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:19,039
like done

1678
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,760
but yeah I'd say um

1679
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:25,139
skunky

1680
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:27,780
um it's very hashy like skunk uh like uh

1681
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:29,098
and kind of uh

1682
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:31,380
I think

1683
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:34,200
it's it's really good it's like a really

1684
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:36,180
good uh representation of the of the old

1685
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:38,639
school uh Nepalese shoe house if you've

1686
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:41,338
ever had that

1687
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,538
um slightly uh citrusy

1688
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:44,338
um

1689
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:47,039
but it's one of the best it's one of the

1690
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:49,380
best traditional hashes I've ever had is

1691
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,819
The Nepalese uh like they call it shoe

1692
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,880
hash because it came

1693
01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:55,739
the first part of the shoes to uh

1694
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,539
like the

1695
01:06:55,739 --> 01:07:00,058
what do you call the heel of the shoe or

1696
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:02,700
something they would put or the yeah to

1697
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:04,319
press it yeah so let no like they'd

1698
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:07,259
smuggle in shoes I think they were

1699
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:09,960
smuggled as shoes or something like that

1700
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:13,079
that's interesting cool to hear cool to

1701
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:15,960
hear I've asked you about the original

1702
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:17,760
Haze and the gorilla gold the one other

1703
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:21,059
strain that got brought up a few times

1704
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,920
by our listeners was the Whitey can you

1705
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:24,720
tell me anything about that at all yeah

1706
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:28,380
it's uh

1707
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:31,558
came from a guy called THC development

1708
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:34,619
and I got a he was on uh like unleash

1709
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:38,339
the green form and uh but he was selling

1710
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,838
it through um the the uh retail side of

1711
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:42,739
unleashed the Green Farm

1712
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:46,739
um uh and it was uh said it was a white

1713
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:49,139
S1 but I like we grew out these Whitey

1714
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:53,038
uh like they're called Whitey and the

1715
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:55,798
guy said it was uh the white s ones

1716
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,920
um that he like he made like he wrote

1717
01:07:55,798 --> 01:08:00,000
some weight s ones and he found a male

1718
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,760
in there

1719
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,460
and uh he did a back cross back to the

1720
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,480
white he was able to get then this is

1721
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,480
his story

1722
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:12,480
um like that as I recall

1723
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:15,019
yeah he he got a white the white uh

1724
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,000
cutting and yeah that crossed it with

1725
01:08:15,019 --> 01:08:21,659
this male that came out of Kelly

1726
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,798
connection the white uh s ones

1727
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:25,920
um

1728
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:27,600
and uh apparently like a lot of best

1729
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,399
ones if you grow enough there'll be

1730
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,319
males that pop out like one out of every

1731
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:34,019
three or four thousand so

1732
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:36,539
yeah I mean I either it's like a like

1733
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,799
one of those males which I wouldn't be

1734
01:08:36,539 --> 01:08:40,380
too surprised because it was kind of

1735
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:43,619
weird there's some weird things about it

1736
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:45,600
so yeah we grew uh some of those they

1737
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,698
were male female seeds

1738
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,160
um but I mean it could have been just a

1739
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:53,219
pollen contamination too

1740
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:56,698
but yeah it's a white it's seven it

1741
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:59,159
would be 75 the white uh cut

1742
01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:02,219
yeah we grew out uh

1743
01:08:59,159 --> 01:09:04,500
I got like three or four packs of those

1744
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:07,140
wrote a bunch of them and we like out of

1745
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,119
all those we only found like uh

1746
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:11,819
a couple like a male and a female that

1747
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:13,738
we were that we really liked of those

1748
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:16,080
and we made more seeds

1749
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:18,778
but yeah the cool thing was this is a

1750
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:21,179
kind of an interesting story

1751
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,980
um we had this carport uh that we were

1752
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:26,640
just keeping uh

1753
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:28,678
a bunch of our uh mothers

1754
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,600
um well like in the winter time

1755
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:32,399
we just had a carport with a light and

1756
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,560
like we just keep the light on

1757
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,420
um and that was enough Pete to keep the

1758
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,798
thing in the winter like it would go

1759
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:40,440
down to uh

1760
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:43,319
goes down to like -10 here in the winter

1761
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:45,539
um anyway so I was uh we were growing

1762
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,400
this cardboard and uh one day I was in

1763
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:49,560
there and I'm like oh bummer there's

1764
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:51,119
some plants getting PM um and I just

1765
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,699
kind of ignored it and then I went back

1766
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:56,219
I'm like damn like there's like PM

1767
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:58,919
starting to spread here

1768
01:09:56,219 --> 01:10:01,800
and I was just like uh so busy at the

1769
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,600
time that like I just uh like it wasn't

1770
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,940
a priority because I it was just like

1771
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,100
some extra cuttings that we didn't need

1772
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:09,359
but we had like most of our uh

1773
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,120
collection in there

1774
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,519
anyways I'm at one point I was like yeah

1775
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:16,859
this is kind of a waste like I was just

1776
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,719
gonna chop them all down start over but

1777
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:21,599
then I thought to myself like why don't

1778
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:25,679
we just like Let It Go and uh see uh

1779
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,140
like Let It Go and we can see

1780
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:31,140
um which plants have the best resistance

1781
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:32,579
like we can kind of see as we go along

1782
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:34,320
um which plants are more resistant

1783
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:36,000
because they won't get like they'll like

1784
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,099
what are the plants that don't like that

1785
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,100
get PM the loud you know

1786
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,960
the like at the very end which plants

1787
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,520
can hold out to the very end it was like

1788
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,039
a very um

1789
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,440
very it was like the epitome of a

1790
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,719
stressful environment so

1791
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,759
it's like it was good it was good in my

1792
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:55,319
mind when I saw what was happening I was

1793
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,539
like yeah [ __ ] let's just let's just

1794
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:59,519
test all these plants and then see like

1795
01:10:57,539 --> 01:11:03,238
the very the like the

1796
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,199
the various uh amount of PM resistance

1797
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:08,759
um

1798
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:10,859
and so yeah we were able to like uh to

1799
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,719
to like classify all the various cuts

1800
01:11:10,859 --> 01:11:14,698
that we were holding and uh you know

1801
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,980
figure out like what's the where the

1802
01:11:14,698 --> 01:11:19,678
upper echelon plants for PM resistance

1803
01:11:16,979 --> 01:11:22,559
like if you just let these plants go off

1804
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:25,140
anyways in the end

1805
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:28,620
there was a what our white email was

1806
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:30,560
completely PM resistant there's like so

1807
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:33,359
much PM in there like

1808
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:36,239
I was just like I was like so impressed

1809
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:38,939
I was like this this is like 100 PM

1810
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:41,819
resistance at least to the the like you

1811
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:43,439
know like powdery mildew um they have

1812
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:45,539
what's called races

1813
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:49,319
so if you look at the uh Washington

1814
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:50,819
State they have a hops powdery mildew uh

1815
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:53,039
breeding program

1816
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:56,099
and they've uh what they do in their

1817
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:57,300
breeding program is they have a culture

1818
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:00,179
up

1819
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:03,300
their various hop powdery mildew races

1820
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:05,760
so it's the same same uh subspecies of

1821
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,640
powdery mildew but various like

1822
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,640
ones that they've collect off various uh

1823
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,500
like the different hubs hubs cultivars

1824
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:17,280
and they um when they're breeding new

1825
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:19,738
hops they introduce all those six or

1826
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,420
however many races and they say okay

1827
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:23,639
yeah they can like

1828
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,640
classify those plants and say this one

1829
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,840
is resistant to race one two three and

1830
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,860
five

1831
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:35,520
um but not to six and four whatever but

1832
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:37,679
yeah this is uh this Whitey was uh like

1833
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,260
is like completely impervious I'm like

1834
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,520
damn this is [ __ ] crazy it's like I

1835
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,260
never would have I never would have

1836
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,699
figured that out if I didn't do that you

1837
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,020
know if we didn't do that

1838
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:49,319
that's cool

1839
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:52,560
Only the Strong Survive we sent uh that

1840
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:55,259
we sent uh like some stems of that to uh

1841
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,060
Kevin mckernan of medicinal genomics

1842
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:59,760
and he did a full

1843
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,420
uh genome

1844
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,119
um

1845
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:06,658
what do you call it genome scan uh

1846
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:08,399
sequence yeah genome sequence on it it's

1847
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:11,279
like plant

1848
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:13,920
number 48 of

1849
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:16,738
until you have its full uh genome

1850
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,359
sequence so that was kind of cool

1851
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:22,559
um and it's like public domain you can

1852
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:25,500
go look at it on the database he was

1853
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,179
part of a paper uh I believe like three

1854
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,380
years or four years ago now with the

1855
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:33,000
like the

1856
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:35,760
like it had 47 we were like just we just

1857
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,399
submitted just after that and he did a

1858
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,679
like he sent us the whole um

1859
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,779
the genetic like the heat map

1860
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:45,300
that showed um like all the different

1861
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:47,279
genes that they figured were linked to

1862
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,380
him and where

1863
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,719
the upregulating and downriggling was

1864
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:54,119
going on for the sweaty plant and it was

1865
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:56,100
like unrelated like you couldn't the

1866
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:59,039
patterns were different than what they

1867
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,679
had already as confirmed as PM resistant

1868
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:03,539
so he was a little bit skeptical or he

1869
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,158
was saying that um

1870
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:07,260
uh people

1871
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:09,719
like people were out like questioning

1872
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:11,820
him about you know the various people

1873
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:14,399
that submitted PM resistance

1874
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:17,279
premium resistant plants to that to like

1875
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,960
that um project

1876
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:21,000
um you know like what's the

1877
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,819
you know what's your uh standard you're

1878
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,960
like scientific like research uh grade

1879
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:30,539
uh standard setup you know like what's

1880
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,340
your control environment what's your

1881
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:34,859
criteria you know like

1882
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:36,420
like I I unfortunately I didn't take any

1883
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:37,679
pictures like I wish I would have had a

1884
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:39,000
bunch of pictures because I would have

1885
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:42,119
showed you know I would have been like

1886
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,859
enough but um so uh just because I

1887
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:46,500
didn't have any pictures

1888
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:48,839
uh it was it was just like he did like

1889
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,399
he didn't really he didn't really um I

1890
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:53,819
don't know if he believes uh it was like

1891
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:56,339
full APM resistance but but uh I assure

1892
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:58,619
you that plant was being resistant and

1893
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:01,619
still is it still exists

1894
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:03,599
well yeah so we made um we made uh f2s

1895
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:04,559
from those um we haven't like dipped

1896
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,020
into those

1897
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,360
um but we will at some point

1898
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:11,100
dip into those and apparently like we've

1899
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,539
sent those some of those out twos around

1900
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:14,340
and uh

1901
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:15,960
people said they're like really nice

1902
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:19,560
they make

1903
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:22,380
um nice fat they're kind of like uh

1904
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:26,640
the Whitey kind of reminds me of that uh

1905
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:29,760
South Florida OG Kush uh Style

1906
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:31,860
of thought but it's not like it's

1907
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,100
it's not really um

1908
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:36,839
no it doesn't have like a super strong

1909
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:40,079
flavor to it like a super

1910
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:43,980
like you don't go wow this is amazing

1911
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,960
but it works pretty well on hybrids

1912
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:47,639
um and it's it's kind of falls into one

1913
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,039
of those varieties that's kind of like

1914
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:53,579
uh submissive in crosses

1915
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:57,119
so it's like a good uh a good

1916
01:15:53,579 --> 01:15:59,880
a male for like crossing a bunch of

1917
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,679
stuff too without like dominating in the

1918
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,480
cross

1919
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,800
that's really interesting stuff it

1920
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:06,658
almost makes me think that like maybe

1921
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,960
with that Pam resistance stuff you just

1922
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:11,339
found a new mechanism through which it

1923
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,079
could be PM resistant you know it

1924
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:16,440
doesn't have to all come through the one

1925
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:17,819
sort of pathway but there you go that's

1926
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:19,019
cool have you ever seen it in any of The

1927
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:21,059
Offspring

1928
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:23,219
oh yeah we grew a bunch out

1929
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:25,199
yeah they're um The Offspring are

1930
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:26,219
perfectly like you get everything from

1931
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,799
the

1932
01:16:26,219 --> 01:16:30,960
the uh for PM resistance

1933
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,380
um you get everything from your target

1934
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,698
uh like plant to the the male like fpm

1935
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,779
resistance like

1936
01:16:35,698 --> 01:16:38,579
from

1937
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:41,279
the female

1938
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:43,738
you know Baseline to like 100 resistance

1939
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:46,319
like you get everything in there so yeah

1940
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:49,379
at some point it'd be nice to uh to be

1941
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:53,819
able to like follow that line and um a

1942
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:56,340
friend of ours uh Dr uh Philippe Henry

1943
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:57,899
he does a bunch he's done a [ __ ] ton of

1944
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,400
papers like you got to check him check

1945
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:00,599
him out like he's done some really cool

1946
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:04,198
stuff

1947
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:07,140
um he was uh he wanted to do uh

1948
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:08,219
like a test uh like a study on on the

1949
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,820
Whitey

1950
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:12,539
um

1951
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:15,299
using uh what's called a snip tip or a

1952
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:19,679
snip tip and this SNP chip a single

1953
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:22,199
nucleotide polymorphisms yeah yeah yeah

1954
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,239
um and he had uh

1955
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:28,259
like he has like uh

1956
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:29,939
a snip uh s p chip uh template that you

1957
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:32,579
want like that he I don't know like I

1958
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:35,519
haven't followed up on that but

1959
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:39,359
basically the idea would be to uh

1960
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:42,060
throw it those f2s and um

1961
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,920
like just do another similar situation

1962
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,179
where you just let the PM go all to hell

1963
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,699
and then you

1964
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:50,640
um take samples of everything like stuff

1965
01:17:47,698 --> 01:17:52,678
that's PM resistant and not PM resistant

1966
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,619
and everything in between and like and

1967
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:59,279
then try and drop all those onto it onto

1968
01:17:55,619 --> 01:18:01,619
one of those uh plates to get you know

1969
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:03,658
to see what the upgrade lighting and

1970
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:05,158
down regulating of all the genes is and

1971
01:18:03,658 --> 01:18:07,738
then

1972
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:10,079
like it personally I don't think I think

1973
01:18:07,738 --> 01:18:12,119
after you're going through all this I

1974
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:14,460
think the way that we selected like we

1975
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:17,460
found this PM resistant plant is

1976
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:18,899
the perfectly viable way to do it

1977
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:21,899
um like you can do all this stuff

1978
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:24,658
molecularly and and um

1979
01:18:21,899 --> 01:18:27,479
but I think like doing stuff like like

1980
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:29,519
doing what we did on the site is like

1981
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:31,259
Superior you know it's Superior in many

1982
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,820
ways because we're dealing with the real

1983
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:36,360
real world

1984
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:37,799
uh fun you know fungal and occulents of

1985
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:40,799
our environment

1986
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:43,619
that exists in our environment full-time

1987
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,900
yeah yeah like real what do they call it

1988
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:47,279
like real evolutionary pressure so to

1989
01:18:45,899 --> 01:18:49,319
speak but

1990
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:51,238
that's uh that's a wormhole we could

1991
01:18:49,319 --> 01:18:52,439
probably go down forever we've we've

1992
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:54,899
actually just got one last question

1993
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:57,839
before we do the quick five to wrap up

1994
01:18:54,899 --> 01:19:00,019
we had a listener who wanted to know if

1995
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,940
you knew anything about the origins of

1996
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:04,620
twixer

1997
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:06,719
twixer they said oh is it got something

1998
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:09,719
to do with butterscotch Hawaiian

1999
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,920
yep it's a butterscotch Hawaiian F1

2000
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:13,020
fennel

2001
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,460
that we isolated we grew it in um

2002
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:16,560
actually I was

2003
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,779
I was working with ganza wise in Quebec

2004
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,520
at that time Southern Quebec

2005
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:21,359
um so yeah we grilled some butter Scotch

2006
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:24,000
Hawaiian

2007
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,399
throughout 250 of those

2008
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,719
f1s and uh yeah it's one of the top

2009
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,000
Thanos

2010
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:33,000
the reason it's called twixer is because

2011
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,399
twixer is Canadian slang for 26 ounce

2012
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,100
bottle of booze

2013
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:39,839
and it was fennel number 26.

2014
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:42,480
I just thought it was like it kind of

2015
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,760
had a universal appeal like uh like

2016
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:46,439
it's just a common in Canada that's a

2017
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,300
common phrase from back in the day like

2018
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:50,698
go grab a twixer you know like pick up a

2019
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:52,500
twixer like yeah Twix or whatever it's

2020
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:55,639
just like a thing that everyone does you

2021
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,640
know we'll party

2022
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,960
um how about how about uh I give just a

2023
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,119
little rundown on on our like uh

2024
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,279
breeding slash I know selection process

2025
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:06,658
because we didn't really um cover that I

2026
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:09,000
mean we kind of covered it here and

2027
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:11,819
there but yeah sure now let's do it okay

2028
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,960
so um like what we like to do is we like

2029
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:15,359
to start off

2030
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,760
um let's say we're

2031
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:21,179
um we were growing something that we've

2032
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,619
that's from outside of our uh like seeds

2033
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:24,300
that we haven't made or grown before

2034
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:28,380
like something we bought and purchased

2035
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:31,140
or um traded for or been gifted

2036
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:33,480
um you know we'll grow um

2037
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:35,340
depending on how many seeds we have like

2038
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:37,619
if we have a limited amount if we have

2039
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:40,800
three packs for instance or four packs

2040
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:43,738
we grow those out

2041
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:46,260
um take like cuttings of everything

2042
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:48,299
um and just uh like

2043
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:50,400
like nowadays we like to just hold on to

2044
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:53,579
the males uh then flower out all the

2045
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,238
females uh smoke all the females

2046
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:56,460
um

2047
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,259
like try and classify them

2048
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,460
um select out the ones we like and then

2049
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:01,560
we'll do the

2050
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,539
take the cuttings of the males slaughter

2051
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,360
them out

2052
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:08,399
um and I try and do like a good smell

2053
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:10,439
evaluation and actually what we like to

2054
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,599
do what we've been doing for the past

2055
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:15,000
few years is when we go to transplant

2056
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:18,000
those male cuttings into uh to flower

2057
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,920
them out we like to smell the roots

2058
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,020
the roots of the males

2059
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,219
so not only do we smell the stems we

2060
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:25,440
smell the roots as well because the

2061
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:27,000
roots are actually if you get in there

2062
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:29,599
you'll smell there's some

2063
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,800
um there's some really like strong

2064
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,239
terpenes that are coming off the roots

2065
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,460
and they might not be like a perfect

2066
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:36,899
representation but

2067
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:39,960
um

2068
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:42,599
they just give you more information

2069
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,520
um like about the smells

2070
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,739
so yeah like with their Iraqi when we

2071
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:50,640
grew them out

2072
01:21:46,738 --> 01:21:52,439
um we uh we did when we went to put the

2073
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,780
females or the males in the flower we

2074
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:56,279
had uh you know we had like 30 males or

2075
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:57,960
whatever and uh

2076
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:01,738
so we just went through all the males

2077
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:04,319
and did like stem rubs and uh and um

2078
01:22:01,738 --> 01:22:06,419
root like smell it smelled all the roots

2079
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,219
and just chucked a bunch just because

2080
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,500
basically just smell the ones that are

2081
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:13,980
like a is a the loudest ones because

2082
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:16,439
that's like the old timer wisdom is

2083
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:18,479
just you don't mess don't mess around

2084
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:20,639
with males that don't aren't loud as

2085
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:23,339
[ __ ] that's like the old timer wisdom

2086
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:26,159
but and you know we'll be a little more

2087
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:28,860
sophisticated and we'll try and pair up

2088
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:31,500
males that um are similar to The the

2089
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:33,960
females that we prefer so

2090
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:36,359
um and yeah with flower out all those um

2091
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:39,420
we'll collect pollen from the males that

2092
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:40,920
we want and then we'll go take out

2093
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:43,079
pollen

2094
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:45,779
like go get our um this is all like

2095
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:47,880
ideal when we do in ideal circumstances

2096
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:49,738
like we're not obviously not able to do

2097
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,779
this all the time but it's just kind of

2098
01:22:49,738 --> 01:22:53,339
like the evolution of like how we're

2099
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:54,059
doing things and how we like to do

2100
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,500
things

2101
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,719
so yeah we'll

2102
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:00,300
we uh we'll collect a bunch of Pawn and

2103
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:02,399
like we've uh we have a

2104
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:04,440
vacuum column collector that we hook up

2105
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:07,500
to a vacuum cleaner that has like uh

2106
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:09,779
it's got like two screens on it so

2107
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:12,060
it's got a

2108
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:15,059
it's just like uh just some Plumbing

2109
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:16,500
stuff like Plumbing unions

2110
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,420
um I'll make a post about it on

2111
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,238
Instagram one day again

2112
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:23,940
um but yeah it's got uh paper filter

2113
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:27,178
disks to collect the pawn on that are

2114
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:28,500
like 25 we got like 25 micron holes or

2115
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:29,760
something but they'll collect all the

2116
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,100
pollen

2117
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,079
so we can like vacuum

2118
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:36,239
individual plants and collect that pawn

2119
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:39,119
onto paper disk and then take that disc

2120
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:41,519
and put it into uh

2121
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:45,000
into your like a little Tupperware

2122
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:47,820
containers with some silica uh

2123
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,279
desiccant beads color changing silica

2124
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:52,799
desiccant beads um

2125
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:54,420
and then just let the pollen dry out for

2126
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,739
like a week in there and then you can

2127
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,960
also see like

2128
01:23:55,738 --> 01:23:59,399
if the beads are changing color then you

2129
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,340
got to change them out to get all that

2130
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:05,219
moisture out of the pollen

2131
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:07,140
um and then um takes out Pawn back like

2132
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:09,480
put it in uh like make some little

2133
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:13,079
vacuum seal bags and like vacuum seal

2134
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:15,359
that stuff and uh like label it all

2135
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:17,640
stick it in the freezer

2136
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:19,738
um and trying to like before doing all

2137
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,320
that vacuum seal try and split it up

2138
01:24:19,738 --> 01:24:26,158
into so you have a bunch of different uh

2139
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:28,019
like mail number 17 will have like you

2140
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:30,238
know like three little pockets so that

2141
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:32,219
each time we open up the column there's

2142
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:34,019
enough to do a bunch of pollination and

2143
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:35,279
we don't have to worry about spoiling

2144
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:39,420
all upon we don't have to worry about

2145
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:42,599
opening up like exposing all the poems

2146
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:46,560
um to oxygen Etc

2147
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:48,960
um and then yeah make a bunch of seeds

2148
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,820
um and then grow out the seeds and do

2149
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,640
the whole thing over again

2150
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:57,539
out of curiosity how long have you been

2151
01:24:53,640 --> 01:25:00,659
able to store pollen for successfully

2152
01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:03,179
in the free in the freezer um

2153
01:25:00,658 --> 01:25:05,639
I don't know like I think you have to

2154
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:07,619
like I wanna at some point I want to uh

2155
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,199
do kind of a

2156
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:12,840
figure out with a pretty decent

2157
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:14,460
microscope when you desiccate the pollen

2158
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,079
I want to be able to look at it under a

2159
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,819
microscope and be able to tell when it's

2160
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:21,300
like look at it and see it's shrinking

2161
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:23,639
down because I think that's kind of like

2162
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:25,800
um be kind of interesting to see to try

2163
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:27,840
and optimize the carrying of the pollen

2164
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,400
to get it so that doesn't over you don't

2165
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,319
overdraw it

2166
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:33,779
um but like skunkman says you can keep

2167
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:36,779
on it'll keep her 10 years or something

2168
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:39,259
I don't know if like

2169
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:42,719
um is probably point zero one percent

2170
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:45,060
Vitality after after 10 years but if you

2171
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,279
got a billion pollen grains yeah you

2172
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:49,260
only need .01

2173
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:51,599
um wow but in the fridge it's only like

2174
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:54,480
uh it's only like six months to a year

2175
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,920
in my experience in the fridge

2176
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:58,379
um and you got to be really good about

2177
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,300
like making sure there's desiccant and

2178
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:02,420
with in with your pollen in the fridge

2179
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,800
because it's a moisture environment

2180
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,480
yeah certainly I've heard that I I've

2181
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,579
heard people struggling with any more

2182
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,059
than say six to 12 months

2183
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:13,139
yeah yeah definitely

2184
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:15,659
interesting and how do you go about

2185
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:18,000
doing your testing of strains how many

2186
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:19,979
seeds do you pop what size pots do you

2187
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,960
grow them out in is there a standard

2188
01:26:19,979 --> 01:26:23,399
protocol or just sort of whatever fits

2189
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:26,340
at the time

2190
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:29,819
uh well we try to grow

2191
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:32,159
at least one pack for testing in-house

2192
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:34,198
um but ideally like two packs because

2193
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,960
then yeah it's just a little better

2194
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:40,379
sample size

2195
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,840
um and then just uh just start them like

2196
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,340
I just tend to start them in little like

2197
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,260
little cells and then just go through

2198
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:48,480
like a bottom

2199
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:50,039
to like number one product number two

2200
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:51,178
pot

2201
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:54,179
um and then

2202
01:26:51,179 --> 01:26:55,859
it all depends like how much veg time we

2203
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:58,199
have until the next cup like till the

2204
01:26:55,859 --> 01:27:00,420
next room is available so it's like kind

2205
01:26:58,198 --> 01:27:02,759
of variable but minimum we'll grow them

2206
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:04,139
first for to six weeks before popping

2207
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,300
them in flour

2208
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:08,279
um this is kind of what you want to do

2209
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:11,340
anyways you want to get them let them

2210
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:12,300
get a sexually mature

2211
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:14,520
um

2212
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:18,719
and then yeah just generally blowing

2213
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:20,639
them out in five gallons and up

2214
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:24,658
five or ten gallons usually in like

2215
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:27,719
geopods in the organic mix with water

2216
01:27:24,658 --> 01:27:29,339
yeah lots of water and then um if we see

2217
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:30,840
it like we're looking for the major

2218
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,100
things we're looking for when we do

2219
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,860
testing is

2220
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:36,179
number one is is this a plant where it's

2221
01:27:34,859 --> 01:27:37,738
growing or is this like a seed line

2222
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:39,359
we're throwing is there gonna like

2223
01:27:37,738 --> 01:27:40,799
people grow a pack or they're gonna find

2224
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,839
something worth throwing at least one

2225
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,300
plant that's like worth keeping

2226
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,579
and uh the other thing is like is there

2227
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:49,079
like if we grow do we find more than one

2228
01:27:47,579 --> 01:27:51,179
intersex plan

2229
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:54,179
one intersex plant is you know because

2230
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:56,520
we deal with a lot of sativa stuff is

2231
01:27:54,179 --> 01:27:58,079
um I would consider it acceptable you

2232
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,900
know if it's like one intersex out of

2233
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:02,460
two packs maybe you know

2234
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:04,019
um but if we get more than that then

2235
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:05,760
it's like okay yeah

2236
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,719
gotta you know it's like you know that's

2237
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,820
too much

2238
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,439
but generally we don't actually like we

2239
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:12,420
don't see a lot of intersects in most of

2240
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:14,759
our stuff like surprisingly it just kind

2241
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,179
of blows my yeah

2242
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:19,739
um so our males you know our male like

2243
01:28:17,179 --> 01:28:21,899
when we evaluate males one of the things

2244
01:28:19,738 --> 01:28:24,718
we do is we just like to keep the mail

2245
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:26,219
around in like beds for years you know

2246
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,020
keep it in beds for like a year or two

2247
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:30,179
years because

2248
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:31,739
um you can see a lot you can learn a lot

2249
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,819
about the male despite keeping it around

2250
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:34,500
and

2251
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:36,359
um throwing it into flower you know

2252
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,520
flowering them off occasionally yeah and

2253
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:40,380
just checking for like uh because even

2254
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:43,020
after a year they'll start spitting out

2255
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:44,579
pistols like they'll be like oh they

2256
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:46,320
just like start for some reason they

2257
01:28:44,579 --> 01:28:48,960
just get you know they'll get stressed

2258
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:50,579
out after year because we you know we

2259
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,980
like to evaluate

2260
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:54,840
a wood plants do in Clone form you know

2261
01:28:52,979 --> 01:28:56,759
more so than what they do in seed form

2262
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,619
because uh you know ultimately most

2263
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,539
people are growing from clone

2264
01:28:58,619 --> 01:29:01,920
not most people but

2265
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:04,500
a lot of people

2266
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,279
definitely robust conditions there for

2267
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,920
sure

2268
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:10,198
on to our final five questions for the

2269
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,239
episodes I guess it will maybe probably

2270
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:15,238
need to get separate answers for each of

2271
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:18,779
these but first one being what is the

2272
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:21,238
best or most memorable cannabis smoke or

2273
01:29:18,779 --> 01:29:23,460
experience you've ever had

2274
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:25,319
oh my God

2275
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:28,619
I'll tell you when I'm I was making

2276
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:31,079
brownies out of like guys maybe like uh

2277
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:32,698
21 or 22 I was making some brownies out

2278
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:35,000
of some sativa Bud that and I wasn't

2279
01:29:32,698 --> 01:29:38,399
really familiar with sativa at that time

2280
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,399
and uh I'd done LSD a few times before

2281
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:43,500
that and uh yeah I ate enough butter

2282
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:46,198
that I was having a full out LSD

2283
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:49,079
experience off of cannabis so yeah

2284
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:51,000
memorable for sure

2285
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,800
yeah I had I actually had a similar

2286
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,100
experience where I was making this one

2287
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,340
uh summer I made a bunch of weed granola

2288
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:02,400
and I just uh

2289
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:03,779
I just I got a little carried away uh

2290
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,238
eating it and I was thinking yeah this

2291
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:07,920
thing's all right and I'm thinking I

2292
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:09,658
wonder how much of this stuff I can eat

2293
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,579
before like you know like what's the

2294
01:30:09,658 --> 01:30:13,138
maximum amount and I ate a bunch of that

2295
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:16,340
I like

2296
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:19,260
I was high for a solid 24 hours

2297
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:21,119
I remember I remember like at one point

2298
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,100
I was just like spinning out of control

2299
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:24,840
but I mean that's not I mean that's not

2300
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,739
like super profound or anything and I

2301
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,139
was just like

2302
01:30:25,738 --> 01:30:30,799
what happens in when you eat too much

2303
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:33,300
THC as a younger person

2304
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,400
but like um

2305
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:38,100
as far as like

2306
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:41,638
what was uh oh memorable [ __ ] would be

2307
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:45,300
like Vancouver and like around the like

2308
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:47,159
around that 2000s era like getting high

2309
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:49,139
down there with some of the people that

2310
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:51,719
would come into town and stuff there's

2311
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:54,300
lots of really good memories that was a

2312
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:56,100
really special era in that time what was

2313
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:59,279
going on there at cannabis culture with

2314
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:01,560
Greg Williams and Mark Emery and yeah

2315
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,679
lots of really good memories of like

2316
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:08,159
fighting fighting Bird right

2317
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:10,020
but as far as like profound smoking he's

2318
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,059
thinking of like like 420 it brings to

2319
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:14,280
mind you know just like uh being around

2320
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:16,260
a lot of people and uh but what's up

2321
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:18,119
like with I think maybe the question is

2322
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:21,179
what's the weed you smoke that [ __ ]

2323
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:23,399
popular top everything

2324
01:31:21,179 --> 01:31:26,520
there you go definitely interesting

2325
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:30,059
memories right there and if we go to the

2326
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:32,460
other end of the spectrum what is the

2327
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,360
most disappointing experience in terms

2328
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,639
of

2329
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:37,979
something where like your friends had

2330
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:41,699
hyped it up everyone's really keen on it

2331
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:44,939
you tried it and you're like is that it

2332
01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:46,799
oh this one time I grew um some Cali

2333
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:49,379
orange that I got from every seed

2334
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,420
company and like we were I I was just

2335
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,380
this is when I was new to the scene and

2336
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:54,119
um

2337
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:55,679
it was just one of the streams I was

2338
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:57,479
going around so we just thought it was

2339
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,579
the best [ __ ] ever

2340
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:02,339
um because it was growing commercially

2341
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:05,279
um anyways so I grew some of this uh

2342
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:07,800
Kelly orange and uh yeah my grabbed a

2343
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:09,920
butt and my my roommate rolled some up

2344
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:12,060
and we like rolled up the biggest body

2345
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,399
we smoked it

2346
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:16,920
and they looked at each other like no

2347
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:19,799
effect like what the hell is going on

2348
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:22,440
here but in retrospect I was probably a

2349
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,360
high CBD fennel like that you know it's

2350
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:27,299
probably some you know I had the same

2351
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:29,519
experience with that I was like uh yeah

2352
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:31,619
as but maybe you're thinking of like

2353
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,540
what's the what's the variety of weed

2354
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:35,519
that was hyped up so high and then you

2355
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:38,819
went to smoke it and then cookies is one

2356
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,960
for me yeah where you're like oh this is

2357
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:44,539
all it is

2358
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:48,060
oh you talking for him yeah

2359
01:32:44,539 --> 01:32:49,859
please kind of gets old fast like if

2360
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:52,020
you're smoking at Birth yeah it's like

2361
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:53,759
that three-day smoke you know you smoke

2362
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:55,560
it more than three days and it's no good

2363
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,619
right oh is it for the tolerance you're

2364
01:32:55,560 --> 01:33:00,360
thinking yeah what about uh East Coast

2365
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:03,000
Charities or what do you think of that I

2366
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:04,859
put it in a similar category yeah it's

2367
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,439
it's it's got a really like super

2368
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:09,539
pronounced uh flavor and like really

2369
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,698
strong flavor it's got a nice flavor it

2370
01:33:09,539 --> 01:33:13,500
comes out really well in the oil yeah

2371
01:33:11,698 --> 01:33:16,979
but um

2372
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:19,698
the highest uh just not it's not very

2373
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:19,698
like uh

2374
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:26,099
like a sophistically interesting yeah I

2375
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,840
was going to say sophisticated but

2376
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,060
that's not the word like uh yeah it's

2377
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,340
kind of boring it's kind of yeah and it

2378
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:33,960
just seems to like it's fairly easy to

2379
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:36,840
build a tolerance too

2380
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:39,239
the the East Coast surveys like it's

2381
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:41,880
nice to have like some other weed when

2382
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:44,879
you have that stuff in my like my

2383
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,940
experience great so the next question we

2384
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,980
have is a fun one I'm gonna drop you off

2385
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:51,779
on a desert island for the rest of your

2386
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:54,000
life where you can grow as much weight

2387
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:55,800
as you want but you can only take three

2388
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,020
strains with you they can either be

2389
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,880
cuttings or seed lines if you're

2390
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:01,199
confident and you like nah bring on

2391
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,600
males

2392
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:04,919
um what three things am I gonna leave

2393
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,960
you with

2394
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:08,819
oh [ __ ] well definitely got to be a

2395
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,579
Colombian in there yeah it definitely

2396
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:16,139
has to be Colombian for sure I'd have to

2397
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:16,139
have a tie and probably some Afghani

2398
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:26,339
yeah yeah there you go Colombian tie

2399
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:28,799
Afghan or Pakistani maybe instead

2400
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:30,779
but yeah like like seed lines are the

2401
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,699
bunch of variation in them like you know

2402
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:34,139
like a nice Colombian with the more the

2403
01:34:32,698 --> 01:34:36,719
better yeah it was like

2404
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:40,380
each bag would have like 10 000 seeds in

2405
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:42,260
it yeah yeah for sure

2406
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:45,420
um so on the other end of the spectrum

2407
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:48,659
you're gonna drop someone else off onto

2408
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:50,100
the island someone you're not a fan of

2409
01:34:48,658 --> 01:34:52,138
what are you what are you gonna leave

2410
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:54,780
them with

2411
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:58,100
oh some low rider for sure [ __ ] low

2412
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:58,099
rider definitely yeah

2413
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:03,119
something with a lot of intersection oh

2414
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:04,760
a lot of intersex yeah but it's like it

2415
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:07,260
would be like a hamstring

2416
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:09,659
by the time you finally grew it out you

2417
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:11,940
realize oh [ __ ] it's got no THC in that

2418
01:35:09,658 --> 01:35:13,920
what the heck or it's like really sneaky

2419
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:16,259
intersex it's like hidden right at the

2420
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,460
very bottom Leaf underneath or the

2421
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:22,260
center of each button yeah yeah

2422
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:24,260
that's great that's great all right on

2423
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:27,420
to the final question for our interview

2424
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:30,980
if you had a time machine and you can go

2425
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:34,380
back to any place any point in history

2426
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:36,899
to presumably collect either some seeds

2427
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:39,480
or a cutting where would you go and what

2428
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:40,979
are you collecting

2429
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:44,698
ooh

2430
01:35:40,979 --> 01:35:46,738
uh pre uh Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

2431
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:49,198
all through there in that hashmaking

2432
01:35:46,738 --> 01:35:49,799
area that would be super fun

2433
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:52,198
um

2434
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:55,619
and maybe what about going back to like

2435
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:57,719
like 100 million years oh yeah and going

2436
01:35:55,619 --> 01:36:00,179
can we go to like the planet Syria to

2437
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:04,139
like serious beasts or serious B Star

2438
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:06,000
yeah I think I'd go to we'll go to the

2439
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:08,460
like the series like when they were

2440
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,460
loading the the spaceships up with

2441
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:13,679
cannabis to send to to the Earth let's

2442
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:15,539
go there and then we could like smoke

2443
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:18,380
all that stuff and like pre-select it

2444
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:21,179
before it went to Earth

2445
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:23,699
what's this all about dude cannabis was
