00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:12,870
hello welcome to the next episode of the

2
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:15,808
podcast the cannabis podcast for budding

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:17,339
enthusiasts it's great to be back after

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,689
a short break and we hope we didn't

5
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,390
leave you all with too much withdraws

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,060
his show as always was brought to you by

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:29,310
420 Australia n OG s organic garden

8
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:30,598
solutions in this episode we're joined

9
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:32,579
by one of the most controversial figures

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:45,000
in the industry the man himself man

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:46,739
right here we go thanks for having me so

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,509
the first question I like to ask people

13
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:49,769
is let's go back to the start you know

14
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,619
what was your first experience with

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,140
cannabis my first experience with

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,439
cannabis my dad was a grower and a

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,789
smuggler and a dealer of all kinds of

18
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:04,859
different wonderful drugs when I was

19
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,599
young so I mean one of the first smells

20
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,409
I remember smelling was cannabis and

21
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,239
that that's how far I went back you know

22
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,219
I was able to water for him when I was

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,929
little and really at during those years

24
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,408
I had no interest in it it was a

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,790
terrible chore in there as they got

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,659
older of course the interest grew a lot

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,009
more when I started smoking and so what

28
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,400
was the first strain you remember

29
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,530
smoking Oh God you know we didn't really

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,680
have names for strains back then so it's

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,090
just like skunk bud you know that's

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,450
pretty much what they called it all of

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,640
it sometimes they call it like red hair

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,579
or orange hair which really didn't mean

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,469
anything yeah it just happened to have

36
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:47,789
more orange or more red hair

37
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,429
maybe that's pretty much the only names

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,229
that they ever called any of it yeah

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,880
okay and do you think that any of that

40
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,759
stuff you would like consider working

41
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,709
now some of that glorious Oh God

42
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,019
you know I mean a lot of its gonna be

43
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,548
the Mexican stuff baby's very little

44
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,349
Colombian at that time because I was I

45
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,030
was too young to really hit the

46
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,459
Colombian era so a lot of it was gonna

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,530
be a lot of the really shitty shittily

48
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,930
grown very moldy Mexican stuff they were

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,919
pushing through Arizona in California so

50
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,050
probably not

51
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,139
not a whole lot of wonderful things

52
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,670
coming through there and so before you

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,229
got into breeding yourself

54
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,449
were there ever any breeders you were

55
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,310
kind of looking up toward was it more of

56
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,199
just like a natural progression to do it

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,439
yourself

58
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:35,039
mm-hmm see Ingemar who created my

59
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,419
Twitter of course that was a big strain

60
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,859
when I was young you know that was one

61
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,359
of the first name strains that we heard

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,450
about other than Alaskan Thunder [ __ ]

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,459
Matanuska Valley Thunder from up of

64
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,979
course blueberry with DJ short the name

65
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:52,050
was well-known and a lot of the stuff

66
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:56,429
Neville shown maker did the you know was

67
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,750
it like the in all five Big Bud a lot of

68
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,400
that stuff was very big around that time

69
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,909
as well so those were some of the bigger

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,800
names around the time yeah and so how do

71
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,120
you fill those genetics stand up to some

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,939
of the ones today you know it's like a

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,789
contested topic whether you know older

74
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,319
stuff was better than now um you know

75
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:14,909
like you could still go back to a lot of

76
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,099
those old Norton like lipase lines and

77
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,739
there's people like tera ho they'll work

78
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,299
those now and it's still the same same

79
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,069
lines that are available back then and

80
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,689
they're still just as dank as anything

81
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,159
we're putting out now it's just you know

82
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,930
as with anything there's a large

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,030
phenotypic selection they need to go on

84
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,110
and it takes a little art election to go

85
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,449
through all that stuff and there's a lot

86
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,920
of phenotypes and I mean back then

87
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,539
people weren't doing these massive

88
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,169
selections like they can do now you know

89
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:42,239
the space was so much more limited but

90
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,309
ya understand the test of time there's

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,489
so many that still do it's just a matter

92
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,530
of what people prefer a lot of what

93
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:54,500
people prefer now is the visual look of

94
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:57,239
like the hard you know dense nugs and

95
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,879
that that wasn't what it looked like as

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,420
much back then you still had a lot of

97
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,579
the sativa Airy buds yeah yeah I've

98
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,048
noticed that that real swollen Brack to

99
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,719
kind of look from like that cookies

100
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:13,909
house is very popular yeah especially

101
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:16,649
out here yeah do you find that um

102
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:18,149
essentially do kind of subscribe to that

103
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,339
idea that some people have that those

104
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,560
older genetics were you know some of the

105
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,079
best and we've watered them down in a

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,030
sense or more just taken in a different

107
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,120
but equal direction

108
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:32,099
I'd say you know I mean even if you look

109
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,288
at the THC values they've actually

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,449
increased over all the years so I mean

111
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:37,978
in that sense that if you just look at

112
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,150
the THC percentage and a lot of people

113
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,250
subscribe to that being the most

114
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,779
important factor with with cannabis if

115
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,910
you if you believe that way which I

116
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,429
don't personally then yeah we've

117
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,069
increased and made everything better but

118
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,900
I mean just through selection alone I

119
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,080
mean even if people aren't breeders

120
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,179
they're gonna keep picking the best just

121
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,579
as a whole the ratio is gonna keep going

122
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,240
up as far as what the best is and I

123
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:07,439
think today we have a wider selection a

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,300
more diverse selection of really amazing

125
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,639
stuff you know it's not just the one or

126
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,250
two skunk types you know yeah okay so I

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,538
mean if we go back a bit now like some

128
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,759
of the earliest information I could find

129
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:23,009
on you as a breeder was you being a part

130
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,639
of that small crew the modern militia

131
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,590
with lumper and the blazers and haze man

132
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,269
how did have come about and like I was a

133
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:33,959
bit of a follow up what led to the

134
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,399
breakdown of that well I wasn't really

135
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,519
in the militia crew it's just friends

136
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,929
with all of them like live but it was a

137
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,598
good friend he still is

138
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,110
Mona's a good friend he was Hays man

139
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:50,430
made a lot of the gear for Mona the

140
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,569
breakdown I mean I would stay probably

141
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,120
stepping on toes saying it but I mean

142
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,680
motive retires three times a year so I

143
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,629
think that's kind of what happened

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
people were just like oh man like he's

145
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,709
gonna retire no you know and like some

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,879
people start going away and then you

147
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,339
know he's back a few months later he

148
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,699
then comes back and retires so you know

149
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:11,060
I mean more power power to him

150
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,949
and so I guess in that hidden retired

151
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,718
yeah I mean you still he's still around

152
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:20,009
so he's still who's still do this thing

153
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:21,110
still making cool [ __ ] so but yeah that

154
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,020
a lot of those guys are still around

155
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,520
yeah so I guess you know d-did you kind

156
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,198
of start out on your own from the

157
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,718
beginning or were you kind of teamed up

158
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,009
with someone to begin with what when I

159
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:34,978
first started like getting into serious

160
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:37,020
breeding my mentor was a guy named James

161
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,449
Hogg Gonzalez who made the original hogs

162
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,359
breath out of San Diego and he taught me

163
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,879
a lot of what was going

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,280
with breeding in and all the work he had

165
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,870
done with the hast breath and I got to

166
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,029
work on lines with him we released a few

167
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,560
seed lines and then he passed away so

168
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,478
that was my first real experience

169
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,110
working with real treat her hands-on and

170
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,449
releasing lines we also had the san

171
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,180
diego river growers society which was

172
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:03,908
basically a collective there was 32 of

173
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,668
us at one point and we would basically

174
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:10,209
grow we could arm our own money into it

175
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:11,589
we grow only for giving weed away to

176
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,060
cancer internally ill patients

177
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:15,189
there was no it wasn't like a collective

178
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,750
where we give them to a cheap or

179
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:18,218
whatever you know the cost came out of

180
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,269
our pockets and we did it just because

181
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:21,250
there was no other collective in San

182
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:23,620
Diego doing it and it was it was just it

183
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,399
was a curried crab for a lot of people

184
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,879
and we wanted to push against that yeah

185
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,508
okay

186
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,680
and so was that kind of what drawed you

187
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:34,330
to breeding initially were you trying to

188
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,288
develop better strains that collective

189
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:39,459
or was that like gonna track the first

190
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:42,158
thing that initially tried to get me to

191
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,870
breed or let me down that path was my

192
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:46,750
best friend's mom had pancreatic cancer

193
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,129
and she kind of raised me and during

194
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,509
that time I saw the only thing that was

195
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,860
giving her her dignity back to be able

196
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,930
to get out of bed even like come have

197
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,210
dinner with us was being able to smoke

198
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,400
and only some huge strains would work

199
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,778
and it was hit or miss all the time so

200
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,008
during that time was when I really

201
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,718
really got heavily into it when she was

202
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,930
still alive and she she only lived about

203
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:07,810
eight months with that and I just kept

204
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,360
going from then on out and and then came

205
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,478
the the San Diego Society came out of

206
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,620
that you volved out of that kinda okay

207
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:16,598
yeah that makes sense

208
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,370
and so were you initially just

209
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:20,228
interested in regular seeds or was

210
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,459
feminized seeds always something on your

211
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:24,699
mind seeing is that something you are

212
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:27,579
fairly well known for um you know back

213
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,379
then it didn't matter to me because I

214
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,818
had already learned really early on how

215
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,399
to reverse plant so it didn't matter to

216
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,229
me whether I had a male or a female

217
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,299
I can always refer a female and make a

218
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,339
line so it's either/or

219
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,958
um there's a lot of stigma between our

220
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,300
back then about breeding with feminized

221
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,189
seeds but looking at the science even

222
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,859
back then it was just like I realized oh

223
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,060
this is like old wives tale like these

224
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,980
people don't understand the science

225
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,299
behind it and they're just gonna keep

226
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,460
repeating the same ol [ __ ] until they

227
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,409
understand it so

228
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,470
yeah I've always been pretty open to

229
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:00,539
breeding with both yeah so I mean if we

230
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,460
want to get into the kind of biology of

231
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,289
all that do you believe [ __ ] you know

232
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,629
pollen produced from a feminized plant

233
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,769
is different on the genetic level from

234
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:12,360
pollen from just a straight

235
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:13,919
hermaphrodite plant yes yeah maybe not

236
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,459
so much on a genetic level because all

237
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,110
cannabis is is a dual sex plant I mean

238
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,449
all of it is it's just how much it

239
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,389
expresses it how much of the how much of

240
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,629
the hormones are activated in the plant

241
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:30,419
now we need a reversal plant using like

242
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:33,240
silver thiosulfate which is what most of

243
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,799
us use you're tricking the plant

244
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,470
not necessarily into thinking it's

245
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,679
stressed but but to releasing more

246
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,660
healthy

247
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,889
it's halting Jabril and I remember

248
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,309
correctly no it's bringing in jibrell

249
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:49,860
and halting uh ethylene production which

250
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:53,609
is the gas ethylene and by doing that

251
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,830
it's it's making the plant or more male

252
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,810
characteristics less female and it's not

253
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,730
causing us any stress to the plant but

254
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:01,109
when you're when you're hermaphrodite in

255
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,759
a plant you're actually bringing that

256
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,980
stress into it and you're pushing the

257
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,350
stress on into its progeny to the seeds

258
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,539
so that I mean that's the difference and

259
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,009
you know people say that you know all

260
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:12,809
feminized seeds are more bound to her

261
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:14,250
and that's not necessarily correct

262
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:18,179
there's a lot of plants that you cannot

263
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,350
stress and pushed to her mistress but

264
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,969
you can do it using the silver

265
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,440
thiosulfate method because it's not a

266
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,970
stress method yeah so that sounds really

267
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,800
similar to what I have always kind of

268
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,009
theorized has happened but just kind of

269
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,689
clarify a week ago saying that you know

270
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:36,149
you know in a stressed hermaphroditic

271
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,040
plant there the stress causes say maybe

272
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,110
some epigenetic changes or something

273
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,699
which are then put into the pollen and

274
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,528
passed on whereas the thiosulfate

275
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,070
doesn't do that and therefore it yes

276
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:48,360
yeah yeah okay great yeah so what was

277
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,470
the first feminized crossed you ever

278
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,649
made or tried to make oh god that's a

279
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,269
good question um you see I think one of

280
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,789
the first ones was either green crack or

281
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,230
blue tree making an s-1 line of one of

282
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,789
the two it was really early on when I

283
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,899
did the green crack and it was still I

284
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:05,129
think was right around the same time I

285
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,199
did the blue tree I just don't remember

286
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:08,669
which came first

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,129
yes I mean this will be another good

288
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:14,009
question blue dream very very hot line

289
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,750
to be asked wond do you think that the

290
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,220
the variation in quality because I've

291
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,629
seen some really good blue dreams and

292
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,149
some horrible blue gems from different

293
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:24,210
breeders do you think the surance is the

294
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,939
cutting they're used or is a good fabric

295
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,590
taking several stages well you know a

296
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,150
good feminized product project is always

297
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,950
going to take several stages but I mean

298
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,689
most people don't ever get that to do

299
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,270
more than one stage because people want

300
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,530
it now they want it now and if you try

301
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,049
to work on it for too long then they

302
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:42,389
lose interest and maybe maybe the line

303
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:45,209
isn't as popular you know in next season

304
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,649
and it becomes worthless you know as far

305
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,030
as making seeds and spending your time

306
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,309
doing that so a lot of them don't ever

307
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:51,990
get worked more than one generation but

308
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,669
with blue dream there's a specific cut

309
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,009
from santa cruz but it's called the SC

310
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:57,959
cut the santa cruz cut and that one to

311
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,759
me who's been like the supreme blue

312
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,790
dream that's the one that for a long

313
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,720
time everybody in San Diego was growing

314
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,769
everyone up north and santa cruz you're

315
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,279
growing and that's where its reputation

316
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:10,949
came from as being like this amazing

317
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,779
almost connoisseur level a massive

318
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,350
yielder with tons of resin production

319
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:20,339
and a really like very light light light

320
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,960
blueberry smell with a nice like hmm had

321
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,960
like a Thai uplifting happy high as

322
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,030
opposed to a speedy haze high but a lot

323
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,769
of the other and pretty much any blue

324
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,329
haze out there now like a blueberry haze

325
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:32,460
cross people are calm blue dream and

326
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,530
there's a lot of shitty blue haze

327
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,500
crosses this haze it's not like the most

328
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:39,120
amazing line to breed with yeah okay

329
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,620
interesting opinion there we'll get into

330
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,330
that in a moment but yeah a follow up

331
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,370
question is do you think that a lot of

332
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,830
the you know shittier cuts of blue dream

333
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,179
I'm abs ones from the Santa Cruz or do

334
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,100
you think just they're just various

335
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,539
people have made it because it's an

336
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,310
interesting point you brought up where I

337
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,110
don't think blue dream was made by one

338
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:58,079
person I think many people have made

339
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,639
that cross and you know that yeah who

340
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,620
said what do you mean there's there's

341
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,059
Johnny Blaze that was another line

342
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,799
released by legend seed line that was

343
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,479
also another blueberry haze but

344
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,199
blueberry haze has been being made by

345
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,810
hundreds of people over decades now so I

346
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,580
mean I think it's just a popular name

347
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:16,109
with anything that has blueberry in it

348
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,180
or a blueberry smell that yields well

349
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,860
and I think that like in California the

350
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,979
name change game is so stupid it's been

351
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,419
going on for so long

352
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,490
people just don't give a [ __ ] what they

353
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:26,948
pass out or what they call it flung sand

354
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,720
cells you know yeah and I think that was

355
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:30,789
the major the major impetus behind all

356
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,680
these [ __ ] up blue dream crosses when

357
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:34,179
we did the blue dream reversal almost

358
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,309
they weren't I wouldn't say they were a

359
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:38,229
perfectly uniform or IBL or anything but

360
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:41,429
they were they were really good I mean

361
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,449
all the phenotypes were fairly

362
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:45,069
predictable and they definitely

363
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,099
resembled the mom quite a bit you could

364
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:52,870
only see a good resemblance to the mall

365
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:55,028
so yeah yeah okay and so I mean the

366
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,500
thing which stands out to me above most

367
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:58,028
every other person I've been to do these

368
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,528
music seems to be such an influential

369
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:01,328
part of your life you know are they

370
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:03,578
almost mutually exclusive creating a

371
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:08,500
music or it is one kind of inspire the

372
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:09,969
other or I you know for me you know

373
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,828
musically flips my life a lot I was in

374
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,230
band since I was 12 and like playing

375
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:17,379
shows punk rock shows and being the punk

376
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,269
rock scene and it is just a wild time in

377
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,269
California to be alive and in that it

378
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,470
was crazy it wasn't like you know the

379
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,209
era of Green Day where everything was

380
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,790
safe you know kids could get dropped off

381
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:29,259
downtown and it was fun and no like you

382
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:30,490
if you went to punk shows you knew we

383
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,659
gonna get a fight it was gonna be

384
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,299
[ __ ] terrifying

385
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:35,919
you know so growing up in that kind of

386
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:39,068
the scene is it's hard not to let it

387
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,129
influence your life you know yeah musics

388
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:44,948
always been a big part of my life and

389
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:46,750
it's just somehow ran straight head into

390
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:48,729
this this the whole attitude that I had

391
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,409
in the music scene into this because

392
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,269
there's a lot of nasty people in our

393
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:53,469
scene and our cannabis scene and I just

394
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:55,870
I've met them all

395
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,379
I've met all of them headfirst and it

396
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,419
sucks I'm like a magnet to him so you

397
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,458
just have to take that bull I don't give

398
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:07,419
a [ __ ] [ __ ] you you don't like it you

399
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:10,809
know they just work hand in hand yeah so

400
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:14,769
how did right suit start then it was

401
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:16,119
after the project with James hog and you

402
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:17,649
know we had started talking about doing

403
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,028
right seed stuff I had already started

404
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,429
working on the clock work order strain

405
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:22,659
and he had sold a bunch of those he's

406
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,068
like dude these are selling really well

407
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:25,838
the work we did you know why don't you

408
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:26,948
start doing some of that and we had

409
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,329
already worked on the clock record

410
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:30,399
straight a bit and we were passing it

411
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,539
out in San Diego to the Cancer

412
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,028
internally ill patients that actually

413
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:34,809
wanted to grow for themselves and that's

414
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:36,429
just kind of working

415
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,489
to be you know I just started like okay

416
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:40,778
well I need a name well my bad my my

417

always Matt riot so right seats make

419
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,990
sense and just started from there

420
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:49,840
but the Clockwork Orange and then spread

421
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,970
on out so like a lot of people including

422
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,500
myself are interested to hear what's the

423
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,930
real history behind the Clockwork Orange

424
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,730
you know it seems to be really it's a

425
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:00,338
here and there online but there's never

426
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,870
the full story yeah it kind of sucks cuz

427
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:03,700
I've told the story a bunch but every

428
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,560
time I go look it up or I see it

429
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,940
somewhere it looks like all jumbled you

430
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:11,859
know so there was a dude named it just

431
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,390
calm crazy dog like that nobody called

432
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,750
him that but me just cuz he was [ __ ]

433
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,120
crazy

434
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,649
his name was Doug he was this weird dude

435
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,080
that lived out in the hills of San Diego

436
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,939
Houston he had this big massive house

437
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,080
left to him by his parents and the whole

438
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,390
thing was a girl I'm talking his

439
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,690
bathrooms every [ __ ] room his

440
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,789
basements out so outdoors and he trained

441
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,650
drug dogs for the cops which was even

442
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,599
more weird like these germ evil German

443
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,459
Shepherd dogs he'd speak to him in

444
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,680
German and trained to be drug dogs for

445
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,440
cops well this dude was also a Tweaker

446
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,029
and like I mean he had syringes

447
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,790
everywhere like he was out of his

448
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:48,220
[ __ ] mind anyway I met this guy

449
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:50,349
through I think Craigslist or something

450
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,850
at the time that was going on and he

451
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,230
wanted to trade clones with me I was

452
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,310
like okay cool yeah I'll come visit you

453
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,560
I had no idea what I was getting

454
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:59,469
headfirst into so I went out there I met

455
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:03,519
him and he was just an interesting dude

456
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,720
very weird and he showed me this really

457
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,309
really weird plant that had all these

458
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,588
krinkle mutations he's like yeah man I

459
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,659
got this from Amsterdam this came it

460
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:12,549
came from a bag of Alaskan ice now

461
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,079
Alaskan ice at the time was not a

462
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,059
greenhouse strain it was something they

463
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,409
were selling at the coffee shop as bud

464
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,740
but there wasn't anything that they had

465
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,660
named a strain yet and the genetics

466
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,230
obviously looked the haahoos really

467
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,730
sativa the leaves were more narrow early

468
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,880
in veg and then later in veg that got

469
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,440
really wide blade drug type like almost

470
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,230
looking Afghani but I had this weird

471
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,390
crinkle to it and he's like yeah man

472
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,009
this is this is this is as strong as the

473
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,470
hash from the parents and I was like ok

474
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:44,710
cool I'll take that cut so I took it

475
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,900
around with it and we started working

476
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,950
the line and I was trying to take take

477
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,580
the crinkle out of it

478
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,808
because it just

479
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:51,189
look so weird I was like how people are

480
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:53,019
not gonna be into this if we can get the

481
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,370
high and the and the smell and the taste

482
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,419
that would be great but we need to get

483
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:58,298
rid of this crinkle because people think

484
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:01,149
it's ugly every time we took a step a

485
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:03,398
step away breeding the crinkle out the

486
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:05,349
the the potency was gone and just kept

487
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:06,819
creeping away from it but every time we

488
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:10,480
do have the phenotype with a crinkle pop

489
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:13,178
up it was back so I ended up taking that

490
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,370
and just having to go basically work

491
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:17,798
backwards from there and trying to

492
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:19,839
remake that original clone that I had

493
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,460
for him and then when we found that that

494
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,599
original clone or the closest

495
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,970
resemblance to that original clone

496
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,469
that's what became Clockwork Orange but

497
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,750
nobody knows what it really is I mean

498
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,548
since Alaskan ice wasn't a real strain

499
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,528
at the time there wasn't a white widow

500
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:36,579
haze there's it's not it's not a white

501
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:40,148
widow it's it's got Afghani some sort of

502
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:43,240
skunk definitely has some A's in it but

503
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:46,558
to what degree of each and what actual

504
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,419
strains are in it no I have no clue okay

505
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,579
that confirm do you breed with the

506
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:54,250
original Cotto with the backcross I

507
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:56,048
think you said you may the original

508
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,480
mother cut that was the the crinkle cut

509
00:18:56,048 --> 00:19:00,190
that was used to make the lines that we

510
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,690
use to pick the clockwork orange' mom

511
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,759
out of okay fantastic yeah and so or any

512
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,639
other of those lines being used to breed

513
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,528
with currently or just the the other one

514
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:14,319
every once in a while will bust out we

515
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:16,480
made the very first line of s ones of

516
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,058
the Clockwork Orange cut we made a line

517
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,220
called smart alecks and basically that

518
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:23,950
was like this really super coffee it

519
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,990
just smelled like when you open a fresh

520
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,759
thing of Folgers coffee and smell it it

521
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,388
smells just like that it was crazy and

522
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:33,638
uh it was more dense than clockwork it

523
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:35,138
was less resinous but more dense and it

524
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:36,308
still had a really good potency to it

525
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:37,689
then that wouldn't be came down as the

526
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:41,829
smart alecks and sometimes we use that

527
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,538
cut or s ones of it you know it's been

528
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:45,879
hard to keep these alive for a long long

529
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:47,769
time they're really really hard plants

530
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,940
to grow and anybody that asked me for

531
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,159
the cut when they finally get out of

532
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,899
like dude just just remember this is a

533
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,889
really hard plant to grow it's not gonna

534
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:55,359
respond to you well and usually

535
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:56,379
everybody gets so mad at if they'll

536
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,168
throw it out eventually

537
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,880
so it's kept its rarity because of that

538
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,080
it's just really hard to grow it took me

539
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,480
a long time to master

540
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,849
okay and so is there any reason why you

541
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,259
choose not to have the S ones

542
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:10,730
continually and stuff like is it

543
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:14,180
something you want to keep kind of a bit

544
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,860
more elusive or you know it's just hard

545
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,720
to do it's it's a it when it whenever

546
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:20,509
verse it it doesn't produce much pollen

547
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:24,380
I need to reverse a whole room of it to

548
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:25,640
do it and people complain about the

549
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,340
prices of it and I get that it's

550
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,650
expensive so it's like I look at the

551
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:32,179
price that I have to to charge to make

552
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,670
it worth doing a whole room of that and

553
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,440
getting you know only four hundred seeds

554
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,700
something like that whereas if I do a

555
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,009
whole room of something like a regular

556
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,350
line with a regular mail thousands and

557
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:43,700
thousands of seeds so it's just I try to

558
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,839
only do it every once in a while to

559
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,299
where people still have that interest

560
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,500
willing to pay that because if I flooded

561
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:51,460
the market with it and try charging the

562
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,079
same price if it just it'd be pointless

563
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,360
yes I mean you kind of brought up an

564
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,579
interesting topic people have kind of

565
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:00,529
long criticized your pricing however

566
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:02,779
nowadays we see the rise of several

567
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:05,410
breeders who routinely charge as much or

568
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:08,599
more than yours most notably aficionado

569
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,310
that feel pricing plays into the market

570
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,409
you know do you think it's simply supply

571
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,349
and demand or is it just haters looking

572
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,790
for any excuse well I mean the way we

573
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:19,309
priced everything it's way we've always

574
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:21,589
done it is on it really it was on supply

575
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:22,940
and demand and and popularity if it's

576
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:25,369
something like a lot of people wanted

577
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,740
and we had a hundred seeds of it then

578
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,909
you know I usually said make you make an

579
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,200
offer because that's all that's there

580
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,820
and that's what that's what we have you

581
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,309
know and that kind of determined a lot

582
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:35,509
of the prices I caught a lot of [ __ ] for

583
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:35,960
it but there's a few reasons for doing

584
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,230
it one

585
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,579
I don't mmm it's the same reason I don't

586
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:45,970
use these test triggers I I don't like

587
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:48,289
necessarily want a bunch of new growers

588
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,870
trying to run really hard to grow beer

589
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:53,690
all that causes is problems always

590
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:55,789
causes problems new growers want you

591
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,519
know tend to not all of them but a good

592
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:59,869
amount of them they want to make up for

593
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,519
their skill by getting a strain they

594
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:02,329
think will just be super dank and of

595
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,180
course everything is going to grow

596
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:08,899
itself and by having the prices I did it

597
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:11,120
kept them away and and and it kept the

598
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,230
rarity up and for the most part most of

599
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,229
the people that buy I for me are

600
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:17,179
breeders they aren't new growers so

601
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,798
you know I see a lot of insults online

602
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,330
but I also sell seats for fifty bucks a

603
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,279
pack on down to thirty bucks a pack it's

604
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:25,819
just the ones they tend to want are the

605
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,609
ones that are the cheapest yeah

606
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:30,918
interesting and so do you feel that seed

607
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:33,379
gonna continually increase in price

608
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,030
because I mean there's seeds that are

609
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,799
currently going in like instagram

610
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:38,660
auctions for thousands of dollars

611
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,009
routinely do you think this is a trend

612
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,500
that will just continue or do you think

613
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:44,240
it'll cap out somewhere it depends how

614
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,069
stupid the market is if they're I mean a

615
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,200
lot of this [ __ ] selling for a lot of

616
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:50,359
money is [ __ ] [ __ ] like oh yeah

617
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,950
the efficient audio stuff like I mean

618
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,539
jeans made some cool [ __ ] but 99% of

619
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,860
that like I'm looking at the genetics it

620
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,509
was talking about their og cush line

621
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:58,609
bean of Pakistani lemon Thai whatever

622
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,079
like just the typical line of what

623
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:01,819
people think oh gee cush is and that's

624
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,869
not correct so obviously guys haven't

625
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:06,139
done their [ __ ] homework and they're

626
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:07,699
charging an assload for it but but as

627
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,980
long as the market remains stupid and

628
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,450
ignorant to what is what then sure I

629
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,789
mean if there's sky's the limit on how

630
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:17,080
much they'll pay and so what do you

631
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:20,000
think is the real origins of OG pushed

632
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:23,178
not that I mean it's it's an Afghani

633
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,230
sort of plant it's stretchy but that

634
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:28,669
doesn't necessarily mean it couldn't be

635
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,589
all indica I you know it has a lot of

636
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:32,270
the tied traits so that have the

637
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:36,529
happiness of the hive but it's obviously

638
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:38,179
got the density of a Afghani so it could

639
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,829
be something around there but who knows

640
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:41,330
really who knows I've never heard so

641
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:43,220
many [ __ ] stories that well that

642
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:45,349
could make sense and then it all ends up

643
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,429
being [ __ ] so I quit trying to

644
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:50,839
figure it out a long time ago okay

645
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:53,360
digging through your Instagram I noticed

646
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:55,159
that you received a cutting of Skelly

647
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,569
which is a strain that's popped up on

648
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,950
this show before because it was around

649
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,319
during the time or a little bit before

650
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,048
if the dog bud what's your I know I'm

651
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,990
Skelly god it's a great plant yeah and

652
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:09,349
uh I had heard of it first before from

653
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,450
JJ in New York several years ago and it

654
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:13,119
was called the puck I guess the guy who

655
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,830
used to sell it used to put it in like a

656
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,928
like almost like a bubble tape I don't

657
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,909
know it's an American thing it's like a

658
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:21,500
bubble gum case there was round like a

659
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,650
disc like almost like a hockey puck and

660
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,569
here like a Copenhagen PAC puck looking

661
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,159
thing and he would sell it in those so

662
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:29,059
that that that nickname stuck with it as

663
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,350
well

664
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,440
that the Skelly hash bun is just like a

665
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:35,000
really dank stinky Afghani plant it's

666
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,289
really really good though it's very

667
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,869
that's what that's one of those ones

668
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:42,259
that definitely stood the test of time

669
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:44,389
for daintiness yeah sure and so another

670
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,519
thing I found in Instagram is whenever

671
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,080
bubblegum comes out you're always sure

672
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,089
to make sure that people know you're not

673
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:53,599
referring to the Indiana bubblegum what

674
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,529
stood behind all of this you know we

675
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,969
made it

676
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:57,649
I usually didn't point it out too much

677
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,350
we made the original bubblegum cookies

678
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:03,320
line and ever since I've made that I've

679
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:05,419
had [ __ ] cookie fam knock it off say

680
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:06,950
it was this and that you know I haven't

681
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,390
there's another guy in Instagram I think

682
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,610
he calls himself like bubblegum cookie

683
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,720
man or something yeah and he's taking

684
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,179
credit for it saying yeah this is the

685
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,710
Indiana and it's not it's it's been like

686
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,360
the Indiana bubblegum doesn't pass on a

687
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,340
lot of pink bubblegum traits they're

688
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,009
slight they're in the in the cut but it

689
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:23,689
is not by any means you know something

690
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:24,170
you could smell and go hmm pink

691
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,500
bubblegum

692
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,720
that's [ __ ] sweet you know well the

693
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,309
cutting we had was from the original

694
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,900
1995 since he Starline we had the seed

695
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,049
line that was originally released as a

696
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,850
regular line by 1996 it was cut back to

697
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:39,079
a feminized line and the regular seeds

698
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:41,179
were very hard to find but we've had we

699
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,460
have had a bunch of them we have to them

700
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,680
and we kept a large stock of them so we

701
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,569
could go through them in there there's

702
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,240
one phenotype that is like a menthol

703
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:52,009
pink bubblegum line and it's an amazing

704
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,529
breeder and it passes on that really

705
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:57,589
super pink bubblegum smell and taste and

706
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,930
that's what we used in the line so like

707
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,189
I mean people what they just assume like

708
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,360
you know if they want to say this is

709
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,640
their line they're assuming that the

710
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,809
idiot above gum was in it and it's just

711
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,060
kind of frustrating there's none of one

712
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:09,859
of those things or it's like what the

713
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:11,359
indiana bubble gum line is and how it

714
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,339
breeds you you've never say that in a

715
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,219
million years that's what it was but

716
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:21,470
it's just yeah again people making just

717
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:24,769
stupid claims getting used to it so in

718
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:26,600
that same kind of vein most of your

719
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:29,480
releases like you just mentioned with

720
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,829
the bubble gum cookies they they don't

721
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,329
seem to be like they're gonna be

722
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:34,129
restocked for sure and you know like a

723
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:35,240
lot of your strains into you need to

724
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,950
treat them as though they're possibly

725
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,569
one offs is that how you view them all

726
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,380
yeah do you make a lot of lines with the

727
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:44,000
intention of restocking them

728
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,649
ever make any line with intention

729
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,480
restocking meliss are special you know

730
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:49,609
we do a lot of our testing in-house I

731
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,470
don't use testers because 99% of the

732
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:53,629
time they don't know what they're doing

733
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:57,140
to even begin to test anything and they

734
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,000
really don't even growth traitor but so

735
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,500
we stopped using testers we do all our

736
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,898
testing in the house we watch everything

737
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,859
ourselves you know it runs through all

738
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:06,528
the fee knows we're getting we see what

739
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:08,359
we have and we know we're offering a lot

740
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:09,319
of the lines unless they're really

741
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,819
really good

742
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,668
I usually don't bring them back bubble

743
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:17,898
gum cookies we did a version two of I'm

744
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:19,490
just a second generation of it a cookie

745
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:21,979
berry which is probably one of our most

746
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,620
knocked off lines it's going around

747
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,909
Californian clonise blue cookies and all

748
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,579
kinds of [ __ ] and that's another one

749
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:31,340
cookie fans taking credit for we've

750
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:34,339
released another version of that using

751
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:36,439
ogk B instead of the form cut but I

752
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:38,388
actually do prefer the forum cut cross

753
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,548
which is the original one to the version

754
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:42,849
ii version so when we do it again we'll

755
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:47,450
probably go back to the original cross

756
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:49,189
and so do you like to specifically list

757
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:53,090
what generations are being used for your

758
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:55,340
projects like oh yeah yeah so like in a

759
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:57,470
parent I've noticed I mean maybe I'm

760
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:58,759
wrong here but do you always list you

761
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,470
know that like this is and you know

762
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,589
let's just say with the I forget the

763
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,058
name of the strain you mentioned earlier

764
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:07,009
what was it there that particular s one

765
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,869
of the clockwork orange' the lazy Ben

766
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:13,158
was the smart alecks smart aleck smart

767
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:15,349
aleck I was so the smart alecks you know

768
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,778
you would you like to write like smart

769
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:19,638
alecks brackets clockwork orange' s1 or

770
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:23,409
is it just smart alecks cuz sometimes I

771
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:26,418
guess there's more work it's a new list

772
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:27,860
yeah it's usually like with smart alecks

773
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:30,710
in that case it'll smart alecks in

774
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:32,990
parentheses clockwork orange' s1 yeah

775
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:37,700
okay awesome so people can like kind of

776
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:39,079
trust what yeah pretty specific when I

777
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,370
excited cuz if I would be the same way

778
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,808
like I want to know exactly what I'm

779
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:44,028
getting and you know what's in there

780
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:45,918
I would hope everybody else would too so

781
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:48,319
I try to be pretty pretty damn specific

782
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,179
is it and so when you're braiding

783
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,569
regular projects like regular sex

784
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:54,180
projects not feminized

785
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:56,399
the numbers you'd ideally like to use

786
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:01,560
for such a project in terms of finding

787
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:05,790
parents or testing progeny for a wrote

788
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:08,909
the line we went through eight years of

789
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:10,950
different Afghani lines and and Super

790
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,180
Skunk lines looking I mean I can't even

791
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,100
count the number of seeds it

792
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,500
astronomical but eight years of

793
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:18,419
constantly every run cracking more and

794
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,519
more Afghani seeds and super-stoked

795
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,370
lines to try to find the roadkill line

796
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,509
and that that was an ideal you know run

797
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:25,529
on something that was one of our best

798
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:29,640
ones and it's been one of the most

799
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:31,589
successful and so then regular regular

800
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,240
seed lines I mean like it just depends

801
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:34,649
on what you have to work with but the

802
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,140
one thing that I always I would make a

803
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,759
habit of before I go do any runs for any

804
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,110
lines if I only have a pack of something

805
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,690
I'm gonna f2 it and run through those

806
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:45,659
lines so I have you know a multitude of

807
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:48,660
seeds to look through yeah okay

808
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,430
and so like um in the case of the

809
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,529
roadkill skunk which is something gets

810
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,850
brought up in almost every episode

811
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:56,279
you've got several lines which feature

812
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:57,359
you know roadkill skunk traits or from

813
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,940
the roadkill afghani

814
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,369
yeah how would you describe this line

815
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,470
you know to you is it a replica or just

816
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,789
a homage something similar like where do

817
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,940
you rate it in comparison to the

818
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:11,460
original roadkill style well the

819
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,259
original Roca skunk was not a sunk one

820
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,519
line it was just an Afghani that

821
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,890
happened to smell like a skunk and

822
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,720
people called it skunk but that often

823
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,250
gets confused and confabulate with skunk

824
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,110
number one that was released by saying

825
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,509
I'm the skunk man yeah you know and then

826
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:26,069
after taken to Amsterdam and it which is

827
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:26,759
like there's a lot of phenotypes that

828
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:28,950
are sweet

829
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,769
there's citrus there's all kinds of [ __ ]

830
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,690
but you don't get is straight-up skunk

831
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:36,680
spray like like an American skunk spray

832
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:39,750
you know being run over in the road and

833
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,340
like our roadkill is like that but it

834
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,319
also has another trait that's really

835
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,250
strong old Afghan ease which is burn

836
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:49,109
rubber like a burnt rubber tennis ball

837
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:51,390
yeah and then there's some slight

838
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:55,129
ammonia to it too which is often

839
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:58,800
described as like an acrid and taste

840
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:01,590
okay and so which of those crosses you

841
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,649
feel is the most representative of the

842
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:08,869
roadkill skunk then I

843
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:11,100
think the Custis our dub which in itself

844
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:13,039
considering what's out there what's been

845
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:15,839
out there is already a pretty skunk line

846
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,109
which is why we chose that we did a

847
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:22,619
reversed cross with the the Afghan Imam

848
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:23,969
that had the most roadkill traits and we

849
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,099
released that as road kill Afghani

850
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:28,650
feminized and then we used a male health

851
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,509
from the pure Afghani line that we found

852
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,480
the roadkill mom in they had the same

853
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:36,210
exact type traits and terms when we

854
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,240
reversed him so we had to test him out

855
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:42,569
first by reversing him using etheral and

856
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,370
florell so we got to see what kind of

857
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:47,759
terpenes he put out well ahead of time

858
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:49,979
before we used any of the males okay and

859
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,559
that was our regular seed line of it and

860
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,170
is that that's the process way you you

861
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,490
reverse the male and get like female sex

862
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,950
plants like you know pods and stuff is

863
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,779
that right yeah it's I mean you don't

864
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,279
get like full-on like you're not gonna

865
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,539
get like a female with thick ass buds

866
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,609
and stuff but you will see a lot more

867
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:07,230
resin production you're gonna see some

868
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:09,449
flowers and you'll get a better idea of

869
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,980
what terpenes he produces and I mean

870
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,269
even if he produces those terpenes it

871
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,819
doesn't necessarily mean he's gonna pass

872
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:17,160
them on so you at least get the first

873
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:18,480
idea of what's going on and then you

874
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,360
have to use him to see if the traits get

875
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,950
passed on reliably yeah okay and so is

876
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,569
that a process you like to do for all

877
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,539
regular mouths or just the you know the

878
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:29,069
long processes it's something I've been

879
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,779
doing more and more often it's a really

880
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:33,389
valuable tool that was really overlooked

881
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,889
for a long time and now it's becoming

882
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,240
more and more popular I think I've been

883
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,740
talking about it for a few years and I'm

884
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,569
slowly noticing more and more people

885
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,099
doing it and I think that's a good thing

886
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:43,589
because all I can do is advance breeding

887
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:47,669
for everyone making a trip selection

888
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:49,649
easier okay and so what are some of the

889
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,000
traits you look for in a male when

890
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,509
you're just flowering it out leap

891
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,009
serration structure things like that you

892
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:59,009
know back in the day I used to look for

893
00:32:56,009 --> 00:33:00,839
I mean really it is a a shot in the dark

894
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:03,599
the first the first round with a male

895
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,859
and early on I used to look for a male

896
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,869
that was the most like a female

897
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:08,159
something that I had that like I was

898
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:09,629
sure was gonna be a female when I was

899
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,310
looking at it you know and right before

900
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,080
it showed any sex and it's like okay I

901
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:14,460
don't have to you know keep an eye too

902
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,559
bad on this one this is obviously a

903
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,370
female you know that's what I would look

904
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,470
for but as time

905
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:22,028
I realized you know that was still 50/50

906
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,319
that was still here miss like you didn't

907
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:26,950
always work and I'd have to throw out

908
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:29,079
whole lines that I made so really we

909
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,400
just keep all of our males and we just

910
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:32,918
try to find something that has a

911
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,450
structure that we like one that produces

912
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,580
resin naturally on its own without

913
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,960
having to be reversed we cross them and

914
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:39,819
then we see how he does and that's just

915
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,179
it's a long-ass process but that's the

916
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:45,819
only reliable way to do it yeah okay

917
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:48,190
and so I mean you touched on it oh yeah

918
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:49,629
in terms of the Clockwork Orange only

919
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,308
producing a small number of seeds for

920
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,679
the whole room to be done when you're

921
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:55,329
producing a female pollen is that

922
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,950
something which just comes down to the

923
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:58,449
individual cut as to how well it

924
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,370
responds to that or is it really like a

925
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,110
methodology based process where like the

926
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:03,538
better you are at it the more pollen

927
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:06,069
you'll get and things like that

928
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:09,878
pollen collection is hard with reversals

929
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:11,889
in the first place but man it goes down

930
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:13,598
to the exact plant it goes down to the

931
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,950
environment the plants and every every

932
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,838
last little variable matters with it

933
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:19,148
some plants reverse better than others

934
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:20,878
some really suck in it a lot but really

935
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:23,588
dense indicas are really hard to reverse

936
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:26,500
just because the the male the male

937
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:28,599
clusters the the male parts they cluster

938
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,179
up and get really hard and they're hard

939
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,889
to pick out I mean they don't just burst

940
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:36,668
like a regular mouth the nuts don't hang

941
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,960
so to speak so that's that's something

942
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:39,309
that happens a lot with really dense

943
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,710
indicas so a lot of people like

944
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:48,250
reversing more less-dense sativas yeah

945
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:51,369
okay and so do you think being out there

946
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:54,398
a lot of pollen from such strains would

947
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:56,530
just come down to training the plant to

948
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,630
maybe have very few bud sites and so

949
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,380
that you could do it or it's just still

950
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,430
still more like intricate than that

951
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,800
there's actually certain chemicals you

952
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:07,719
can use to make the the clusters be less

953
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,950
dense so we've I've had someone else

954
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,500
help me with that and kind of figure out

955
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:13,239
that aspect of it and it was it's been

956
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,608
so helpful in that part because that was

957
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:17,139
always the main problem with reversing a

958
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:20,108
lot of like the og pushes and stuff like

959
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:22,618
that and never getting enough seeds it

960
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:25,869
was just that dense formation of

961
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,070
clustered balls and me trying to pull

962
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,539
the pollen how you literally have to go

963
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,550
in with tweezers and do it by hand and

964
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:31,710
shake it into a bag each little cluster

965
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,269
and

966
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,949
now we have another chemical that'll

967
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:36,599
stretch it out make them hang a little

968
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:38,848
bit more and it's much easier to collect

969
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,320
so I mean even over time it's getting

970
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,440
easier for us to do more developing

971
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,780
better methods every every year yeah and

972
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,519
so what what strain has been the best

973
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,730
one to reverse in your opinion your

974
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,170
favorite like to work with Bubba just

975
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,690
the old bubble Kirsch like for some

976
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,670
reason even though it has dense but

977
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,550
formations it's always been really

978
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,380
reliable it's always kicked out a lot of

979
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,240
pollen it's just always been really

980
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,190
reliable and really easy to use and and

981
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,419
and it tends to have amazing progeny

982
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,420
I've never really had a bad bubble

983
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,740
reversal or bad Bubba crosses yeah

984
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,780
that's interesting because bob is a

985
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:13,979
strain I personally love a lot what do

986
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,900
you think the history on it is you know

987
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,780
a lot of people say max Abba made it

988
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,900
what do you think what do you you know I

989
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,830
like matte bubble a lot he's got some

990
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,930
valid stuff he said with oceans with

991
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:30,449
sorry some just felt he's got a valid

992
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:32,039
point with the with og cush I mean he's

993
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:34,079
got a lot of documentation with his

994
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,269
friend Josh being one of the original

995
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,309
guys that were passing it around however

996
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:41,250
Bubba he was seeing I think came around

997
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:43,250
96 but you can go to a High Times

998
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:48,150
Magazine in 94 and see Bubba in it

999
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:50,280
so it's hard to say I mean I know that

1000
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,410
the the Oregon Afghani tends to look a

1001
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,410
lot probably closest above as a mom for

1002
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:58,889
Bubba some people say West Coast dog I

1003
00:36:55,409 --> 00:37:01,348
don't know it's obviously an Afghani of

1004
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:04,108
some sort yeah that's interesting

1005
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:06,480
because I am I spoke to Professor P of

1006
00:37:04,108 --> 00:37:10,338
dynasty and he he thinks that the Oregon

1007
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,780
Afghani is maybe an S one of Bubba

1008
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:14,369
yeah and that could be that could be

1009
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,269
he's worked with it a lot more than I

1010
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:18,480
have that's for sure

1011
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:19,769
you would know yeah okay so I mean the

1012
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
West Coast dog is another thing you

1013
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,309
brought up that's interesting seed find

1014
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,019
it has quite a long-winded story about

1015
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,670
you know contrary to the Matt Barber

1016
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:28,259
story explaining how they think that's

1017
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,430
the Bob wood you had put any credit to

1018
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,619
that oh do you think it's all just kind

1019
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:32,969
of Chinese whispers yeah you know the

1020
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,280
West Coast dog gained a lot of

1021
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:37,289
popularity with the guy a group of guys

1022
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,280
called the brothel brothers and they

1023
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:42,869
were some conman [ __ ] and they've

1024
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,420
had like a few different names that

1025
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:46,890
they've used over the years they've used

1026
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,519
trichome kings and screwed over a bunch

1027
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:53,548
of people on that CRS seeds yes those

1028
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:55,409
guys ciara seeds brothel brothers

1029
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:56,940
they've used all those names and it

1030
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:59,699
seems to be that the West Coast dog

1031
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,818
originates with those guys the story the

1032
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,318
strain everything comes from those guys

1033
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:07,019
and so what's it like to you though do

1034
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:09,179
you see any traits of the buffer in it

1035
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:12,980
um yeah you know I would say I would

1036
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:17,098
probably guess if anything it's like a

1037
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:20,730
Bubba hybrid with some sort of narrow

1038
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:23,640
leaf sativa type plant okay interesting

1039
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:26,849
something something fruity keeping on

1040
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:28,558
the topic of history I saw in a I think

1041
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:29,849
it was either an Instagram post on a

1042
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,710
forum some way you were dropping some

1043
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,088
knowledge about dr. Grinspoon and the

1044
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,280
origin oh yeah

1045
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:38,039
it's a very hotly contested strain you

1046
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,510
know what do you know about it um the

1047
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,909
first time I heard about that strain it

1048
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,980
was called quays it from delta nine sent

1049
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:47,068
it to me and it was just a clone only

1050
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,230
strain I don't think much was known

1051
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:50,670
about its its history other than it

1052
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,679
probably was a Southeast Asian of some

1053
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,420
sort so whether it was Thai philippi

1054
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,358
know there's something from Southeast

1055
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,588
Asia and that that clone that like a lot

1056
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,199
of the pictures will see on the sensi

1057
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:02,639
seeds site if you look in the quays

1058
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,259
clone only that's what the pictures were

1059
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:09,118
of and Barney's farm got a cut of it

1060
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:12,390
reversed it sold it his doctor Grinspoon

1061
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,670
that was it yeah interesting because

1062
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:17,578
online on that same seed find a website

1063
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,909
they say that it's a reef immense strain

1064
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:23,099
I forget the name of oh good lord

1065
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:25,618
yeah guess it's know that it was the

1066
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:31,769
Oregon Utah across to something but

1067
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:35,400
anyway permits a [ __ ] idiot I know me

1068
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:36,690
and yeah sorry me and devil we're

1069
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,910
working together for a little bit Nevel

1070
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,159
show and maker and reefer man somehow

1071
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,899
got in the middle of it and started

1072
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,399
getting Neville to try to send me or me

1073
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,490
to try to send cuts to him through

1074
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,510
Neville and you know like I daren't he'd

1075
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:49,858
already [ __ ] over so many of my

1076
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,359
friends in America and I was like you

1077
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:53,159
know you probably don't want to talk to

1078
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,358
this guy and I really want to send him

1079
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:58,588
anything he's kind of a piece of [ __ ]

1080
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,380
and Neville insisted Nick no man I say

1081
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:00,519
he's good so you

1082
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,320
you're my friend you'll send in this

1083
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:04,509
[ __ ] so what's he do he [ __ ] me over

1084
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,970
there too but you know he's notorious

1085
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,680
for that he's just a scumbag ex white

1086
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:11,409
power Nazi guy that just kind of hides

1087
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:14,199
out being a piece of [ __ ] it makes his

1088
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,579
resurgence every now and then he makes a

1089
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,869
lot of claims himself I don't know if

1090
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,389
she'd find her made that claim he made

1091
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:22,539
that claim but either way it's incorrect

1092
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:25,119
definitely incorrect okay and so I mean

1093
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:26,980
you've been working with the what you

1094
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,900
say is the original Girl Scout cookie

1095
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,699
claim for a while what is the original

1096
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,750
Girl Scout cookie client cuz even cookie

1097
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:36,369
fam can't really tell you yeah before

1098
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,139
the forum cut was called the forum cut

1099
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:41,230
it was just Girl Scout cookies and that

1100
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:42,940
was it that's it everybody must argue

1101
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,110
over it that just did that's that was

1102
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,929
the first one that's being passed around

1103
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,160
as Girl Scout cookies and as more people

1104
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:49,839
got their hands on it they started

1105
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,339
calling the forum cut to try to say oh

1106
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,360
well that one's not as cool as this one

1107
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:59,289
we have over here you know yeah okay and

1108
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:01,300
so do you think that like most of the

1109
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:03,610
other cuts are s ones from the forum cut

1110
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,050
or other seeds that the form cut

1111
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:08,140
originally came from like that same

1112
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,970
batch or well I mean you can get like a

1113
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:12,730
forum cut type plant from reversing

1114
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:14,559
cherry pie Kush so I mean if they could

1115
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,409
be more s1 to cherry pie cush they could

1116
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,599
be s1 to the forum they could also be

1117
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:22,690
Oracle og hybrids because that kicks out

1118
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,420
the same exact type of phenotypes so god

1119
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,550
only knows I see the most common being

1120
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:32,260
the og KB type coming out of Oracle and

1121
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:33,820
og hybrids so I mean yeah okay and I

1122
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,350
mean one of the reasons why we're on

1123
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,570
this topic is because one of your new

1124
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:40,929
strains coming out is the f1 Durban

1125
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,700
cross dosey doe yes what inspired this

1126
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:45,699
and how did you get access to the

1127
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:47,769
elusive f1 durbin now that strains been

1128
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:50,409
going around for [ __ ] ever it's just

1129
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:52,960
always been known as Mendo Durban it

1130
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:55,960
looks a lot like cherry pie the original

1131
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,789
you know it was never that rare it's

1132
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,889
just only been rare since they've called

1133
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:01,960
it f1 dirt or whatever but it's been

1134
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:04,299
around forever it's it's not even a pure

1135
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,940
Durban in any sense of the word this is

1136
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:10,240
very indica Dom which a real pure Durban

1137
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:12,769
is very sativa Dom it has a little bit

1138
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:16,949
of that a nice like

1139
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:20,190
it's called a black licorice to it not

1140
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:22,829
much just ant yeah that clones been

1141
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:25,019
around forever okay and so what do you

1142
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:26,849
think God the the real origins of the

1143
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:29,070
ghost gets you hinted before the cherry

1144
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,659
pie this one maybe yeah I mean you can

1145
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,609
make like it we can make Girl Scout

1146
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:35,579
cookies out of okie any a really old

1147
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:36,750
over to you like Lucas headband or San

1148
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,639
Fernando Valley the real San Fernando

1149
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,070
Valley cut or face off any of those you

1150
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,839
can use and cross to the old Orkut and

1151
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,160
you'll get all that say you I mean

1152
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,420
there's a lot of phenotypes that come

1153
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,000
out of that cross but you will see

1154
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,369
cookies type phenotypes I mean not just

1155
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,440
those two strings now F one herb might

1156
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:55,289
be in it as they call it know them ended

1157
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,880
urban because Cherry Pie does look a lot

1158
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:58,469
like them in a turban and it could just

1159
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,450
be the Cherry Pie as the you know the

1160
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:02,989
like a granddaddy purple which is also

1161
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:06,179
an Urkel phenotype or Oracle out cross

1162
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:07,439
it could be GDP EOG and that and that

1163
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:10,409
would make sense I mean you could

1164
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,840
potentially pull that out of that that's

1165
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:15,539
that's the best if I got on that okay

1166
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,130
and so I mean your work kind of in

1167
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:18,690
contrast to a lot of other breeders is

1168
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,210
you clearly don't seem to have a problem

1169
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,679
breeding with cookies what do you feel

1170
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,260
on this never happened you know do you

1171
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,419
do you dislike kind of the hate that

1172
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,920
cookies gets or you don't mind you know

1173
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,240
covered by how do you feel about it or

1174
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,820
given you know you do bring with it a

1175
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,039
lot you know I I was the first one to

1176
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:38,519
release it to any seeds of it any of any

1177
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,619
strains of it and see and that was a

1178
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:42,900
long time ago a long time ago that's

1179
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,600
like what five six years ago now I saw

1180
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,099
I'd give a [ __ ] anymore I mean what I

1181
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,150
was doing it no one else was using it

1182
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,130
nobody really wanted to buy it because

1183
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,389
nobody knew what it was and by the time

1184
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,730
I sold out of it that's when people

1185
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:55,559
started getting popular so I missed that

1186
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,820
whole cookies way for the most part I

1187
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:57,960
mean I'll use it every now and then now

1188
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:01,400
but it's definitely not like a main

1189
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,019
staple of anything I do I mean it's good

1190
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,019
it has its place it's not that potent I

1191
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:08,670
mean the og KB types are and they're out

1192
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:14,039
crosses are but that particular one

1193
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:15,510
wasn't yeah okay and so I don't know if

1194
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:18,840
you're aware but there's currently like

1195
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,950
a bit of an ongoing discussion maybe

1196
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,390
slightly aggressive

1197
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:25,980
between gauge green and cookie fam kind

1198
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:27,599
of over the origins of the cookies you

1199
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,440
gage Green is saying that they believe

1200
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,940
that the Cherry Pie cush is the parent

1201
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,220
of the ODE of the cookies and it's

1202
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,230
probably s ones of that have you seen

1203
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:38,339
any of this at all / you know how how do

1204
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,809
you think about that have you ever seen

1205
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:45,289
the bush uh you know I don't

1206
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:49,380
as far as gage spring goes that's pretty

1207
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:51,779
that's a pretty everybody knows that I

1208
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,369
hate that [ __ ] it's not

1209
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,890
specifically the all the guys in it but

1210
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:56,970
the original guy he goes by key play he

1211
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:59,279
was the first one to use the name gage

1212
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:00,868
bringing he lied and cheated his way

1213
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,880
through all of our business he did it to

1214
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:05,640
me limp a guy named old man a bunch of

1215
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,230
people and he's made his whole his whole

1216
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,460
campaign on just stabbing everyone in

1217
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,608
the back that helped him out along the

1218
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,280
way

1219
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:12,420
even Jojo Rizzo who is supposed to be

1220
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,390
one of his friends that he's named

1221
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,730
strain zapped after he traded him heroin

1222
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:18,210
for his seat stock I mean that's what

1223
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,769
killed him

1224
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:25,108
so yeah I have nothing that anytime that

1225
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:27,480
guy talks I just oh my [ __ ] eyes and

1226
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:29,460
hope I don't see him in person well I

1227
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,130
mean interestingly enough there seems to

1228
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,740
be a lot of info online which you know

1229
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:37,050
indicates that you guys argue over the

1230
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:39,569
origins of the purple elephant slash you

1231
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,250
know the grapes Tompa how do you feel

1232
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,050
about that all you know where where do

1233
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:46,260
you see it it was just them who made the

1234
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:48,119
grape stomp or was it Jojo Jojo made it

1235
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,260
was originally called sour grapes he

1236
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,630
passed it out to a bunch of people but

1237
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,490
he never sold it he had a specific clone

1238
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,250
that he liked and that was the sour

1239
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:58,108
grapes mom that has passed out to all of

1240
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,630
us that was also given to gage who was

1241
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:02,699
supposed to be his friend and gage went

1242
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,559
and sold it to blue sky cafe as sour

1243
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,000
grapes and then he started getting mad

1244
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,989
said I kind of like the name grape stomp

1245
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,559
for better and that's what he made this

1246
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:11,849
heat light ass okay but gage has nothing

1247
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,769
to do with the actual genesis of the

1248
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:16,108
string just hijacked someone else's same

1249
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:18,150
with his blackberry pie and that was

1250
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:20,969
JoJo's there's countless other [ __ ] he's

1251
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:25,369
done that with so it's nothing new and

1252
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:27,779
so do you feel like it's a interesting

1253
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:29,519
situation that you guys you know like

1254
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,590
both breed with the same cup but there's

1255
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:32,940
this kind of animosity between the two

1256
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:35,340
is because the reason I bring it up is

1257
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,889
there's kind of like a reincarnation of

1258
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,809
that right now between gromer and seed

1259
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:40,879
junkie where

1260
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:42,469
less you know grown is probably gonna

1261
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,150
breed with some of seed junkie seeds

1262
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:46,219
even those seed junkies made it somewhat

1263
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,079
obvious he would not like that you know

1264
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:49,818
do you feel like there's almost some

1265
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,459
parallels between that and you engage

1266
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:54,048
with the Stompa who are they I don't

1267
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:56,088
think I've ever heard of them I'm just

1268
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:57,489
kidding I um I don't know they're

1269
00:46:56,088 --> 00:47:02,929
nobodies to me they're they're new

1270
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:05,088
welcome yeah okay so I guess maybe the

1271
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:07,729
way I should rephrase the question is do

1272
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:11,418
you do you think that your rights over a

1273
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:12,858
seed line kind of whatever you want to

1274
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:14,150
do with it as soon as you acquire them

1275
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:16,278
or do you believe like you know you

1276
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,358
should respect the creator's wishes or

1277
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:20,208
something like that or is it like not

1278
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:23,139
yours you've got it what the problem is

1279
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:25,908
the creators been passed for a long time

1280
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:28,608
you know so in general like with any

1281
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:30,108
save save on I mean you know like if the

1282
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:31,369
people aren't if a breeder isn't

1283
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:32,449
currently making the seed line he's not

1284
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:34,429
making the money off and he's not done

1285
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,838
how many plans to come back then I would

1286
00:47:34,429 --> 00:47:37,608
say as long as you credit him properly

1287
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,798
and you've done your research then

1288
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:41,239
that's fine and dandy but if you're

1289
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:43,219
going in like eff doing people seed

1290
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:45,380
lines like and just changing the name

1291
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:46,458
that's really just the big slap in the

1292
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,028
face you can't do that any other

1293
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:50,509
industry

1294
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:55,130
well you shouldn't yeah okay interesting

1295
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:57,108
and yeah similarly we've seen a bit of

1296
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,150
an argument between I don't have a site

1297
00:47:57,108 --> 00:48:01,458
now you have food between Melo from the

1298
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,588
nature farm and yourself between these

1299
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:06,489
the discrepancies in the roadkill lines

1300
00:48:03,588 --> 00:48:08,358
what you are taking this his line is

1301
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:10,608
phenotypically seems different to yours

1302
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:13,068
I don't I don't know who he is

1303
00:48:10,608 --> 00:48:15,909
I don't think do I have I said something

1304
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:20,748
to him I might have said so I don't know

1305
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:22,969
the [ __ ] Club yeah when every post

1306
00:48:20,748 --> 00:48:26,358
photos of he's uh he's roadkill on he's

1307
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:29,749
working on you he who says like skunk

1308
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:33,650
IBL 69 that guy yeah yeah man oh yeah I

1309
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:36,708
mean that he has a skunk from 1969 that

1310
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:39,409
is like that is the most [ __ ] asinine

1311
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:41,178
[ __ ] I've ever heard it takes all it

1312
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:42,709
takes us like ten minutes of research to

1313
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:45,349
realize oh wait there weren't really

1314
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:47,328
many Afghan EES come into the US in 1969

1315
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:49,039
normally they being harvested for their

1316
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:51,469
own [ __ ] in Afghanistan they were still

1317
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,549
importing Indian sativa plants for hash

1318
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:54,829
so

1319
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:58,608
that claims [ __ ] just stupid it just

1320
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:59,839
did yeah no no and it's not an IPL if

1321
00:48:58,608 --> 00:49:02,449
there's more than one phenotype it's not

1322
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:05,028
a [ __ ] IPL I'd be able to notes

1323
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:06,349
uniformity and I see people use that and

1324
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:07,759
it makes me roll my [ __ ] eyes so you

1325
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:11,929
just had a bunch of I [ __ ] balls

1326
00:49:07,759 --> 00:49:14,329
that's it yeah okay and so I mean if we

1327
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:16,969
get back to say maybe riot seeds one of

1328
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:20,390
many strains one for example called

1329
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:23,208
blood rose nuclear is being created by a

1330
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:24,528
colleague skunk Oh as yes having you

1331
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:27,798
know other colleagues like flip

1332
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:29,329
do you consider Riot seeds to be you as

1333
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,998
an individual like a one-man operation

1334
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:34,729
or more of like an umbrella for kind of

1335
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:35,958
you know you and your friends it's do

1336
00:49:34,728 --> 00:49:37,399
you know there's been so many people

1337
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:41,858
that had a far as my company there were

1338
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:43,999
times when I like I just lost a lot of I

1339
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:45,708
want to do anything in this business

1340
00:49:43,998 --> 00:49:47,509
just from just being jaded by all the

1341
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,978
[ __ ] heads and there are a lot of times

1342
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:50,630
other people picked up and ran with my

1343
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:52,788
company and kept it going there's a guy

1344
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:54,410
named 46 and two like he took a lot of

1345
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,089
the work that I had and he kept it going

1346
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:57,409
out there or kept passing it out kept

1347
00:49:56,088 --> 00:50:00,048
making sure everything was going while I

1348
00:49:57,409 --> 00:50:01,639
was gone there's a guy named Racer X he

1349
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:03,978
did the same thing and he's helped out

1350
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:07,728
probably more than anyone else

1351
00:50:03,978 --> 00:50:09,798
a skunk oh he made two lines for us and

1352
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:11,448
he's an amazing guy he just you know

1353
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,619
he's a wonderful guide to there's been

1354
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:14,959
so many people that are part of our

1355
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:17,119
organization and most of them are the

1356
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:18,649
same kind of guys or just just people

1357
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,818
who don't give a [ __ ] about what people

1358
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:24,979
have to say and so the this has actually

1359
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:29,358
been a question we got asked a lot from

1360
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:30,379
people the PFS one seeds what's the guy

1361
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:33,048
when are they coming

1362
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:36,259
oh the piss I made those years ago but I

1363
00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:37,639
wasn't allowed to do the S ones the guy

1364
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,838
got it from was a bouncer for the

1365
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:41,568
Dominicans in New York

1366
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,998
a guy named doggystyle D 79 and he's

1367
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:45,650
been around the forums forever he passed

1368
00:50:43,998 --> 00:50:48,409
me the fifth lines there was one line

1369
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:51,019
called h-11 like all h2 the h1 was like

1370
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:52,639
the frankincense type line h2 was more

1371
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:54,768
like a mango haze type line something

1372
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:59,449
similar to that you see from shanty with

1373
00:50:54,768 --> 00:51:00,649
his mango haze and all I was told was

1374
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:02,778
you know you can make as many hybrids

1375
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,528
with this as you want just don't s want

1376
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:07,940
it don't release appear that's it

1377
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:10,969
okay interesting yet and two people

1378
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:13,989
holding out for it so similarly another

1379
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:16,429
strain caught my eye was the p90 one

1380
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:19,429
yeah that's the one San Diego strength

1381
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:20,929
yeah so what's the history behind that

1382
00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:23,838
and how come no one else seems to breed

1383
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:25,248
with it bastions been gone for a long

1384
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:28,849
time we'll leave few people including

1385
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:30,649
the breeder of captives it's hard to

1386
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:32,900
find there's like a p90 one skunk line

1387
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,759
that gets passed around but for the most

1388
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,048
part that line was really hard I

1389
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,579
searched for it for ten years before I

1390
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:42,318
got a legit cut from the breeder and

1391
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:46,039
that was hard it's supposed to be

1392
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:48,739
according to him a silverback tie across

1393
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,329
to Northern Lights I want to say but

1394
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,829
there's really not a lot of titrate

1395
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:54,380
something that it being very very bushy

1396
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:56,028
it's a very very bushy plant but it's

1397
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,509
called p90 one because it's peanut

1398
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:59,119
buttery

1399
00:51:56,509 --> 00:52:02,778
so for peanut and ninety one because it

1400
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:06,608
was made in 1991 okay interesting and do

1401
00:52:02,778 --> 00:52:10,159
you plan to make any swans with it again

1402
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:13,038
you know the cut is very old

1403
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,088
it wasn't kept very well it's one of

1404
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,650
those things that like I'd like to

1405
00:52:14,088 --> 00:52:16,940
tissue culture first and then go ahead

1406
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,170
and give it another run to s ones I just

1407
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,179
really wasn't really happy with the

1408
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:22,278
uniformity of it it was hard to find a

1409
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:25,098
lot of really super peanutty phenotypes

1410
00:52:22,278 --> 00:52:27,079
the line could be s1 a few times to get

1411
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:37,729
some uniformity to make sure that's more

1412
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:39,410
reliable yeah okay what are the

1413
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:41,268
characteristics about it that you like

1414
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:43,190
and how come again you don't think many

1415
00:52:41,268 --> 00:52:46,399
other people use it it seems like you

1416
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:50,269
know a hidden gem which which one from

1417
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,338
Sonny the neon Super Skunk oh you know

1418
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:53,448
that was just that mostly used it

1419
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:54,828
because I was trying at the time I was

1420
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:58,219
trying to find really good black russian

1421
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:00,739
strains and early on Sonny was one of

1422
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:02,179
few people there was really like amazing

1423
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:03,588
to me and this is before he left for a

1424
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:06,469
long time and kind of disappeared after

1425
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:07,759
the TGA thing he was one of the few

1426
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:09,469
people I could talk to about breeding

1427
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:14,028
purples him and a guy named EBU I

1428
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:15,708
personally think are responsible for so

1429
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:17,449
many of the purple purple work out there

1430
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:19,129
and pink work I mean I couldn't have

1431
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:20,930
done it without them there'd be no

1432
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,579
to have none of my purple/pink work and

1433
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:24,529
a lot of people attribute you know a lot

1434
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:26,299
of my work to being some some of the the

1435
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:29,269
most prolific purple in paperwork but I

1436
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:31,130
trip into all that to those to the neon

1437
00:53:29,269 --> 00:53:32,989
Super Skunk was a black Russian line and

1438
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,519
at the time Black Russian was really

1439
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:35,089
hard to find and that was me blues black

1440
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:37,219
Russian

1441
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:40,250
it's a cherry AKA crossed to the oregon

1442
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:41,750
blackberry oregon blackberry is a purple

1443
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,940
pakistani to trolley and at the time

1444
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:46,010
that was a lot harder to find nowadays

1445
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,139
back to tenecia trolley the purple feed

1446
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:51,500
you know is everywhere at the time was

1447
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:52,789
really hard to find so you know I the

1448
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,900
only reason I worked with the neon super

1449
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:55,250
skunk was just because of the Black

1450
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,010
Russian it wasn't so much because of the

1451
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:01,340
super skunk but it's it all-in-all was

1452
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:03,920
an amazing line okay and how do you feel

1453
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,000
about people kind of there's you know

1454
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,500
certainly seems to be a rising

1455
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,869
popularity of people wanting to go back

1456
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,849
to those more raw land racy unworked

1457
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:14,089
type of stuff you know do you feel like

1458
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:15,460
this is a well spent effort or maybe a

1459
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,510
waste of time

1460
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,119
it just depends on who's doing the work

1461
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:23,030
I mean any [ __ ] kid [ __ ] something

1462
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,559
up that's nice you know I don't know

1463
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,610
it's just depend on to tune to work a

1464
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,659
lot of people I see you're trying to

1465
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:28,039
play your stuff like that and that's

1466
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:30,109
finally dandy but if they don't know how

1467
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:31,039
it breeds or out crosses they don't

1468
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,789
understand what they're doing with it

1469
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,230
they don't really have a direction

1470
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:35,210
they're just making crosses to make

1471
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,829
crosses you're I'm just shooting in the

1472
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,920
dark and it's going to be a lot of work

1473
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:41,900
for everyone else so do you ever think

1474
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,849
that we will have you know like another

1475
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,470
strain emerge that just totally takes

1476
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:47,269
over the market maybe similar to how

1477
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:49,759
skunk or Northern Lights do when they

1478
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:51,289
were first released or yeah I mean og

1479
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,640
cush og cush was one that absolutely

1480
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:54,019
took over the market and it's a staple

1481
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,129
now just as much as any stunt or

1482
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:59,900
anything else you know and there's gonna

1483
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:01,280
be more I mean cookies cookies has made

1484
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,889
quite a stamp on it and even though it's

1485
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,320
not that a whole wholly different from

1486
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:08,210
an Urkel or an OG it still has made its

1487
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,010
mark and there's gonna be plenty more to

1488
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,300
come I mean there's still a lot of lines

1489
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,460
a lot of us are taking up and just

1490
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,560
playing with like we have a Senegalese

1491
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,659
line from Africa that has like a

1492
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:19,639
understands the distinctive light you

1493
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:21,649
smell which is not a terpene you find

1494
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:23,980
mode in cannabis anywhere and it's very

1495
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:26,599
specific to that and it also is a

1496
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:29,840
landrace sativa or heirloom sativa or

1497
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,460
more correctly that is really resinous

1498
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,840
and you don't see that a lot so I mean

1499
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,079
there's a lot of strengths out there

1500
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,970
that

1501
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:39,019
gonna be able to bring a lot more

1502
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:41,230
uniqueness and to our lines okay and so

1503
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:44,329
what do you think about the idea of

1504
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,590
breeding for turbans specifically or and

1505
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:47,509
then like maybe a follow up to that is

1506
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:50,329
do you think it's possible for cannabis

1507
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:54,410
to create literally any smell with its

1508
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:55,579
terpenes that's a hard question I don't

1509
00:55:54,409 --> 00:55:57,170
know I think anybody knows the answer to

1510
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:58,340
that truly if we can make any smell or

1511
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:01,369
any taste because I know that there's a

1512
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,050
lot missing from the palate but III I

1513
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:05,539
mean eventually if you have enough

1514
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:07,580
colors you you know in your arsenal you

1515
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:10,429
could paint any pictures so I that

1516
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:12,619
eventually will get their breeding for

1517
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:14,179
terpenes I mean we did that with the

1518
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,489
blue berry line that we were work that

1519
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:18,019
we call riot berry and trying to find

1520
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:20,359
that original blue berry that is just

1521
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:22,849
completely blue berry no skunk that was

1522
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,620
a really hard hard thing to do I mean we

1523
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:26,150
spent thousands and thousands on ploop

1524
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:29,269
different blueberry lines from BJ short

1525
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:30,860
I mean all of it probably descends from

1526
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:33,619
DJ short to work originally but like

1527
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,809
going to the Canadian blueberries from

1528
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:37,609
DJ's work with singer Massa DJ's worth

1529
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:39,110
of Dutch fashion they're all different

1530
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,610
levels of blueberry but none of them

1531
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:42,920
were really kicking out that heavy-duty

1532
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,050
blueberry smell and bred reliably and

1533
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,389
you know outcross that blueberry smell

1534
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:49,519
and the purple traits so I mean that's

1535
00:56:47,389 --> 00:56:51,769
that's a good example of terpene work

1536
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:54,170
that took a long time and was and

1537
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:56,150
definitely worth it in the end and so

1538
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:57,829
how do you feel about the whole kind of

1539
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,900
crazed with terpenes at the moment you

1540
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:02,269
know you see people getting concentrates

1541
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:06,410
and just drowning it in liquid beans and

1542
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:10,150
stuff do you think it's a I don't know I

1543
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:13,129
mean looks kind of crack heady to me but

1544
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:14,450
whatever I mean people are gonna always

1545
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,519
do the weirdest [ __ ] they can do with it

1546
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:18,589
and try to try to create new fads with

1547
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:20,449
it terpenes definitely have their place

1548
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:23,150
I mean when I was watching a lot of the

1549
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:24,909
BHO being made originally when it was

1550
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:26,930
happening in Southern California you

1551
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:28,369
were missing out on a lot of the

1552
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:30,440
terpenes and the high was so different

1553
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:33,409
so speedy and it was very predictably

1554
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,539
speedy with any strain so I obviously

1555
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:37,219
they play a big part in the high I think

1556
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:39,349
the the newest things going to be paying

1557
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:40,969
more attention to the flavonoids as well

1558
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:42,469
as the terpenes and the flavonoids have

1559
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:44,689
been really ignored and I think that's

1560
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:46,909
just another thing that just has another

1561
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:49,818
major impact on it

1562
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:52,219
okay and so I mean what is your opinion

1563
00:57:49,818 --> 00:57:54,259
on kind of dabbing versus flowers where

1564
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:56,028
do you sit on the spectrum like and just

1565
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:59,028
as a follow-up I had a friend who kind

1566
00:57:56,028 --> 00:58:00,980
of described America is now a country of

1567
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:03,619
dabbas and not flour smokers you know

1568
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:06,409
did you feel that's the truth yeah yeah

1569
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:10,430
hey I hate to maybe yeah I mean like I I

1570
00:58:06,409 --> 00:58:11,808
myself I would I don't like Debbie not

1571
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:13,909
that I didn't do it for a long time but

1572
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:16,069
it really [ __ ] up my lungs there's

1573
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:17,480
there's too many [ __ ] doing it they

1574
00:58:16,068 --> 00:58:18,619
don't again like everything else and

1575
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,338
their business alleged it's doing it

1576
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:20,960
they don't know what the [ __ ] they're

1577
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:22,190
doing and they can hurt a lot of people

1578
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,559
and they can hurt the lungs they can

1579
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:26,358
make them sick not everyone's getting

1580
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,940
there she tested obviously and not all

1581
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:31,130
the tests are reliable so mm-hmm

1582
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:35,150
flowers didn't have the more complete hi

1583
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:36,559
and more Turkey and content so to me

1584
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,940
that would make the most sense but I

1585
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,200
mean I guess it's all in the preference

1586
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,568
of the person what it does for them

1587
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,068
cannabis is an individual experience the

1588
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:44,268
high is always an individual experience

1589
00:58:43,068 --> 00:58:46,759
no two highs are the same for each

1590
00:58:44,268 --> 00:58:48,828
person so it's just really what it's

1591
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:53,059
that's what it boils down to me I

1592
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:55,400
flowers any day and so how do you feel

1593
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:57,109
about the rise in testing you know

1594
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,358
Oregon seems to start when I say that I

1595
00:58:57,108 --> 00:59:00,768
mean like pesticide and residue testing

1596
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:02,298
things like that because Oregon seems to

1597
00:59:00,768 --> 00:59:04,038
be leading the way do you think it's

1598
00:59:02,298 --> 00:59:06,288
just gonna keep getting more and more

1599
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:09,079
stringent or what kind of bet it would

1600
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:10,579
spot it's hard to say I mean the more we

1601
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:13,818
let government into [ __ ] the more [ __ ]

1602
00:59:10,579 --> 00:59:15,710
up everything gets but at the same time

1603
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:17,808
less stuff like that's necessary people

1604
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:20,778
are gonna get hurt if not yeah

1605
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:22,700
but no I mean as more chemicals are

1606
00:59:20,778 --> 00:59:24,559
being made you know it's getting easier

1607
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:26,629
for people to try to sneak by stuff so

1608
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,390
testings gonna have to get better you

1609
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:34,009
know it's just it's part of it I guess

1610
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:35,808
necessary evil yeah okay and so you know

1611
00:59:34,009 --> 00:59:37,940
it seems like the cannabis industry used

1612
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:39,410
to be very much against feminized seeds

1613
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,450
and there's still a lot of skepticism

1614
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,699
out there but I feel like there is a

1615
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:45,710
slowly changing trend as more and more

1616
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:47,509
mainstream breeders seem to be

1617
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,220
incorporating feminized into their

1618
00:59:47,509 --> 00:59:51,528
projects who were you know in the past

1619
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:53,509
just regular only do you think this is a

1620
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:56,088
changing trend within the community or

1621
00:59:53,509 --> 01:00:00,048
just maybe like a short-term kind of

1622
00:59:56,088 --> 01:00:00,739
change from the norm you know it was

1623
01:00:00,048 --> 01:00:02,239
what's funny is

1624
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:05,239
a lot of the people that were dissenters

1625
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,739
maybe five years ago are now buying my

1626
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:11,118
spray that I make to make their

1627
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:12,559
feminized lines and I you know I don't

1628
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,559
know maybe we're getting more educated

1629
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,789
finally on it I sigh for you years I've

1630
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:18,980
been screamed my head off showing the

1631
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:20,329
science behind it and why I like saying

1632
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,679
this or that applies to feminize see

1633
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:22,880
it's really isn't correct I mean even

1634
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:24,829
using the term feminized it's kind of

1635
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,690
stupid because there's no way you can

1636
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:29,059
guarantee any kind of sex on any plan

1637
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,559
because environment determines you know

1638
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:32,449
at least at least thirty to forty

1639
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,549
percent of what that plants sexual

1640
01:00:32,449 --> 01:00:35,960
characteristics are going to be so the

1641
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:38,539
term feminized really isn't even that

1642
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,460
good of a term l I always used reverse

1643
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:41,570
lines just so it doesn't give that

1644
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:44,110
connotation and people don't have

1645
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:47,030
expectations that are outside of reality

1646
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:48,440
but there are a lot of people that you

1647
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:50,690
know we're against it for one reason or

1648
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,400
another or just what they had heard and

1649
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,470
like they said a lot of those people now

1650
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,470
are buying the spray for me and using it

1651
01:00:54,469 --> 01:01:01,699
and create mine so I think it's probably

1652
01:00:57,469 --> 01:01:04,309
I mean the science is there so people

1653
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:06,379
keep reading it they'll get it and so

1654
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:08,150
what do you feel about the idea of doing

1655
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,250
like and I'm not even sure if this is

1656
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,990
the correct terminology but like s to s

1657
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,300
and s threes you know like making s ones

1658
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:16,099
of s ones do you feel like that's going

1659
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,680
down a shaky path or it's fine as long

1660
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:19,880
as selections good as long as the

1661
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:21,440
selections good as long as the lines

1662
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,230
good I mean just run the progeny and

1663
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,990
then yeah I mean a lot of lines a lot of

1664
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:30,829
lines are you know I guess I would call

1665
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:32,750
it like s1 R or f1 are f1 reversals f2

1666
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:37,369
reversals things like that that's

1667
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:38,780
usually how we denote it but yeah it's

1668
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:40,608
kind of like if you use a shitty line

1669
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:42,140
and you keep crossing it out even if

1670
01:01:40,608 --> 01:01:44,449
it's a regular line you're gonna get

1671
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:46,009
[ __ ] same thing with s ones if you keep

1672
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:47,358
reversing a plant that kind of sucks and

1673
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,710
has little some shitty traits it's just

1674
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:52,279
going to get more and more obvious as

1675
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:54,590
you go on and so have you ever seen a

1676
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,240
plant come from an s1 that was better

1677
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,920
than the parent cuz I kind of oh yeah

1678
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:59,868
that I couldn't couldn't see an obvious

1679
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,090
you know well-known clone only that was

1680
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:06,950
like you know s1 that was better than

1681
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:10,220
the parent ogk be probably I mean if

1682
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:13,129
that is an s-1 over the forum I would

1683
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:14,358
say that's a perfect example of it okay

1684
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,599
yeah cuz the interesting thing around

1685
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:16,548
that

1686
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:19,130
is I think the guy who found that one

1687
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:21,650
claims that it was from the same seed

1688
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:23,210
stalkers like the original Girl Scout

1689
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,920
cookie he's like you know like they did

1690
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:27,588
the forum cut would be a sister so to

1691
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,778
speak yeah then I would make it an S one

1692
01:02:27,588 --> 01:02:32,058
is something because it was a yeah yeah

1693
01:02:29,778 --> 01:02:34,940
so yeah I mean it would be yeah I mean

1694
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:38,119
the same kind of thing that I have when

1695
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:40,039
I reversed Bubba and we did a large

1696
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:41,869
population there was one phenotype in it

1697
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:44,839
there was an arrow leashed type Bubba

1698
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:47,298
plant and it had big apical buds that

1699
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:48,768
just one main meristem you know and as

1700
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:51,139
opposed to being a short squat little

1701
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:52,399
plant yeah it was tall and had big colas

1702
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:53,808
and it smelled like father tastes like

1703
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,960
lava but the high was so much more

1704
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:58,849
complex lasted longer and in general

1705
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,499
everybody seemed to prefer way over the

1706
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:02,809
original Bubba and everybody that I know

1707
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:05,629
loves you original Bubba that's another

1708
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:08,450
example of an s-1 that's just in my

1709
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:10,940
opinion just about it the parent by

1710
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:12,259
leaps and bounds Oh fantastic

1711
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:14,809
so I mean yeah do you think we'll ever

1712
01:03:12,259 --> 01:03:16,909
see any more platinum banana OGS ones

1713
01:03:14,809 --> 01:03:18,739
that's that's another good example um

1714
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:22,940
the original platinum banana og was a

1715
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:25,130
great line but there are s1 ones that

1716
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:27,650
came out they're phenomenal

1717
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:29,749
even better than the mother so if I do

1718
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,519
it I may take one of the S ones as

1719
01:03:29,748 --> 01:03:33,439
opposed to the mother and use one of

1720
01:03:31,518 --> 01:03:35,298
them because they're like some of those

1721
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,979
were just absolutely beautiful the more

1722
01:03:35,298 --> 01:03:39,498
black colored ones that were just had

1723
01:03:36,978 --> 01:03:43,038
resin caked on it and smelled and tasted

1724
01:03:39,498 --> 01:03:44,659
like banana Laffy Taffy so yeah I

1725
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,069
release it again I made I may release

1726
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:50,978
the original mom s ones but I'll

1727
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:53,179
definitely do an s-1 reversal as well

1728
01:03:50,978 --> 01:03:55,489
fantastic so I mean some of your

1729
01:03:53,179 --> 01:03:57,768
previous work you've worked with some of

1730
01:03:55,489 --> 01:03:59,869
the more raw land where AC type stuff

1731
01:03:57,768 --> 01:04:01,968
we've spoken about earlier I think one

1732
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:04,818
of them I saw was get the chem dog

1733
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:07,548
Columbian gold Harvard you did do you

1734
01:04:04,818 --> 01:04:09,679
think these are good breeding tools so

1735
01:04:07,548 --> 01:04:11,268
to speak or they can just kind of make

1736
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,498
things harder to work with you know do

1737
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,788
you think it'll be an ongoing trend in

1738
01:04:12,498 --> 01:04:16,759
the future to work with you know like a

1739
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:19,609
new school meets old school hybrid well

1740
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:20,900
that one specifically was work Luca had

1741
01:04:19,608 --> 01:04:23,420
done originally and he brought it down

1742
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:25,369
to about 16 weeks the hybrid and then we

1743
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,469
ran in after you selection and brought

1744
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:28,099
it down to 10 to 14 weeks we even had

1745
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:30,108
ten weeks

1746
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:32,749
and honestly that was one of my favorite

1747
01:04:30,108 --> 01:04:35,838
lines during those years that I ever

1748
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:37,669
worked with and worked but it didn't

1749
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,788
sell people had zero [ __ ] interest in

1750
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:44,028
it wasn't OG Kush at the time Kim dog de

1751
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:45,589
was not in that big a demand many when

1752
01:04:44,028 --> 01:04:47,119
Kim has always been in big demand but at

1753
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:48,440
the time Kim dog D just really wasn't

1754
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,838
that big of a deal but now you know

1755
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:53,329
people know about star dog and they know

1756
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:54,768
that that's you know from the d-line so

1757
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:56,028
a lot of people more more people have

1758
01:04:54,768 --> 01:04:59,149
been wanting it over the past few years

1759
01:04:56,028 --> 01:05:01,278
and that shit's a long gone now so but

1760
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:02,869
that tends to be the the trait I mean it

1761
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:04,639
takes people a while to catch up to what

1762
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:05,930
a lot of breeders are working with it

1763
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,058
takes several years for them to start

1764
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:10,788
getting hip to land race work and what's

1765
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:12,440
good yeah I mean what's your opinion on

1766
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:14,839
the Kim dog family is such you know it's

1767
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:18,440
a very popular discussion topic on that

1768
01:05:14,838 --> 01:05:21,078
show my favorites gzhel cheese diesel

1769
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,019
it's the mass Super Skunk cross to the

1770
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:25,278
Kim dog de it's not one of the original

1771
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:27,588
seeds from the Kim dog line that Gregg

1772
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:30,380
had but it's good you know it's one of

1773
01:05:27,588 --> 01:05:32,958
my favorites I think it because us one

1774
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:34,519
the gzhel you can actually see each one

1775
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,748
of those phenotypes of the chem 91 you

1776
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:37,909
can see the D you can see before you can

1777
01:05:35,748 --> 01:05:39,708
see the sister all on those Versalles of

1778
01:05:37,909 --> 01:05:41,239
just the diesel because it's and because

1779
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:43,690
it's so strong with the mast super spell

1780
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:47,659
parent it's actually very similar in

1781
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:50,869
high smell and looks to the mast super

1782
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:52,909
skunk yeah that's that's why it's one of

1783
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:58,489
my favorites that up for the original

1784
01:05:52,909 --> 01:06:00,768
line I really liked for but I mean some

1785
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:02,119
people prefer the te for the high I just

1786
01:06:00,768 --> 01:06:04,458
didn't like Kim dog because it smelled

1787
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:06,798
like baby [ __ ] and whose made me really

1788
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:12,038
disgusted like in mid flour it just has

1789
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:14,528
this awful fecal baby [ __ ] runny smell

1790
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:19,190
and that was pretty disgusting and foul

1791
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:20,838
yeah okay so what's your take on naming

1792
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:22,670
strands you know and the reason why I

1793
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:25,389
ask is because I feel like I can kind of

1794
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:28,009
spot your names sometimes of the strain

1795
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:29,509
the thing is though you don't seem to go

1796
01:06:28,009 --> 01:06:30,798
by like you know the standard

1797
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:33,228
nomenclature where it's like you know

1798
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,998
blueberry crust og call it blue og or

1799
01:06:33,228 --> 01:06:36,498
whatever you know what's your approach

1800
01:06:34,998 --> 01:06:38,208
to naming strains and how do you feel

1801
01:06:36,498 --> 01:06:39,108
about that whole new mega litter I

1802
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:41,289
mentioned where you know people just

1803
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:44,650
kind of ramming two names together

1804
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:45,820
um you know early I would do that that

1805
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,380
was like the top popular nomenclature

1806
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,760
and that was what people did like if his

1807
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:51,220
blue haze it you call it blue haze you

1808
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:53,830
know if it was a blueberry bubblegum it

1809
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:55,329
was bubble berry but I don't know I

1810
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:56,769
don't know how I come up with any of the

1811
01:06:55,329 --> 01:06:58,690
names I do a lot of rich is [ __ ]

1812
01:06:56,769 --> 01:07:02,559
gonna pull out my ass or it's a punk

1813
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:04,059
rock Ken's name I don't know I I have

1814
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,799
theirs I'm reppin this with naming I've

1815
01:07:04,059 --> 01:07:07,059
made a lot of stupid names stuff that I

1816
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,800
don't like and I don't keep in the end

1817
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:10,199
and some stuff that I just keep because

1818
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,390
I'm too lazy and even though it sucks

1819
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:14,739
but I have learned that sometimes the

1820
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:17,769
name is everything when it comes to a

1821
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:20,259
strain so I probably should pay more

1822
01:07:17,769 --> 01:07:27,400
attention to it I just don't care on

1823
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:29,980
that part yeah okay and so we don't

1824
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,139
routinely at least or ever see you

1825
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,630
attend cannabis cups or events like that

1826
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:36,690
you know do you just avoid them because

1827
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,500
of kind of you know all the previous

1828
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:40,030
interactions with people or you just

1829
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,949
don't see the real value in going to

1830
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:44,140
them no I've gone like the ones in

1831
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:47,049
Denver the first few years I went to the

1832
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:48,519
80s I cup when I went that year I don't

1833
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:50,530
ever have trouble with anyone because

1834
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:52,269
people were [ __ ] usually I'll talk

1835
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:56,290
online and [ __ ] in the frame person

1836
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:59,170
but I don't like high times they're

1837
01:07:56,289 --> 01:08:00,670
[ __ ] [ __ ] so I call them high

1838
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:03,090
crimes because all they are is one big

1839
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:05,380
long [ __ ] advertisement for [ __ ]

1840
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:06,430
so I don't really have any purpose of

1841
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,769
going to their cups and giving them

1842
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:10,179
money there's other cups like the

1843
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:11,349
Emerald cup and stuff I didn't go this

1844
01:08:10,179 --> 01:08:14,279
year just cuz I was dealing with a lot

1845
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:16,210
of chaos same thing the year before but

1846
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,530
Bodie always tries to get me to go to

1847
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:18,760
those with them and it's just that's the

1848
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:20,500
only reason I haven't it's just because

1849
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,588
it's usually life [ __ ] going on at the

1850
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:27,310
time but other cups I don't know I just

1851
01:08:23,588 --> 01:08:29,140
don't care guess a lot of people that go

1852
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:30,730
enter those or a lot of the newbie

1853
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,740
[ __ ] that are trying to prove

1854
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:34,599
something you've already been there done

1855
01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:39,969
that and don't care I don't need an

1856
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:42,010
award to satisfy my ego yeah okay and so

1857
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:43,480
I think you know what's one of maybe the

1858
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:48,100
most unexpected friendship in the

1859
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:49,779
industry being yourself and Bodie really

1860
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,250
really dig Bodie I'm sure they'd be

1861
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:53,198
interested how did you meet him and you

1862
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:58,329
know developed this friendship over time

1863
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:59,710
ah Wow me and Bodi how do we meet I we

1864
01:08:58,329 --> 01:09:04,059
were just both making seeds at the same

1865
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:06,338
time he was doing it before I was even I

1866
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:08,140
don't know you just always kind of

1867
01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:11,318
gotten along really well he's obviously

1868
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:13,719
like my polar opposite he's very quiet

1869
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:15,489
very reserved super nice never has

1870
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:18,609
anything negative to say about anyone

1871
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:19,629
ever he's really sweet me and him when

1872
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:22,750
we talk we don't even really talk about

1873
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:24,489
cannabis that much he has pretty good

1874
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:27,819
knowledge of punk rock history and final

1875
01:09:24,488 --> 01:09:29,889
so we get along talking about that no no

1876
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:31,690
it's just one of those things where we

1877
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:33,579
are polar opposites but we totally get

1878
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:35,948
along this one it's a really weird

1879
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:38,289
pairing and same with loompa loop is

1880
01:09:35,948 --> 01:09:42,189
very much like Bodhi very calm quiet

1881
01:09:38,289 --> 01:09:46,119
reserved just one of those things you

1882
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:49,988
know they get me yeah somehow linked to

1883
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:51,698
the yang yeah it is so and we and and

1884
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:53,259
and when people attack them they'll just

1885
01:09:51,698 --> 01:09:54,460
back down because they're nice and they

1886
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:56,170
don't care to get into it and I'll just

1887
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:59,890
rip into people so it just kind of works

1888
01:09:56,170 --> 01:10:01,960
out and so would you ever see yourself

1889
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:06,190
doing a collaboration with either them

1890
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:07,689
or just other breeders you know well I

1891
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:09,460
mean I've done collaborations with

1892
01:10:07,689 --> 01:10:12,009
loompa earlier last year we were gonna

1893
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:13,359
do it see pink together but just a lot

1894
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:16,119
of stuff happening with his company and

1895
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:18,399
someone trying to screw him over really

1896
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:19,779
bad and so that kind of got put on hold

1897
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:21,129
for a while

1898
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:22,420
me and Bodhi do do a lot of stuff

1899
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,710
together but it's more like passing

1900
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,090
clones back and forth and then we'll

1901
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:27,219
work with each other's cuts like I work

1902
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,659
with this purple unicorn cut and I think

1903
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:31,000
I'm the only person that works with that

1904
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:33,069
specific cut and it's pretty amazing

1905
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,869
it's absolutely amazing it's some of

1906
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:39,099
JoJo's work acrostic MD yeah you know

1907
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:40,269
that's that's that's pretty much how

1908
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,739
we've done and I give him a lot of my

1909
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,000
landrace lines that I collect over the

1910
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,678
years that because I don't have a lot of

1911
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,189
outdoor space so I just given to him to

1912
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:50,529
run and would you ever be interested in

1913
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:52,719
you know going and doing the you know

1914
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:54,909
machete in one hand hacking through

1915
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,380
Amazonian jungles to get your own land

1916
01:10:54,909 --> 01:10:59,559
race oh you're not really interested in

1917
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:01,929
that no I loved you it's just um I don't

1918
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,250
know I I don't have that ability to just

1919
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:05,050
walk away from my plants and leave them

1920
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:06,850
and trust someone to take care of my

1921
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:08,650
really really paranoid about that

1922
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:11,500
so I don't really do that I don't leave

1923
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:13,629
a whole lot to go on big adventures yeah

1924
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,140
that would be putting my company at risk

1925
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:18,369
and that's just kind of I don't know

1926
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,990
yeah okay so welcome but it would be

1927
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:22,949
nice

1928
01:11:18,989 --> 01:11:25,119
what plan have you had for the longest

1929
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:26,349
well we had the Clockwork Orange mom the

1930
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:28,050
longest I would have to say that that's

1931
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:30,579
probably one that survived the longest

1932
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,779
not the original one from Doug but the

1933
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:33,250
because that wasn't called clock

1934
01:11:31,779 --> 01:11:35,710
performance that was just then Alaska

1935
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:37,090
nice plant of some sort but the one that

1936
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:38,800
became known as Clockwork Orange that

1937
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:42,310
one's stayed the longest and that's

1938
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,960
that's not through any awesomeness of my

1939
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:45,130
own I've passed it to other people and

1940
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,390
had to get it back from them and I've

1941
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:47,800
been very fortunate that the people that

1942
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:50,560
passed it to if God didn't gotten her

1943
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:52,779
back to me okay fantasy and I mean I

1944
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,520
guess you may be answered indirectly but

1945
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:57,460
you no longer hang on to that original

1946
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:00,550
Alaskan RS plant no no we lost that

1947
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:02,560
early early on after we made some of the

1948
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:04,449
first rounds of seats with it trying to

1949
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,860
get rid of that crinkled phenotype

1950
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:07,059
because we thought well that's pretty

1951
01:12:05,859 --> 01:12:08,289
ugly there's no real reason to keep the

1952
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,670
mom now that we have the seeds we can

1953
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:11,019
pick a better phenotype that doesn't

1954
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,760
have that crinkle and that just wasn't

1955
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,780
the case it so for some reason that

1956
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:18,159
crinkle goes hand in hand with the

1957
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:19,630
potency yeah okay interesting and so how

1958
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,189
do you feel about the whole organics

1959
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:25,329
both synthetics you know like where do

1960
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:29,079
you see it in the growing spectrum I use

1961
01:12:25,329 --> 01:12:30,550
what I got I mean any to me it's it's

1962
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:32,619
like you know some people are diehard

1963
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:34,480
organics and people are diehard TLO like

1964
01:12:32,619 --> 01:12:36,489
my buddy at the Rev like he's the T I

1965
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,929
think he's like the TLO master I really

1966
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:42,340
do and he knows what he's talking about

1967
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:44,470
he's taught so many people I I'm

1968
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:47,230
sponsored by botanic air and a few other

1969
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:49,260
people and obviously you know there's

1970
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:51,969
some synthetics and the lines but I

1971
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,380
don't even care if it's a bottle of in a

1972
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:54,699
bottle of pee in a bottle okay I can

1973
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:55,960
make it work and that's just what it is

1974
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:58,000
I mean whether it's organic or inorganic

1975
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,409
I can look at the plant I know what it

1976
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,420
needs and that's why every grower should

1977
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:02,439
be I think no matter what they use they

1978
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,359
should just be able to look at the plant

1979
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:07,059
know exactly what the plant needs not

1980
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:09,880
overfeed and just you know feed

1981
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:10,420
according to what the plant desires so I

1982
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,949
don't know

1983
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:14,079
that's about rice depend on it I'm

1984
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:16,269
pretty indifferent yeah I mean so like

1985
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:18,399
do you that you can get a pretty

1986
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:19,960
consistent but from either or is there

1987
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:20,369
one method yeah you just personally kind

1988
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,250
of

1989
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:25,449
now I mean I cross both boundaries like

1990
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,890
just depending on what I'm using I

1991
01:13:25,449 --> 01:13:29,380
usually use some organic stuff and

1992
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:30,430
inorganic so I mean but I mean as long

1993
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,600
as you know your plant you know what it

1994
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:34,900
wants usually you'll get the same

1995
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:36,340
standard the same standard buds as long

1996
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:39,189
as your environments pretty stable other

1997
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,690
than the feeding yeah okay so what do

1998
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:41,739
you think's the future of growing and

1999
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:43,689
you know like we've seen some pretty

2000
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:45,609
major innovations in terms of you know

2001
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:47,229
like mammoth Bay was like kind of

2002
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:49,479
something people might last or Eve and

2003
01:13:47,229 --> 01:13:51,369
say looking at lighting technology like

2004
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:53,139
Gavita what do you think of some of the

2005
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:54,579
new things that are gonna roll on to the

2006
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:57,550
scene in the next couple years that

2007
01:13:54,579 --> 01:14:00,819
might be game changes well I mean I

2008
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:02,890
think I think Big Pharma coming in

2009
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:04,659
sweeping through California getting the

2010
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:06,910
lobbyists to pass the laws here and [ __ ]

2011
01:14:04,659 --> 01:14:08,319
all the growers I think that's probably

2012
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:10,329
the biggest game change because I think

2013
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,529
a lot of us that are that are pioneers

2014
01:14:10,329 --> 01:14:13,630
in the business you're gonna get screwed

2015
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:15,519
out of our companies and kind of our

2016
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:16,720
careers that would probably be the

2017
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,700
biggest game changer because that'd be a

2018
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,350
defeat for a lot of people who have been

2019
01:14:18,699 --> 01:14:24,059
fighting since the 60s long before I was

2020
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:26,770
involved to to get this legal correctly

2021
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:29,380
you know as far as technology I mean I

2022
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:32,650
mean kavita and the double-ended valve

2023
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:34,720
have made huge leaps and bounds I mean I

2024
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:37,000
used Solace Tech's double-ended stuff

2025
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,170
and it's been it's phenomenal it's it's

2026
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,159
night and day compared to just the

2027
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:43,300
normal HPS or metal halide I love it

2028
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:45,309
yeah okay fantastic

2029
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:48,579
and so where does CBD fit into right

2030
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:52,180
seeds you know like I don't think any

2031
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:54,869
CBD strains from you guys

2032
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:57,250
yeah we've released a few CBD lines but

2033
01:14:54,869 --> 01:14:59,529
the thing I've had a hard problem doing

2034
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:01,510
is when I when I make CBD lines I don't

2035
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:03,309
like to charge a lot for them but they

2036
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:05,260
cost just as much to produce and I'm not

2037
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:07,180
I'm not a big operation I'm not some

2038
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:09,820
massive [ __ ] world you know multi

2039
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:12,010
warehouse operation where I can just you

2040
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:14,859
know afford to take big hits on one and

2041
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:17,199
then charge a bunch for another CBD work

2042
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:18,699
if there's it benefits so many people a

2043
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,949
lot of them children a lot of people

2044
01:15:18,699 --> 01:15:23,079
with Alzheimer's a lot you know kids

2045
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:24,609
with seizures so it's really really hard

2046
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:27,100
for me to even charge anything let alone

2047
01:15:24,609 --> 01:15:28,750
a small amount for them and so I just

2048
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,550
try to do small projects enough to where

2049
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:32,590
I keep enough in stock to be able to

2050
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:34,029
give it away when I want or you know if

2051
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:35,710
someone doesn't necessarily have

2052
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:40,509
an ailment but just want to try it they

2053
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:43,029
can buy it yeah okay and so I mean how

2054
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:44,650
do you feel about the whole THC to CBD

2055
01:15:43,029 --> 01:15:47,349
ratio then you know do you think that

2056
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:49,899
there's an optimum ratio or you know

2057
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:51,220
just pure CBD is best in terms of like

2058
01:15:49,899 --> 01:15:53,949
you know the medical properties of

2059
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:55,750
cannabis so to speak I think I genuinely

2060
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:59,319
think that's that's that depends on the

2061
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:01,630
individual I mean the cannabis even even

2062
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:04,179
in its medical aspects is an individual

2063
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:05,590
experience you'll see some people saying

2064
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:12,190
you know the THC helps a lot of their

2065
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:13,720
cancer their cancer is any anything

2066
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:17,259
through responses they're having the

2067
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,820
medicine that are negative but again

2068
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,260
some people say you know that's only the

2069
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:21,909
CBD stuff that helps me that helps my

2070
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,190
pain well a lot of people are only

2071
01:16:21,909 --> 01:16:27,970
helped by THC from pain so I mean really

2072
01:16:24,189 --> 01:16:30,250
like in generally speaking it's hard to

2073
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:32,140
say I mean it's all an individual

2074
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,630
experience some some people more helped

2075
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:36,490
by a high THC to CBD ratio some people

2076
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:38,350
are more helped by a higher CBD to THC

2077
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:40,689
ratio and summer helped more by that

2078
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:42,160
even one it's it's just so hard to say

2079
01:16:40,689 --> 01:16:44,289
it's so open and I don't think it's all

2080
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:46,300
the science is ready to show what what

2081
01:16:44,289 --> 01:16:49,180
body chemistry works with what best then

2082
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:51,989
that we'll ever know yeah okay

2083
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:55,360
some only individuals neither thing yeah

2084
01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:57,039
okay so I mean you mentioned earlier you

2085
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:59,259
good friends with the Rev you seem to

2086
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:01,630
get featured in Skunk aloy is there any

2087
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:04,000
particular relationship with him you

2088
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:05,680
have is that just a thing where you

2089
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,300
thinks you've got good strains and

2090
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,579
therefore you know it gets featured or

2091
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:12,369
is it more of like a business type deal

2092
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:16,420
way being paid for well we've never paid

2093
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:18,189
for anything with them they they skunk

2094
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:20,260
is one of the few magazines that I've

2095
01:17:18,189 --> 01:17:21,969
been I've been really really focal about

2096
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:24,250
liking because the one they've never

2097
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,600
asked me for a dime never ever never

2098
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:27,010
have asked me for a dime they don't ask

2099
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,690
me for anything

2100
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:30,579
they feature everyone that's in there is

2101
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:31,960
featured on merit it's not because

2102
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,100
they're paying for ads it's not because

2103
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,140
they're doing this of that like high

2104
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,700
times they're not paying for parties for

2105
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:39,369
a high time [ __ ] they're not paying for

2106
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:40,389
awards they're in there on merit they're

2107
01:17:39,369 --> 01:17:43,300
the ones making the waves in the

2108
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:45,700
industry and the revs I've got along

2109
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:48,279
with him so well for a long time just

2110
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:49,599
because that we talk

2111
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:51,599
we're not we don't talk regularly but

2112
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:53,590
maybe once a month or twice a month and

2113
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:56,440
usually it's just about what we're

2114
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:58,449
working with at the time you know but

2115
01:17:56,439 --> 01:18:00,368
yeah I mean they feature my stuff

2116
01:17:58,448 --> 01:18:01,750
because they feel it's on merit then I'm

2117
01:18:00,368 --> 01:18:03,519
the one making the waves in the scene at

2118
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,569
that particular time and then there's a

2119
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,860
few months where I won't be in it

2120
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:07,509
because I'm not you know and that's how

2121
01:18:05,859 --> 01:18:10,238
it goes but I love that I love the fact

2122
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:11,739
that it's unbiased in that sense there's

2123
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:13,328
people in there that I can't stand that

2124
01:18:11,738 --> 01:18:14,948
are making waves but they don't care if

2125
01:18:13,328 --> 01:18:16,389
I can't stand them you know I don't have

2126
01:18:14,948 --> 01:18:17,769
I don't have the ability to influence

2127
01:18:16,389 --> 01:18:21,639
their opinion on anything and I love

2128
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:23,739
that yeah and so on a bit of a similar

2129
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:25,630
topic there there's a lot of controversy

2130
01:18:23,738 --> 01:18:27,509
around that whole attitude seedbank

2131
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:31,029
incident where there was other photos

2132
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:32,710
yeah representing the riot strains woods

2133
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:36,340
what was your take on that what happened

2134
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:38,739
there all right the photos they're

2135
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:42,659
referring to is for skunk pose work with

2136
01:18:38,738 --> 01:18:45,339
blood rose and it was a Heath Robinson's

2137
01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:47,049
black rose was up there as a picture

2138
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:51,340
which was one of the moms from Heath

2139
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:52,929
himself and that wasn't really that big

2140
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,980
of a deal with the attitude it's just I

2141
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:55,690
told him I said that this is what's

2142
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:57,729
going on skunk oh just told me take it

2143
01:18:55,689 --> 01:19:00,009
down that's not the mom take it down

2144
01:18:57,729 --> 01:19:02,109
they took it down what happened with the

2145
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:05,349
attitude there's there's a it was a

2146
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:08,198
two-tiered thing and the first one was

2147
01:19:05,349 --> 01:19:10,809
when we were up there me and sub cool

2148
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:14,469
TGA were the only Americans on that side

2149
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:16,599
at the time not gauge not haze man I was

2150
01:19:14,469 --> 01:19:19,210
the one that brought them on later but

2151
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:20,828
just me and sub cool and I didn't really

2152
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:23,230
know some cool from anyone I didn't know

2153
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:27,069
his husband mr. Jill at the time either

2154
01:19:23,229 --> 01:19:28,479
and they emailed the girl I believe her

2155
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:30,759
name was Natalya at the time and said

2156
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,500
you know what that guy's an [ __ ] if

2157
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,489
he's on here we don't want to be on here

2158
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,868
and at the time there he they were

2159
01:19:33,488 --> 01:19:37,479
making the most money for him I wasn't

2160
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:38,859
making that much money for him so you

2161
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:39,968
know the chick emailed me and said you

2162
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:42,658
know sub cool is one of my good friends

2163
01:19:39,969 --> 01:19:46,029
and he said that you guys are not nice

2164
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:48,488
so we need to talk about what we can do

2165
01:19:46,029 --> 01:19:49,929
to do this can you email them and kind

2166
01:19:48,488 --> 01:19:52,000
of be nice to them and be kissy Kissy

2167
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:54,880
and I said no [ __ ] them I'm not doing

2168
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,020
[ __ ] anyway so that kind of stuck in her

2169
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,059
head that I wouldn't work with her that

2170
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:00,400
way and just go kiss his ass for no good

2171
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:02,050
reason or his wife's husband whatever it

2172
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,269
is is ass

2173
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:07,600
and the other the other problem was that

2174
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:10,030
at the time gage he had just started his

2175
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,400
company and Hays man were on my site and

2176
01:20:10,029 --> 01:20:14,710
I could because they were both friends

2177
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:17,049
and Hays man had just left making seeds

2178
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:18,189
for Moda and they had asked me to sell

2179
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:20,050
their seeds for him they didn't have an

2180
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:21,129
outlet and I said okay I'll do that so

2181
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:22,600
selling their seeds and when the

2182
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:25,359
attitude had originally picked me up I

2183
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:27,100
said I will come on but only if you

2184
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:28,779
bring these two guys with me because

2185
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,579
when I go up I want my friends to go up

2186
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:32,590
that's just how it goes you know and at

2187
01:20:30,579 --> 01:20:34,269
that time I was also trying I was put I

2188
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,500
was pushing Bodhi so hard to go on the

2189
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:37,780
attitude he didn't really want to at the

2190
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,250
time just because he approaches

2191
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:40,569
everything very cautiously he's smart

2192
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:44,890
and smarter than I was that's what damn

2193
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:47,079
sure and so I got gage on there in Hays

2194
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:49,750
man and they picked up five packs from

2195
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:51,100
each just an easily five pack order but

2196
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:52,329
they agreed that that's what they would

2197
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,350
do at the time and if they sold well

2198
01:20:52,329 --> 01:20:55,809
then they'd pick up more and I said

2199
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:57,460
great that's great I didn't make a dime

2200
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:59,340
off in their cells that wasn't the point

2201
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:02,050
but the point was to get them on there

2202
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:04,090
then gage sent me an email and said hey

2203
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:05,710
man I would love your contact at the

2204
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:08,020
attitudes email address I could thank

2205
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:09,399
her and I was like okay well whatever

2206
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,420
yeah I'm not making any money off you I

2207
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:11,559
don't give a [ __ ] if people around my

2208
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:12,909
back I mean it was obvious what he was

2209
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,950
doing but I didn't care so I wasn't

2210
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:16,720
making any money off of him but that's

2211
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:18,340
not what he did emailed her and said

2212
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,960
yeah I don't know what this mat guy's

2213
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,159
told you about me but you know he's kind

2214
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,199
of a [ __ ] and just like completely

2215
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:25,300
buried me to her so not only was I

2216
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:27,579
buried by sub cool then I was buried by

2217
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:30,070
him my own friend it was supposed friend

2218
01:21:27,579 --> 01:21:31,899
at the time and that's when the attitude

2219
01:21:30,069 --> 01:21:33,250
were just they tell you started writing

2220
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:37,199
me nasty emails and I called her a dumb

2221
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:39,850
[ __ ] and that was it end of story

2222
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:41,739
interesting isn't it and so yeah is that

2223
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:43,329
kind of the origins of the whole gage

2224
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:47,800
Greene dispute or does it trace back

2225
01:21:43,329 --> 01:21:50,170
more to a reserve or you know I Jojo was

2226
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:52,119
a friend of mine he was a friend of my

2227
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:54,310
friend NC GA North Cal Growers

2228
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:56,739
Association he's a friend of a lot of

2229
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:58,960
ours and not a lot of us knew the whole

2230
01:21:56,739 --> 01:22:01,599
true story about how he had overdosed

2231
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,430
who who had given him the stuff to

2232
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:06,039
overdose on and where all of his seed

2233
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:07,539
stock went and over time we started to

2234
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:09,399
learn more and more as gage would

2235
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:11,019
[ __ ] let little bits out a little of

2236
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:12,699
its info out and then he'd say oh yeah I

2237
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,620
got this agenda it's like nobody else

2238
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:15,698
had that you didn't pass it on [ __ ]

2239
01:22:14,619 --> 01:22:17,679
you get that you know

2240
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:20,529
a little bit by bit the story would come

2241
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:22,690
out but that was that was almost the end

2242
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:24,519
of our friendship and he did that with

2243
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:25,719
me in Italian I even then I gave him

2244
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,190
another chance I was like dude that was

2245
01:22:25,719 --> 01:22:28,929

2246
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:31,299
her that was a very nice of you I need

2247
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:32,710
to be apologized and then you know a few

2248
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,060
months later I get an email from someone

2249
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:35,500
saying hey this guy's burying you to me

2250
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,940
like you know just random customer I'm

2251
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:39,579
like what you sure

2252
01:22:36,939 --> 01:22:42,189
and he's like yeah yes I hit up HJ what

2253
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:43,630
the dude what are you doing are you okay

2254
01:22:42,189 --> 01:22:45,639
you know like let talk to me what's

2255
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:47,469
going on are you pissed about and then

2256
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,679
you know he'd say no no I'm not doing

2257
01:22:47,469 --> 01:22:49,480
that

2258
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,469
and then eventually happened again and I

2259
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:51,428
confront him he's like yeah you know

2260
01:22:50,469 --> 01:22:53,560
what you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] I don't

2261
01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:55,659
like you and that was it that was it and

2262
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,489
he continued to bury me from then on out

2263
01:22:55,659 --> 01:22:58,899
so I just kind of stayed cool for a

2264
01:22:57,488 --> 01:23:01,718
while I just figured I'd catch him out

2265
01:22:58,899 --> 01:23:03,909
and about slap the [ __ ] out of him calm

2266
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:05,920
them down but he's hard to catch man

2267
01:23:03,909 --> 01:23:09,159
he's hard to catch out of places he runs

2268
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,899
pretty quick yeah that's that's about

2269
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:14,679
where he's at old bald-headed Heisenberg

2270
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:21,579
looking [ __ ] and so I guess the

2271
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:22,810
same thing yeah yeah yeah yeah I didn't

2272
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:23,890
really know them that well I mean I

2273
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,539
didn't give a [ __ ] about their lines

2274
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:26,890
they were working with Brothers Grimm

2275
01:23:25,539 --> 01:23:27,789
stuff which is great Brothers Grimm

2276
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:29,980
already did it and they were just

2277
01:23:27,789 --> 01:23:31,359
rehashing old Brothers Grimm work I

2278
01:23:29,979 --> 01:23:32,859
didn't have any respect for them because

2279
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:34,569
what they didn't Sonny Chiba but at the

2280
01:23:32,859 --> 01:23:35,889
same time I didn't really know them

2281
01:23:34,569 --> 01:23:37,509
personally so I didn't give a [ __ ] to

2282
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:39,940
attack I were saying anything about him

2283
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:42,100
I didn't know them personally but after

2284
01:23:39,939 --> 01:23:44,589
they did that you bet your ass I learned

2285
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:46,150
about him and [ __ ] made sure and

2286
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:48,279
raised hell with them everywhere I could

2287
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:50,289
[ __ ] with my business you [ __ ] with my

2288
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:52,329
livelihood and at the time I was helping

2289
01:23:50,289 --> 01:23:54,399
my grandma who had Alzheimer's [ __ ]

2290
01:23:52,329 --> 01:23:56,559
pay for her her nursing home bill and

2291
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:58,119
that was that was like all my money was

2292
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,830
going to that and they cut into that

2293
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:02,380
hard they made it really hard for me to

2294
01:23:59,829 --> 01:24:04,809
do that so I took that personal and I

2295
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:07,150
still take it personal to this day okay

2296
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:11,530
and some an [ __ ] like that I keep

2297
01:24:07,149 --> 01:24:13,269
grudges and so I mean you mentioned

2298
01:24:11,529 --> 01:24:15,880
heath Robertson in the blood Rosie oh

2299
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:19,210
yeah I think I found a post online where

2300
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:20,980
he says that you know essentially you

2301
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:22,689
initially came to him at some point and

2302
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:25,178
asked for some of his genetics saying

2303
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:26,619
you were gonna be doing a medical type

2304
01:24:25,179 --> 01:24:28,239
project which I think is the one you're

2305
01:24:26,619 --> 01:24:30,159
referencing earlier in the episode

2306
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:32,468
is that yep is that really what happened

2307
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:34,329
or is that no worry just to be right

2308
01:24:32,469 --> 01:24:35,890
when I when I first talked to him that

2309
01:24:34,329 --> 01:24:38,050
was what we talked about and then he

2310
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:40,270
found out I had original Apollo 13 f1

2311
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:41,140
lines from Brothers Grimm and he because

2312
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:43,030
originally he wasn't going to do

2313
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:45,219
anything with me he's like hey dude how

2314
01:24:43,029 --> 01:24:46,539

2315

2318
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,260

2319
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:55,930
intermediary this dude named oh so green

2320
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:57,850

2321
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:59,739

2322
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:03,550

01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:32,719
out of himself over the years actually I

2392
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:34,099
pity the guy but he's never done

2393
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,618
anything bad to me other than top [ __ ]

2394
01:27:34,099 --> 01:27:40,819
and I mean that plant you people do that

2395
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:42,948
I don't mind that yeah okay a lot of

2396
01:27:40,819 --> 01:27:44,358
people who seem to hold a bit of a

2397
01:27:42,948 --> 01:27:46,488
grudge about the comments you made about

2398
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:47,989
outlaw when he was arrested you know in

2399
01:27:46,488 --> 01:27:49,279
the whole that whole situation you know

2400
01:27:47,988 --> 01:27:51,858
would you do anything differently if you

2401
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:53,018
could do that one again what did I say

2402
01:27:51,859 --> 01:27:56,899
he's a piece of [ __ ]

2403
01:27:53,019 --> 01:28:00,199
how long ya know he's still a piece of

2404
01:27:56,899 --> 01:28:00,949
[ __ ] he's a piece of [ __ ] then he's a

2405
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:03,408
piece of [ __ ] now

2406
01:28:00,948 --> 01:28:05,058
I mean sigh I said I specifically said

2407
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:06,648
it sucks when anybody gets arrested for

2408
01:28:05,059 --> 01:28:09,469
this plan I don't wish that on anyone

2409
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:10,669
but the guy's a [ __ ] so I mean I

2410
01:28:09,469 --> 01:28:11,929
don't have any sympathy for him I'm

2411
01:28:10,668 --> 01:28:13,099
risking the same [ __ ] everybody's

2412
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:15,168
risking the same [ __ ] we all know what

2413
01:28:13,099 --> 01:28:17,510
we're risking especially back then you

2414
01:28:15,168 --> 01:28:18,948
know it wouldn't have made me any less

2415
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:20,329
of a jerk I don't know why it would make

2416
01:28:18,948 --> 01:28:22,698
him any less of a jerk so now he'll know

2417
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:25,308
I wouldn't change anything yeah okay and

2418
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:29,569
so I guess maybe a question tie up this

2419
01:28:25,309 --> 01:28:32,059
little segment the current the current

2420
01:28:29,569 --> 01:28:34,038
cannabis community would largely be

2421
01:28:32,059 --> 01:28:36,260
described on Instagram at least is you

2422
01:28:34,038 --> 01:28:37,759
know full of drama and backstabbing and

2423
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:39,769
things like that do you feel like this

2424
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,659
is an accurate statement or do you feel

2425
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:44,780
like there's always been ongoing dramas

2426
01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:46,458
and feuds there's I mean [ __ ] I mean for

2427
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:48,139
me there's always been ongoing drums and

2428
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:49,908
feuds but I'm one of the few people who

2429
01:28:48,139 --> 01:28:51,800
will snap back at people or say anything

2430
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:53,179
I mean you don't see bode and a lot of

2431
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,099
dramas or feuds you don't see I mean

2432
01:28:53,179 --> 01:28:55,760
there's it doesn't really happen to him

2433
01:28:55,099 --> 01:28:57,288
but

2434
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,300
because he's so [ __ ] nice and he's

2435
01:28:57,288 --> 01:29:01,069
hard to get ahold of to people but I'm

2436
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:03,860
not I try to be really accessible and

2437
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:05,448
and that's that's been a hard part of it

2438
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:07,399
as far as Instagram goes though like I

2439
01:29:05,448 --> 01:29:08,569
mean have you seen my Instagram I mostly

2440
01:29:07,399 --> 01:29:11,929
post pictures or records there's a

2441
01:29:08,569 --> 01:29:15,380
reason for that people are [ __ ] on

2442
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:16,550
there yeah so yeah I mean it's just

2443
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,500
getting worse because there's a lot more

2444
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:19,610
people involved in the scene I mean back

2445
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,010
then there were probably a hundred of us

2446
01:29:19,609 --> 01:29:23,210
now there's tens of thousands of people

2447
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:24,530
calling themselves breeders and it's

2448
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:26,599
just worse and worse every day

2449
01:29:24,529 --> 01:29:29,899
and they're all a little back biters

2450
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:30,260
like your groomer Grover whatever his

2451
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:33,618
name is

2452
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:35,630
yeah yeah yeah he's I mean he's all up

2453
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,768
in that [ __ ] you know all those guys the

2454
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:39,440
only reason I know their names this cuz

2455
01:29:36,769 --> 01:29:41,090
all the [ __ ] caught but you know more

2456
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:42,828
power to him it makes him happy through

2457
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:48,769
if that's the way they want to spend

2458
01:29:42,828 --> 01:29:51,259
their time and so you know all the

2459
01:29:48,769 --> 01:29:53,659
previous questions i I've kind of

2460
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:55,969
questioned in my mind how come you don't

2461
01:29:53,658 --> 01:29:57,649
have any gorilla glue hybrids it it

2462
01:29:55,969 --> 01:29:59,420
seems like a strain you'd breed with but

2463
01:29:57,649 --> 01:30:01,549
I couldn't seem to see any easier no

2464
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:04,309
miss decision yeah that was a conscious

2465
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:06,590
decision one one being that my friend

2466
01:30:04,309 --> 01:30:08,029
Jason from dark horse he has he went out

2467
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:10,659
of his way to make sure and get the

2468
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:13,009
right the right rights from the breeder

2469
01:30:10,658 --> 01:30:15,768
so be the one who worked with it and

2470
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:18,469
Jason worked hard to do that and I

2471
01:30:15,769 --> 01:30:19,849
respect that and I'd not gonna step on

2472
01:30:18,469 --> 01:30:23,210
his toes he's one of my friends you know

2473
01:30:19,849 --> 01:30:25,038
announced that was pretty much it okay

2474
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:29,750
I'm help I'm helping him make the S once

2475
01:30:25,038 --> 01:30:31,759
in a way right now so I mean I mean it's

2476
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:33,078
there's work but it's not it's not my

2477
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,230
hands-on work and it's originally going

2478
01:30:33,078 --> 01:30:38,359
to be but now it's just mostly

2479
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:39,529
advisement on how to make the S ones and

2480
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:41,359
so how do you feel about all the other

2481
01:30:39,529 --> 01:30:43,130
brands who are 4s ones all that you know

2482
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:46,219
given that information we've just learnt

2483
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:47,690
about the exclusivity rights I mean

2484
01:30:46,219 --> 01:30:48,920
that's up to them if they want to do

2485
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:50,448
that or not if they want to make friends

2486
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,940
or they want to make enemies that's up

2487
01:30:50,448 --> 01:30:54,319
to them you know I just don't stab my

2488
01:30:52,939 --> 01:30:55,518
friends in the back and if they're not

2489
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,569
friends with him and they think that's

2490
01:30:55,519 --> 01:31:00,590
okay then that's up to them but I mean

2491
01:30:58,569 --> 01:31:02,389
Jason there's a lot of friends he has a

2492
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:04,460
lot of friends like me then I have a lot

2493
01:31:02,389 --> 01:31:07,519
of friends and it just all backfires

2494
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:09,020
eventually I mean that's up to them yeah

2495
01:31:07,519 --> 01:31:11,449
okay

2496
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:13,520
and so do you ever have do you ever want

2497
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:15,500
to get any of your lines and try to take

2498
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,620
them to like a true breeding point like

2499
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:21,770
maybe an extended the ex project or you

2500
01:31:18,619 --> 01:31:23,539
know some kind of IPO the right berries

2501
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:26,210
already at that staged where it's true

2502
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:27,859
breeding and that's all the crosses we

2503
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:29,689
are making with it now are from the true

2504
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:32,229
breeding stance that's why almost every

2505
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:36,139
right berry crosses purple and blueberry

2506
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:37,579
relation to that f7 the right very mated

2507
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:39,289
to f7 and that's where I stopped it

2508
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:40,760
because that was any anything further

2509
01:31:39,289 --> 01:31:47,289
than that it was just not doing anything

2510
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:49,760
extra to the line mmm as far as IBL

2511
01:31:47,289 --> 01:31:51,739
that's that's quite a heavy undertaking

2512
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,930
I I don't know any IPL's that are true

2513
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:55,609
IPL's deep chunk maybe but even that has

2514
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:57,950
a green phenotype in a purple phenotype

2515
01:31:55,609 --> 01:32:01,329
which means it's not a true IBL trying

2516
01:31:57,949 --> 01:32:04,699
to get an IPL in cannabis is is not I

2517
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:06,890
can't say it's not achievable but I've

2518
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:09,710
never seen it [ __ ] happen any

2519
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:11,300
anywhere so in trying to do that I mean

2520
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:14,810
I don't know I don't know if I want to

2521
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:18,920
go down that path of frustration yeah

2522
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:21,920
okay and when you grow just for personal

2523
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:23,420
use are you like more of a few strains

2524
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,609
like you get in some variety or you're

2525
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:27,560
just like a 102 strains oh I know I

2526
01:32:25,609 --> 01:32:30,259
always have a lot of variety and I for a

2527
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:33,050
lot of Southeast Asians for myself okay

2528
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:34,489
so what are some of your favorites the

2529
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:38,000
right bear line would be one it's mostly

2530
01:32:34,489 --> 01:32:40,099
tied dominant the original Santa Cruz

2531
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:44,300
Blue Dream again tie dominant it's just

2532
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:46,579
because that that works with my my my

2533
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:50,239
chemical my chemical body type you know

2534
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:52,010
it just it's happy stuff and indicas

2535
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:55,849
tend to depress me and make me depressed

2536
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:57,949
and anxious Hayes's don't really make me

2537
01:32:55,850 --> 01:33:00,320
anxious but they I don't know just it's

2538
01:32:57,949 --> 01:33:03,529
not my thing it's very specific to the

2539
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:05,659
Southeast Asian stuff myself yeah okay

2540
01:33:03,529 --> 01:33:08,630
and so if you can only name one what's

2541
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:10,760
your favorite strain mmm for personal

2542
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:12,710
smoke it would be the right very

2543
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,590
definitely it's not too heavy it doesn't

2544
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:16,069
end day in my day cuz I you know we're

2545
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:19,340
out of business

2546
01:33:16,069 --> 01:33:22,219
stay awake yeah that's what I tend to

2547
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:22,850
like to do and so would you consider the

2548
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:24,619
riot bear

2549
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:27,380
all the clockwork orange' to be more

2550
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:30,380
kind of you know the thing that comes to

2551
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:31,730
mind when people think of riot seeds you

2552
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,930
know I think everybody associates a

2553
01:33:31,729 --> 01:33:34,219
clockwork orange' with us just because

2554
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:36,560
it's been around the longest it's the

2555
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:38,539
rarest the clones it mean it sells for

2556
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,660
20 grand a shot you know and that's

2557
01:33:38,539 --> 01:33:43,250
that's always been a big thing with us

2558
01:33:40,659 --> 01:33:45,019
okay for a while I had the record in

2559
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:48,470
California is selling for 500 an ounce

2560
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:50,000
like constantly and in never going for

2561
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:52,430
under that and it was only sold by the

2562
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,159
ounces never sold by the pound so yeah

2563
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:56,119
it had a lot of really special things to

2564
01:33:55,159 --> 01:33:58,639
it associated with it

2565
01:33:56,119 --> 01:34:00,890
I wish right Barry would probably be

2566
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:03,079
more popular session with us because I

2567
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:04,579
did more work with it and worked harder

2568
01:34:03,079 --> 01:34:06,470
on it and I think a cheap or

2569
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:07,880
interbreeding standpoint but I think

2570
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:10,880
overall Clockwork Orange is probably

2571
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:12,800
associated with this more okay and

2572
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,449
what's what's like the an upcoming

2573
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:18,739
project that you personally really

2574
01:34:14,449 --> 01:34:20,929
excited for um I do want to do more work

2575
01:34:18,739 --> 01:34:23,119
with our plant and banana I mean there's

2576
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:25,460
only been released maybe a few times we

2577
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,739
did the be it the s1 a few times and we

2578
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:30,800
did the BX one project but there's a lot

2579
01:34:27,739 --> 01:34:32,149
more to do with that yeah there's a lot

2580
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,310
more to do with that I've been really

2581
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:37,159
stoked with the East Coast our diesel

2582
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:38,660
strawberry cream cross using that and a

2583
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:41,840
bunch of lines because it's just it's

2584
01:34:38,659 --> 01:34:44,689
like it's it's been really reliable at

2585
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:46,369
all of its out processes being keepers

2586
01:34:44,689 --> 01:34:48,229
to someone at some point they're all

2587
01:34:46,369 --> 01:34:51,170
really phenomenal and that was kind of a

2588
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:53,419
surprise because diesel is very picky

2589
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:55,100
and usually not predictable but the

2590
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:56,869
strawberry cream cross to it for some

2591
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:59,079
reason gave it a lot more predictability

2592
01:34:56,869 --> 01:35:02,029
and it was pretty amazing

2593
01:34:59,079 --> 01:35:03,590
yeah okay and so what's one of the

2594
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:05,389
strains that you know if you only pick

2595
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:07,069
one that you'd really love to get back

2596
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:09,490
in your library that's been lost either

2597
01:35:07,069 --> 01:35:14,929
by you personally or just everyone oh

2598
01:35:09,489 --> 01:35:16,789
god that's a hard one san diego purple

2599
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:18,890
train wreck was really good it was a

2600
01:35:16,789 --> 01:35:21,050
specific cut a purple train wreck of and

2601
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:22,910
this is before DNA was releasing their

2602
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:24,850
purple train or whatever the [ __ ] they

2603
01:35:22,909 --> 01:35:27,050
called it it was just a cross from there

2604
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:28,610
and it was just really good had to say

2605
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:31,039
it always had like that tight tie pie

2606
01:35:28,609 --> 01:35:34,159
from the train wreck side but it was

2607
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:35,988
just really really really happy and if

2608
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:38,599
you smoke the resin from it

2609
01:35:35,988 --> 01:35:39,919
it would if you smoked enough of it it

2610
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,130
would give you almost like tracers like

2611
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,940
acid has and that was really cool okay

2612
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:47,150
interesting

2613
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:48,859
yeah and so I mean you mentioned earlier

2614
01:35:47,149 --> 01:35:50,238
before selling clones you're one of the

2615
01:35:48,859 --> 01:35:52,579
few readers who I've seen you know

2616
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:53,659
openly kind of selling clones do you

2617
01:35:52,579 --> 01:35:55,010
feel that something the other breeders

2618
01:35:53,659 --> 01:35:56,359
should do or is it just something you're

2619
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:59,150
just kind of taking advantage of because

2620
01:35:56,359 --> 01:36:05,179
no one else is no one should do it no

2621
01:35:59,149 --> 01:36:06,710
hell no nobody should do that [ __ ] no I

2622
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:09,619
mean like there's been times very like

2623
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:10,939
like where I was moving and I packed up

2624
01:36:09,619 --> 01:36:12,920
my whole room like five times over

2625
01:36:10,939 --> 01:36:14,539
excited want to lose anything and I had

2626
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,920
a lot of [ __ ] leftover Canadian lose a

2627
01:36:14,539 --> 01:36:16,880
single plant and I was like oh my god

2628
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,469
what the [ __ ] am I gonna do with all

2629
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,760
this well so I was like oh well I'll

2630
01:36:18,469 --> 01:36:20,810
just put up some for sale and if any

2631
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,860
breeders want to get a hold of this

2632
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:24,410
stuff that they would normally wouldn't

2633
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:25,849
even have a shot at getting and I got a

2634
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:27,738
lot of good responses from that so now

2635
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:28,969
when people see like that I'm working

2636
01:36:27,738 --> 01:36:30,529
with something they'll make me an offer

2637
01:36:28,969 --> 01:36:31,899
on what you know whatever they think

2638
01:36:30,529 --> 01:36:33,829
it's worth and if I think it's worth

2639
01:36:31,899 --> 01:36:35,059
sending it to him for that amount and

2640
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:36,979
going through the hassle of hook and

2641
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:39,650
shipping and all that [ __ ] then we'll do

2642
01:36:36,979 --> 01:36:41,449
it if not that it won't but yeah it's

2643
01:36:39,649 --> 01:36:42,738
cool though I mean I don't see a lot of

2644
01:36:41,449 --> 01:36:43,939
breeders doing that because a lot of

2645
01:36:42,738 --> 01:36:47,599
breeders are working with stuff you can

2646
01:36:43,939 --> 01:36:49,219
go buy a collective so so I mean how do

2647
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,110
you feel about the whole concept of kind

2648
01:36:49,219 --> 01:36:53,539
of like you know I'm not gonna say clone

2649
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:55,189
hoarding but like you know really not

2650
01:36:53,539 --> 01:36:56,719
giving coins out to many people at all

2651
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:58,849
do you feel like that's more positive

2652
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:01,219
than it is negative or it's just you

2653
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:03,110
know I used to be really really

2654
01:37:01,219 --> 01:37:04,850
stringent about that I mean if someone

2655
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:06,109
asked me like don't pass this out it

2656
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:07,700
never goes out and that's just the way

2657
01:37:06,109 --> 01:37:09,880
it is I mean that's why I have the

2658
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:12,949
connections that I do I never break that

2659
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:14,630
but at the same time I you know

2660
01:37:12,949 --> 01:37:16,670
clockwork orange' I kept that back from

2661
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:18,170
so many people and I've almost lost it

2662
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,520
so many times that I was like okay this

2663
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:21,980
is getting kind of ridiculous I'm gonna

2664
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,750
end up losing this just out of greed so

2665
01:37:21,979 --> 01:37:26,629
now I stopped doing all that [ __ ] just

2666
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:29,890
for my own personal [ __ ] it's it's too

2667
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:32,690
easy to lose [ __ ] that way yeah okay and

2668
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:37,840
so out of all the strains you've tried

2669
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:40,279
over the years what's the worst oh God

2670
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:43,779
probably something I made and it was a

2671
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:45,859
it was a it was de shaman's purple widow

2672
01:37:43,779 --> 01:37:47,539
and it was it was just like I was

2673
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:49,460
[ __ ] around with autoflowering [ __ ]

2674
01:37:47,539 --> 01:37:52,189
at the time for no reason it was just

2675
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:54,289
see what would happen crossed lowrider

2676
01:37:52,189 --> 01:37:55,849
and it was the worst [ __ ] I've ever seen

2677
01:37:54,289 --> 01:37:57,350
in my life did you shave him purple

2678
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:58,850
widow in the first place Auto flowered

2679
01:37:57,350 --> 01:38:00,710
and it shouldn't have made any seeds but

2680
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:02,810
I see three leftover nuts okay I'll try

2681
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:05,779
this [ __ ] it was terrible it was [ __ ]

2682
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:07,580
four it was as bad as any like brick

2683
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:10,250
schwag I've ever seen and I was

2684
01:38:07,579 --> 01:38:12,469
responsible for that madness that was

2685
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:14,270
the worst strain effort so I mean like

2686
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:15,800
just touching on lowrider how do you

2687
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:18,410
feel about autos is it something you'd

2688
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,449
ever look into or no I did it a long

2689
01:38:18,409 --> 01:38:21,889
time ago I released a few lines but it

2690
01:38:20,449 --> 01:38:23,269
was only because I was trying to fill a

2691
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:25,310
void in the market in the American

2692
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:27,020
market and really I don't I wasn't happy

2693
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:28,489
with any of the I mean they're okay

2694
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:31,310
people were happy with them that grew

2695
01:38:28,488 --> 01:38:32,479
them but I I mean real growers aren't

2696
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:34,130
gonna be happy with that they grow real

2697
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:35,659
strains it's just not it's never gonna

2698
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:38,390
be the same or equal as long as you're

2699
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:40,909
losing ruderalis but if I was like an

2700
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:42,230
aspiring breeder nowadays and I really

2701
01:38:40,909 --> 01:38:46,488
wanted to learn how to breed and watch

2702
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:48,289
selection and and and how progeny comes

2703
01:38:46,488 --> 01:38:49,929
out I would I would advise someone go

2704
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:52,399
get some regular autoflowering seeds

2705
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:55,280
because they have a very short cycle and

2706
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:57,319
you can see selection and evolution in

2707
01:38:55,279 --> 01:38:59,210
action a lot faster than you would using

2708
01:38:57,319 --> 01:39:01,729
a normal line just to learn how

2709
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:03,800
outcrossing works learning selecting

2710
01:39:01,729 --> 01:39:05,389
traits etc etc that's what it's good for

2711
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:07,699
is training someone how to do that and

2712
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:09,320
that's about it with that [ __ ] and of

2713
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:11,090
course like Europeans that have to grow

2714
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:14,000
in like little tiny apartments I mean

2715
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:15,770
I'm sure they're good for that yeah

2716
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,050
so I mean you mentioned earlier that

2717
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:20,360
like s wanting a coin only can be like a

2718
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:22,310
good way to retain the genetics improve

2719
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:25,219
the vigor and things lost over the years

2720
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:27,500
do you like there's any other ways to

2721
01:39:25,219 --> 01:39:29,060
improve the you know the traits that

2722
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:32,329
have been lost over the years or you

2723
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:34,070
just have to want it so to speak no I

2724
01:39:32,329 --> 01:39:35,988
mean you can also tissue culture I mean

2725
01:39:34,069 --> 01:39:36,979
but that's not it does not necessary

2726
01:39:35,988 --> 01:39:38,149
through breeding it's just tissue

2727
01:39:36,979 --> 01:39:42,079
culturing you can get a lot of the

2728
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:43,670
vigour back I use a lot s wanting if I'm

2729
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:46,309
not using it just to make seeds I use it

2730
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:47,930
for a lot for parental identification to

2731
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:49,430
see what other phenotypes are that the

2732
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:51,789
parents would have put out in order to

2733
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:55,159
guess the parental parentage of a line

2734
01:39:51,789 --> 01:39:56,539
that's also a good good use of it but

2735
01:39:55,159 --> 01:39:57,738
yeah I mean like if you're getting a

2736
01:39:56,539 --> 01:39:59,869
figure back to a plant the only things

2737
01:39:57,738 --> 01:40:01,579
you can really do are s wanting it out

2738
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:03,139
crossing in selecting for a phenotype

2739
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:05,090
and then stabilize in that tray

2740
01:40:03,139 --> 01:40:08,389
through a successful Brewers excessive

2741
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:11,960
breeding or through yeah it's funny

2742
01:40:08,389 --> 01:40:13,400
that's it okay and so is teacher

2743
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:14,929
culturing something you're doing at the

2744
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:17,868
moment or looking into or you think it's

2745
01:40:14,929 --> 01:40:20,480
kind of just more of a dream we did it

2746
01:40:17,868 --> 01:40:21,889
early on very early on very very early

2747
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:22,368
on before anybody was like selling kits

2748
01:40:21,889 --> 01:40:24,739
or anything

2749
01:40:22,368 --> 01:40:26,599
it was very [ __ ] hard to do because

2750
01:40:24,738 --> 01:40:28,729
we did it in a normal house without a

2751
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:31,190
[ __ ] fume hood without any kind of

2752
01:40:28,729 --> 01:40:32,899
HEPA filtration system and it was not

2753
01:40:31,189 --> 01:40:35,539
very successful I mean it was very very

2754
01:40:32,899 --> 01:40:37,069
little success with it and every time

2755
01:40:35,539 --> 01:40:39,889
I've tried it since it's been similar

2756
01:40:37,069 --> 01:40:41,210
spotty stuff I have friends that have

2757
01:40:39,889 --> 01:40:43,159
done it successfully without all that

2758
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:46,158
stuff and I don't know how they did that

2759
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:49,579
they must have insanely Anil OCD

2760
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:52,158
cleaning abilities and not I've wearing

2761
01:40:49,579 --> 01:40:54,198
masks and [ __ ] but I think it's a great

2762
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:55,609
thing to do I just you really need a lab

2763
01:40:54,198 --> 01:41:00,229
setting to be able to do it successfully

2764
01:40:55,609 --> 01:41:02,238
and make it reliable yeah and so we see

2765
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:04,399
like you know these kits where you can

2766
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:06,618
take little cuttings of Leafs of little

2767
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:08,420
seedlings and and get determine their

2768
01:41:06,618 --> 01:41:10,819
sex and stuff like that do you think

2769
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:12,679
that this rise in kind of our use of

2770
01:41:10,819 --> 01:41:14,059
scientific tools and techniques is going

2771
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:15,380
to continue to rise or they're just like

2772
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:18,070
kind of been moving fad and will always

2773
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:20,359
do things kind of the way we have I

2774
01:41:18,069 --> 01:41:22,158
don't know I think I really do think the

2775
01:41:20,359 --> 01:41:23,599
tissue culturing is going to be the the

2776
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:25,670
ideal way the future I mean it could

2777
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,880
store so many samples in such a small

2778
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:31,340
area with much less light I mean it is

2779
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,989
the ideal method as long as you have a

2780
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:35,989
clean space but it's happened to

2781
01:41:32,988 --> 01:41:38,149
filtration and lab lab settings get

2782
01:41:35,988 --> 01:41:39,138
cheaper you know you'll probably see

2783
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:42,500
people weren't doing that more than

2784
01:41:39,139 --> 01:41:44,300
cloning but that's right now I mean

2785
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:46,158
cloning is just so easy to do that I

2786
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:51,020
don't see that changing in the near

2787
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:53,960
future yeah of course and so a lucky

2788
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:56,330
last question if you could go and get

2789
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,310
one oh sorry if you're gonna get some

2790
01:41:56,329 --> 01:42:00,039
land rice seeds from one period of time

2791
01:41:58,310 --> 01:42:06,289
from any region where would it be oh

2792
01:42:00,039 --> 01:42:09,800
that's a good one but I would like to go

2793
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:14,539
back to to China during some of the

2794
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:17,000
earliest earliest mmm like man's

2795
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:18,979
earliest work with cannabis

2796
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,659
harvesting it and growing it and the

2797
01:42:18,979 --> 01:42:22,099
first early selection seven see what it

2798
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:24,619
really looked like I mean there's a lot

2799
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:26,840
of guesses on whether it was a broadleaf

2800
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:30,649
indica type plant or whether it was a

2801
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:33,440
narrow leaf plant when what exact value

2802
01:42:30,649 --> 01:42:34,670
was from and what it was like what it's

2803
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:36,889
early trade sure like that would that

2804
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:38,720
would probably be be the ultimate dreams

2805
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:40,220
to see what the the first cannabis plant

2806
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:42,400
looked like before it went all around

2807
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:44,810
the world and changed its looking form

2808
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:47,210
yeah interesting and so sorry just

2809
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:49,700
clarify the the kind of the cradle of

2810
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:51,380
life is in China you think yeah that's

2811
01:42:49,699 --> 01:42:54,529
that's that's been the scientific

2812
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:57,489
hypothesis since the 70s yeah fantastic

2813
01:42:54,529 --> 01:43:01,819
like I guess near the mountains maybe or

2814
01:42:57,489 --> 01:43:03,199
yeah or the Golden Triangle I think okay

2815
01:43:01,819 --> 01:43:05,539
I think it's you especially that or like

2816
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:07,579
the the yeah I think the Chinese Union

2817
01:43:05,539 --> 01:43:09,289
mountains there's some some people would

2818
01:43:07,579 --> 01:43:11,269
say that but I think the Golden Triangle

2819
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:15,199
is also another place that it could be

2820
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:16,430
so yeah yeah interesting awesome we I

2821
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:18,289
think that just about brings us to the

2822
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:21,590
end of it was there any shot at comments

2823
01:43:18,289 --> 01:43:23,810
you wanted to make no I think I already

2824
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:26,539
talked about everyone that's it's been

2825
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:27,680
really awesome everyone else that helped

2826
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:31,460
me along the way on right seeds thank

2827
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:33,440
you and yeah that's it also more things

2828
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:35,770
mark on the show today man all right

2829
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:35,769
thank you

2830
01:43:37,409 --> 01:43:46,859
so what do you think

2831
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:49,800
you like my Lorna I think I do hope you

2832
01:43:46,859 --> 01:43:53,039
had a good time and thanks again to get

2833
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:54,750
a garden solutions for 20 Australia and

2834
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:55,680
most importantly Matt right and right

2835
01:43:54,750 --> 01:44:25,010
seeds

2836
