138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,439
locations I've moved around all over the

139
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,039
place from Maryland to South Carolina to

how would you describe the state of the

149
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,519
East Coast scene at the moment the

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,479
impression I get is that it's sort of

151
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,758
booming and going through a bit of a a

152
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,918
boom phase how would you describe it

153
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,160
it's incredible honestly I've had some

154
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,000
of the best flower in the world in New

155

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,639
year the scene there is incredible it

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,879

158
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,639
Barcelona or the coffee shops over in

159
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,918
Amsterdam except a little bit more wax

160

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,598
in a lounge with you know a little

168
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,199
coffee bar food vendor tables everywhere

169
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,598
couches just it it's phenomenal they

170
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,120
really really have something special

171
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,959
going on I'll say Virginia as well is

172
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,120
really really doing big things so which

173
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:35,198
is a state I never really associated

174
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,160
with ever having legal cannabis um they

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,960
were always I got arrested in Richmond

176
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,240
Virginia when I was like 18 years old

177
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,638
for weed so that's a place that I never

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,960
ever thought would would Boom the way it

179
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,759
has but yeah then again when I was 21

180
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,799
years old so yeah Virginia I've had a

181
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,598
shady past with as far as that's

182
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,280
concerned but some of the best weed I

183
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,519
actually ever smoked was um I used to

184
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,719
have a business that or a job that would

185
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,198
take me on the road over

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,840
would stay in a hotel in this little

187
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,478
college town in Virginia and the the

188
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,119
girl at the front desk of this hotel

189
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,519
eventually became friends I'd be there

190
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,720
every other week and eventually asked

191
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,000
you know you want to come smoke some

192
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,639
weed or whatever and she was like yeah

193
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,918
sure and one time I didn't have any and

194
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,840
I was like you know where I could like

195
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,359
get some and she was like yeah my my

196
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,239
husband come come over to our house and

197
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,680
I went over and it was like the first

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,439
time I ever had fresh homegrown and it

199
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,879
was just like a game changer I was like

200
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,199
oh my God it was White Widow and still

201
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,599
to this day it was like some of the best

202
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,759
flowers I've ever had in my life so yeah

203
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,719
Virginia and I have a and cannabis have

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,319
a nice little LoveHate relationship um

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,639
but yeah the east coast is is doing

206
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,879
great things I can't wait for the rest

207
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,079
of it to open

208
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,158
up yeah totally what what a cool story

209
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,079
you know from Virginia and and white

210
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:51,639
widow what a brilliant sort of uh like

211
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,000
kind bud introduction to have I'm sure

212
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,400
that was epic out of curiosity have you

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,360
ever been tempted to to pick up a pack

214
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,038
of White Widow from somewhere and Chase

215
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,000
that Holy Grail

216
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,839
I really want to try the the Sharon

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,879
White Widow that's around it's um you

218
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,560
know I haven't asked anybody for it in a

219
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,319
few years I I I used to reach out to

220
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,000
breeders all the time and people that I

221
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,800
looked up to and tried to like let it be

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,478
known you know I'm not out here to rip

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
anybody off or do anything shady I'd

224
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,519
love to like try some of this even if

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,319
it's just a flower not necessarily

226
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,758
getting a cutter anything like that and

227
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,960
um yeah just never had any luck and it's

228
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,280
weird the way this has kind of

229
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,679
progressed

230
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,000
um I remember in-house genetics maybe

231
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,759
2015 2016 reaching out and being like

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,200
man I'd love to like collab on an auto

233
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,278
flower and he was just kind of you know

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
maybe one day maybe one day and just

235
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,879
last year he reached out to me I was

236
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,278
like man I'd love to collab on an auto

237
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,240
flower and I was like [ __ ] yeah dude all

238
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,439
right that's awesome let's do it so I

239
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,000
sent him some poen he made the seeds I'm

240
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
not sure if he's got those going quite

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
yet but he sent me pictures of the seeds

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,160
a couple months ago so yeah it's a a

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,440
weird turn of events the way Auto

244
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,719
flowers have kind of started to be more

245
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,040
recognized by the photo period world and

246
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,519
people are starting to understand that

247
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,159
they do have a place in

248
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,759
this yeah totally totally out of

249
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,759
curiosity are you willing to let out of

250
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,120
the bag which uh which pollen did you

251
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,919
send him and and if you could just pick

252
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,600
a couple hybrids you'd love to see made

253
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,719
out of his Library what what's on the

254
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,560
radar for

255
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,959
you um I believe I sent him the crinkled

256
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,559
cookies feminized poin and I think I

257
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,518
also sent him some wizards of ress

258
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,559
feminized pollen and I think it was the

259
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
crinkled cookies that he ended up using

260
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:39,919
and I'm pretty sure he used it

261
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,639
to um maybe a slurricane i he had a

262
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,078
something black cherry um I'd have to

263
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,480
look at my notes to to see exactly what

264
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:50,278
what he was going to use on that but I

265
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,120
had made a cross with the the slur cane

266
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:57,078
cut that was floating around back in

267
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,120
2019 or so maybe 2018 and it was the

268
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,479
first time and the only time that I

269
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,759
think I've ever had a plant that was

270
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,680
duding as what it was called back then

271
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,720
now I think it's you know

272
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,120
hlvd um but yeah it just kind of died

273
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,800
just kind of stopped midflower and so

274
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,399
those seeds that seed stock I just set

275
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,838
aside and never touched again because I

276
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,639
didn't ever want to reintroduce that or

277
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,920
like grow anything that had that vroid

278
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,759
and possibly contaminate other stuff so

279
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,120
I still have that seed stock locked away

280
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,039
separate from from everything else just

281
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,078
you know maybe for for future reference

282
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,799
someday but um sorry I forgot what the

283
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,559
question was you you answered it which

284
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,679
which hybrids would you like to see and

285
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,119
and you know it San would be a great

286
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:42,159
pairing I'm I'm a fan of it for sure and

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,240
you just mentioned HL the hopl en vroid

288
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,958
and the thing that you just stimulated

289
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,480
in my mind was an interesting thought

290
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,638
right you often hear about it in the

291
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,120
context of clones cuz they sort of pick

292
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,799
it up and then it's just in there you

293
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,039
really don't hear about it with ordos

294
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:59,039
and then I guess it got me thinking have

295
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,000
you seen plants with what you suspect

296
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,439
not necessarily your own but just via

297
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,039
other people Auto plants that have it

298
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,959
and and how does it manifest like is it

299
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,319
cuz I guess I'm wondering would it just

300
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,078
be like lower yield and stuff like that

301
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,959
or or would it maybe stress the plant in

302
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,359
a way that's like you know how sometimes

303
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,199
the auto will just like stop growing and

304
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,240
just go into flower at like this really

305
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,399
small stage have you have you seen any

306
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,799
Autos infected and what was the symptoms

307
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,519
looking

308
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:31,240
like I really haven't uh none that I've

309
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,240
been aware of um

310
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,440
um we were just speaking again before

311
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,638
the interview and I have seen some seed

312
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
stock going around from from other

313
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,959
people that um the plants are just kind

314
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,799
of stunned and inch or Too Tall

315
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,559
consistently across the board all with a

316
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,639
certain seed stock and so I've seen

317
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,199
people say you know have these been

318
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,000
tested for you know the hot platon vroid

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,639
or anything but I really can't say that

320
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,958
I've ever seen it in Autos before but

321
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
that's not to say that it isn't out

322
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,799
there I pretty much just stick to my own

323
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,159
stuff stuff that I'm familiar with stock

324
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,519
that I've had for the past decade or

325
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,199
more at this point so um yeah I I can't

326
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,078
say that I've ever actually seen it for

327
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,480
sure other than the one time where I

328
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,198
think I got the dirty clone of the

329
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,320
slur yeah fair enough fair enough and I

330
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,399
was thinking like it it's actually an

331
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,760
interesting question in that like who

332
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,399
knows maybe maybe in some sense Autos

333
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,759
are less prone to hopl and viroid I mean

334
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,480
obviously there's the literal aspect of

335
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,759
they they're not really cloned so they

336
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,399
don't stay around long enough um but

337
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,720
also maybe there's some other sort of

338
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,958
underlying genetic trait associated with

339
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,639
being an auto that who knows it's a

340
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,879
interesting one to ponder but uh to get

341
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,440
us back on track I wanted to quickly ask

342
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,320
you cuz a question I've wanted to ask

343
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,760
you for a long time CU you're the man to

344
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,360
answer it is in your mind what has been

345
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,399
the most impressive autof flower you've

346
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,159
ever tried do you remember like that

347
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,120
moment where you were like wow this is

348
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,120
it

349
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,760
h i mean I have some favorites for sure

350
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,600
I think to me the most

351
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,600
impressive thing that that I've ever

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,720
come across with

353
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
[Music]

354
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,839
them my my older brother and some of his

355
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,600
friends were my toughest critics and for

356
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,959
a long time you know I I started growing

357
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,519
then I found out some of his friends

358
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,399
were growing and they had some flones

359
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,159
and and stuff that I really wanted to

360
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,399
work with and it took me a few years of

361
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:35,600
growing autos and playing with Autos to

362
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,360
get to a point where they used to claim

363
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,519
you know we can taste the auto flow in

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
this and I was like well what does it

365
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,240
taste like can you explain to me what

366
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,600
the auto trait tastes like and they

367
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,680
could never really Express that um but

368
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,079
eventually I grew some stuff and they

369
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,278
were like wow this is amazing and I was

370
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,758
like that's an auto and they're like

371
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,600
this is this I was like yeah that's an

372
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,320
auto and at that point they let me have

373
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,399
access to a subcool clone of space dog

374
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,399
which is like the thing that growing up

375
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,759
in in kind of my circle was like the end

376
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,519
all be all top tier clone of that time

377
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,039
and they let me use that and I worked

378
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,720
with it and came back to them years

379
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:14,919
later with the flower from it and the

380
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,519
dude that that held that cut smoked it

381
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,599
and was just like this is the space dog

382
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,720
like you did it and I that was like kind

383
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,320
of the high water mark of like I know

384
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,120
I'm on the right path here I know this

385
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,600
can be done it just takes the the proper

386
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,759
work the selections and like you know

387
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,320
just just understanding kind of the

388
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,399
plants and what you're selecting for so

389
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,240
that was like the first one of those and

390
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,120
then again with the the zomo Delica

391
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Express is one that I'm super proud of

392
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,720
and you know really really nice true

393
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,839
sativa and Autoflower format that's just

394
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,680
super uplifting and heavy and um now the

395
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,759
the the sour diesel stuff that I've been

396
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,799
working on here recently are some of the

397
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,600
stinkiest Autos I've ever come across

398
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,639
hands down so I mean there's a few

399
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,000
different kind of high water mark along

400
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,919
the the journey here but um as far as

401
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,159
pinpointing any one specific moment I

402
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,360
mean there's there's it just kind of

403
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,600
continues to evolve every couple years

404
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,120
there's something new that's just like

405
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,920
damn I can't believe like this worked

406
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,519
so yeah that's that's really an

407
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,039
interesting point you raised there I

408
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,759
mean the people will hate me if I don't

409
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,240
ask you know there's a million in one

410
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,000
sour cuts out there which ones do you

411
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,198
like and uh which one have you used in

412
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,480
the project

413
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:35,120
so in this one I used the AJ Sour Diesel

414
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,759
and I've currently got the Albany Sour

415
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,759
Diesel skunk Tech choco um got one from

416
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,639
a gentleman Clon soprano who people say

417
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,680
is like the real the real true Sour

418
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,839
Diesel but I mean nowadays they have

419
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,638
sour competitions every single year to

420
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,920
see who has the real Sour and it's like

421
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,560
there is no kind of one real Sour

422
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,318
anymore and people say you know the AJ

423
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,958
Sour Diesel isn't like a true Sour

424
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:03,000
Diesel and um it it just that that's

425
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,399
what this is the AJ sour diesel auto is

426
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,958
what I've been working on with this one

427
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,919
and now I'm using this pilen from this

428
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,919
to cross to the other sour diesels to

429
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,838
work those into Auto format um but I had

430
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,399
the the j plant speaker Sour Diesel

431
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,560
earlier this year and that was fantastic

432
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,318
um I've had some out in Colorado there's

433
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,719
a a little club called Cervantes out

434
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,000
there and the guy there had a sour

435
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,759
diesel that's super old and and that was

436
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,879
real nice too but yeah this one is the

437
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,440
the AJ Sour Diesel

438
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,879
that that I've worked into Auto and

439
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,040
that'll be coming out probably next year

440
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:38,720
I think I'm going to hold off and and

441
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,318
release the the blue Power collab this

442
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,959
year and then do the AJ next year

443
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,198
totally look that's that's exciting and

444
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,439
as a side note do you think AJ looks a

445
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,879
little bit like Edward

446
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,839
Norton you know now that you say that

447
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,958
yeah he does think I've always thought

448
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,360
that I mean AJ kind of has like a a

449
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,119
Timeless young look like he like he's

450
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,078
always in college you know what I mean

451
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,959
so I got to meet him I met him in in uh

452
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,399
the park in New York City this past year

453
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,558
with him and Top Dog I was like damn

454
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,079
this is like a real New York cannabis

455
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,519
history moment I got a picture with both

456
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,359
of them was just like this is this is

457
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,838
awesome so I mentioned to them you know

458
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,759
that I was working with him I bought a

459
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,519
little sack of AJ Sour Diesel straight

460
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,879
from the man himself I still got it in

461
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,400
my my desk here with his little

462
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,959
signature on it I was like yeah this is

463
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,079
this is pretty significant milestone in

464
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,000
in my life here so but yeah he

465
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,200
definitely I I do see the Edward Norton

466
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,079
resemblance now that you say that that's

467
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,919
cool man I I actually was looking at

468
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,038
your Instagram last night and I saw that

469
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,320
photo and I was like that would have

470
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,558
been a fun time in that Park on that day

471
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,200
so yeah there you go and just in the

472
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,720
last question I mean you referenced the

473
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,960
sour but in the last questions you

474
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,519
referenced the zadel express I wanted to

475
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,400
formally ask are you like myself are you

476
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,319
more a fan of the sativas than the

477
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
indicas are you impartial or are you

478
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,519
more of an Inda

479
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:02,839
guy oh no that's the T for me um with my

480
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,720
breeding I I always and it's strange how

481
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:06,279
this works people like they think they

482
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,600
like they like a breeder but they really

483
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:11,720
like their pallet and like of

484
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,399
unintentionally bred to help my ADHD and

485
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,919
depression and all just kind of like

486
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,600
personal issues and in doing so it's

487
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,240
helped a bunch of other people like they

488
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,199
they grow and they find the same relief

489
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,679
from these things that I've found but

490
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,519
yeah 100% sativa is for me that's the

491
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,798
the space dog was like a super sativa I

492
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,918
found actually what I I called the super

493
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,119
sativa feno within the cosmic Queen

494
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,280
which is the space dog Auto and I kind

495
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,839
of isolated that and been growing and

496
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,038
smoking that for myself over the past

497
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,839
couple years and that's a big big fan

498
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,400
favorite as well and I just did some

499
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,918
stuff with that one again here for the

500
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
the upcoming Halloween release so the

501
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,440
last time I I released it was four years

502
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,880
ago for Halloween so it's a nice little

503
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,159
reculation of of that coming back

504
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,720
around yeah totally totally I love that

505
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,039
you know what's funny I had a question

506
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,839
about the Halloween stuff and

507
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:07,240
essentially what I wanted to ask was I I

508
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,558
love how you do all these cool unique

509
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,599
little drops you know I'm sure other

510
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,480
people do Halloween drops but I I I feel

511
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,918
like you have a lot of fun with it so to

512
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,000
speak and I feel like there's a little

513
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,799
bit of a sentiment in the community at

514
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,519
the moment that things are all a bit you

515
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,279
know Doom and Gloom and no one really

516
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,720
seems like they're having fun anymore I

517
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,599
wanted to ask you how do you how do you

518
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,319
keep it light and you know how what's

519
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,519
your advice for people to keep keep you

520
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,519
know cannabis and growing

521
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:39,119
fun I mean I know it's cheesy but you

522
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,080
gotta love it like I would be doing this

523
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,959
whether I was selling the seeds or not

524
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:46,558
like this is this is what I I my mom sat

525
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,360
me down in sixth grade because I was no

526
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,960
good in school and she was like what do

527
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,359
you want to do what do you want to do

528
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,200
with your life I was like I want to live

529
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,918
on the side of a mountain somewhere

530
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,038
tropical and grow weed I was like that's

531
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,840
that's it that's like the dream for me

532
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,359
and I I mean I got partially there I was

533
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,199
on the side of a mountain in Colorado

534
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:08,000
growing weed but um yeah no no real

535
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,558
tropical location quite yet um but yeah

536
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,720
you really don't get in it for the wrong

537
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,558
reasons it's not a a cash grab situation

538
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,200
a lot of people get into it thinking

539
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,000
this is going to be like some big

540
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,200
booming industry I remember everybody

541
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,480
wanted to be a master grower for for a

542
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,960
time when that was like a a the term

543
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,400
going around and everybody thought it

544
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,960
was like big bucks and yeah you just

545
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,880
can't get into it for that reason that's

546
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,400
not what it's about the the plant won't

547
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,919
treat you right if that's how you treat

548
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,759
it and that's really kind of as simple

549
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:41,480
as that as far as keeping

550
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:44,079
things um invigorated so to speak man me

551
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,360
and my buddy Zan who's my Graphics guy

552
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,158
we just have an absolute blast with like

553
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,079
coming up with new Concepts and new

554
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,080
ideas um for this upcoming Halloween one

555
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:56,079
we're doing the collab with Sin City

556
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:57,839
Seeds they in Las Vegas obviously it

557
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,480
finally gave me the opportunity to do

558
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,558
some like Hunter Thompson Feer and

559
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,720
Loathing stuff and coming up with all

560
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,678
the designs for that coming up with like

561
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,400
we got some posters coming

562
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,798
out I've got like seven different sample

563
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,320
posters coming holographic ones um gold

564
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,240
um like variant just a bunch of

565
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:20,599
different cool graphics and I really

566
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:24,038
like to be able to express an idea um an

567
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:26,839
artistic idea to my my buddy who can

568
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,319
then put it into reality and create this

569
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,240
thing from a vision that I have whether

570
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,558
it's just words that I speak to him

571
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,120
whether it's a sketch that I send him

572
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:39,798
it's just it's phenomenal and doing this

573
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:42,678
business I never wanted I owned a a a

574
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,558
business before this and it was in the

575
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,600
fishing industry and it wasn't something

576
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,240
that I enjoyed doing it was something

577
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,519
that I did because it was the job and

578
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,640
when I started growing I was like wow

579
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,960
this is like really where my passion is

580
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,600
at if I can pursue this somehow and like

581
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,360
do enough to make a living where I'm

582
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,798
doing what I love like why wouldn't I

583
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,759
want to do that you know even if it's

584
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,599
not as lucrative as something else it's

585
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,400
like it's just way better this is what I

586
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:14,278
want to be doing you know so the

587
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,880
freedom I say freedom I mean you're on a

588
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:18,000
plant schedule and you know you're kind

589
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,360
of locked into to that and you're

590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,599
constantly doing upkeep and maintaining

591
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,000
and and all that but yeah it's just it's

592
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,719
it's all encompassing this business

593
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,919
where I can Flex my creativity through

594
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,400
the artwork side of things or the plant

595
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,679
side of things um the interaction with

596
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,440
the customers seeing other people grow

597
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,400
stuff that I've created and enjoy it is

598
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,720
just so rewarding that there's I don't

599
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,120
think there's anything else on the

600
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,558
planet like

601
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,479
it at least for me

602
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,558
personally yeah totally totally and I I

603
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,839
think that what you speak resonates with

604
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,440
a lot of people you know you've got to

605
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,439
keep that element of passion alive

606
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,679
otherwise it does just become monotonous

607
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,320
and a way to pay the bills and you know

608
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,759
there's obviously a complex answer to a

609
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,119
simple question there another I don't

610
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,919
want to cut off but another thing with

611
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,798
that is I'm constantly working to create

612
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,640
something new so it never gets stale

613
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,000
there's so many amazing photo periods

614
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,038
out there more and more every year that

615
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,759
I'd love to work with and and turn into

616
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,440
Auto format that you know that that

617
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,960
constantly keeps me motivated too

618
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,919
because it's like damn Gary Payton like

619
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,000
I know it's it's a cookie family strain

620
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,440
and then people will [ __ ] on cookie

621
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,919
stuff but that Gary paint insire I love

622
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,798
that like I can't wait to to work that

623
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,240
in the auto format for people and you

624
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:38,158
know there's always something new I'm

625
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,278
I'm working on a pith Auto with pith

626
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,520
Coast which is like phenomenal that's

627
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:45,000
probably my my favorite smoke recently

628
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:47,599
the the pith S2 number three the

629
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,839
pineapple piff from Top Dog they're just

630
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,678
incredible stuff so there's there's

631
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,480
always something new to be doing and

632
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,400
kind of one of the the downsides of what

633
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,240
I do is people always want stuff that

634
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,840
I've released before

635
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,079
and to me I love all everything I've

636
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,720
created I'm I'm a fan of um but to go

637
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,319
back like takes away from the current

638
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,000
work and the current projects that I

639
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:13,240
have going and I only have so much space

640
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,599
and so many hours in a day that it's

641
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,558
like I have to make difficult decisions

642
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,798
on whether do I dedicate this space now

643
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,399
to reproductions or do I continue

644
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:24,079
working on new projects so that's kind

645
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,399
of like my big my biggest downside of

646
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,119
the whole thing is just there's never

647
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:29,439
enough time or space to do everything

648
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,599
that I want to be doing

649
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,798
yeah of course of course and look I

650
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,798
definitely want to delve into some of

651
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,000
the more technical aspects but while

652
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:39,879
we're on the topic you know you're

653
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,960
talking about cool and popular photo

654
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,799
periods um I want to know you posted up

655
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,798
an interesting photo where was sort of

656
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,720
like a grid of nine different really

657
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,839
popular strains that you had pollinated

658
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,079
and were sort of considering converting

659
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:56,319
to autos of those nine which were some

660
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,079
of the ones that sort of jump out to you

661
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:02,038
as ones you think you might pursue

662
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,720
I love that apples and bananas man that

663
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:06,919
one really caught me off guard because I

664
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,558
had no expectations going into it but

665
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:13,159
that one really was was incredible to me

666
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,798
that and the Honey banana man that is

667
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,799
another one that's amazing I've got the

668
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,079
banana OG Auto will be coming out next

669
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:21,480
year as well it's another one that I've

670
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:24,038
been working on but this honey banana is

671
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,319
is beautiful the hash it produces is

672
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:28,558
amazing it yields real well it's a

673
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,839
vigorous plant it's a a very beautiful

674
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,278
plant to look at so that's another one

675
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,599
that um was in that run let's see the

676
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,599
thin mint I'd really like to do just for

677
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,359
kind of the sake of that being like such

678
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,000
a sought after strain for so long and

679
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,000
the fact that it took me like eight

680
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
years to get get a hold of like the real

681
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,159
cut of it I was like man well I got to

682
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,000
do this due diligence to to actually put

683
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,640
this into Auto format so that's another

684
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,359
one I'm trying to think of what else was

685
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,679
in that I think there was two maybe two

686
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:04,199
grids of nine each but most of

687
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,759
those I I would fly out to um Portland

688
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,840
Oregon to Archive to grab from his

689
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,879
dispensary out there and it would take

690
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,639
me multiple trips and and I did this two

691
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,960
times I did it when I was in Colorado I

692
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,440
went out multiple times flew out brought

693
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,600
the stuff back and then once I got out

694
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,880
to Maine I left those cuts out in

695
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,398
Colorado I was like you know what I'll

696
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,159
just do it again I'll fly back out there

697
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:27,479
grab them again whatever so this time I

698
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,480
took my girlfriend out with me and we

699
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,480
get out there we could buy twice as many

700
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,960
clones per day because she was there we

701
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,558
we stayed out there for the weekend

702
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,000
loaded up with like 24 30 Clon something

703
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,720
like that and then there was a hurricane

704
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,960
in Boston which was the airport we were

705
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,558
flying back into so our flight got

706
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,519
delayed one day two days three days so I

707
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,798
had in our little hotel room I went out

708
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,480
and bought lights had a whole little

709
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,480
little veg Garden in the bathroom of

710
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,759
this hotel room and we went out to

711
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,399
dinner I get a text from the hotel

712
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,200
saying um there's been a smell of smoke

713
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:06,439
on the on the floor you're staying on

714
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,360
and we traced it back to your room you

715
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,600
need to get rid of this or else the

716
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,639
police will be involved something like

717
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,158
that I don't know I've got the the

718
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,320
screenshots in my phone still I posted

719
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,960
it up at one point and I was like I

720
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,798
should probably take this down but

721
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,000
anyway we get back to the

722
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,200
hotel I immediately drive back I don't

723
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,839
respond to the text and I had stayed at

724
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,240
this hotel six seven times before

725
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,240
because I would stay in the same Hotel

726
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,480
every time it's a hotel from like the

727
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,440
1950s it's just been around forever all

728
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
old people there at the front desk they

729
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,000
give you cookies when you check in and

730
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,240
the night before it was a new person I'd

731
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,558
never seen before like when I checked in

732
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,159
and so I was like oh do you have those

733
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:44,720
cookies or whatever kind of like trying

734
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,159

never seen before and he like yeah here

736
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,559

737
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,519
was like I just wanted to let you know

738
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,158
there's been no smoking in the room um

739
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,480
but I understand what's going on and

740
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,159
I'll get it taken care of no problem and

741
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,880

742
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,519

745
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,480

748
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,918

749
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,278

750
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,080

753
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,720

754
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,278
they were like oh let me get you a new

755
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,798
key the old guy who's like on my side

756
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:33,640
against this this young girl that was

757
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,359
working there he was like yeah let me

758
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,720
let me get you a new key I was like I'm

759
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:41,119
so sorry just I've got my medical card

760
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,839
like everything is above board he was

761
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,719
like I understand we just can't have

762
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,720
that here in the hotel it's like no

763
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,200
problem so took some empty suitcases out

764
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,759
immediately to make it look like we just

765
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,240
took everything out then I sat there

766
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,480
these plants archive clones are are the

767
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,120
best possible clones you could get in

768
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,038
the world they're so healthy they're

769
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,038
teens they're I mean you can take three

770
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,558
four five clones off what he sells as

771
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,119
clones so I started breaking stuff down

772
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:07,000
chopping it into little clones putting

773
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,759
them in zipl bags labeling everything I

774
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,599
don't want to mess anything up took me

775
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,278
probably two hours to actually break

776
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,079
everything down and then really take the

777
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,038
actual not the decoy suitcases but the

778
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:19,599
real suitcases out with everything so

779
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:23,158
I've got the Clones I've got uh the the

780
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,038
Snips as well packed in two suitcases

781
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,840
take them out and just never go back

782
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,240
there and that was like the end of that

783
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:31,720
went to Some Mo Hotel eight just like

784
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,038
the lowest tier Hotel you could ever

785
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,360
stay in the people next to me look like

786
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:38,398
homeless kids like in the room next door

787
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,199
that I mean we got a smoking like a a

788
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,199
cigarette smoking room which you don't

789
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,319
find anywhere anymore so I was like all

790
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,159
right this place isn't going to give two

791
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:46,558
shits about what I got going on they've

792
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,440
got way bigger fish to fry they have

793
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:49,798
literal prostitutes in the parking lot

794
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,880
so this is perfect we're not going to

795
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:54,879
get in any trouble here anyway the

796
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,840
flight gets delayed three days so these

797
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,080
clones are just you know they're they're

798
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,240
they're growing they're like

799
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:04,918
they're they're whatever so pack them up

800
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,480
finally get on the flight well okay we

801
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,278
get to the airport and the flight gets

802
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,440
delayed again as we're there after I've

803
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,480
already sent my bags to be put on the

804
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,600
plane so I'm like [ __ ] well we got the

805
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
hotel room for another night anyway let

806
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,398
me pull the bags off the flight go back

807
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,079
to the hotel room we'll leave in the

808
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,278
morning so I asked them to pull my bags

809
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,918
they're like all right go down to the

810
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,038
baggage claim area they'll be down in

811
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,799

891
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,159

these experience are I think you know it

894
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,798

895
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,319
and you you're dedicated to it it the

896
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,200
plant knows that you know what I mean

897
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,359
like it picks up on those vibes so yeah

898
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,639
it's I don't even remember where again

899
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,839
where we started but oh you were talking

900
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:49,119
about the the grids of of the the nine

901
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,558
plants each so yeah most of those cuts

902
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,918
came from from archive there but yeah

903
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:55,759
all of them were amazing if you ever

904
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,240
need clones archive and Portland Oregon

905
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,839
can't find better clones than there

906
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,919
I I can attest uh certainly um I I too

907
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,519
have visited the dispensary in Portland

908
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,039
many moons ago and picked up some plants

909
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:12,398
and tried to make them magically appear

910
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:16,960
in Australia sadly didn't quite work

911
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,598
anyway uh I I I wanted to ask you and

912
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,519
this is a bit of a change of pace

913
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,800
because I love that answer but I really

914
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:27,039
want to get into what was your thoughts

915
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,399
on some of the early Auto work and

916
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,679
specifically low rider what was your

917
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,918
thoughts on low

918
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,358
rider I never tried

919
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:38,559
it I I saw it many times I've never

920
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:40,559
grown it I've never smoked it I

921
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,759
appreciate what the joint doctor did to

922
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:46,159
popularize it I saw it in High Times all

923
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,679
the times and um it intrigued me the

924
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,000
reason I got into growing Autos was I

925
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,398
moved down to South Carolina I used to

926
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,559
go down to South Carina and spend my

927
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,799
Summers down there because that's where

928
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,920
my grandparents lived After High School

929
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,680
I moved down there go to college and

930
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,039
start this business and um I I made some

931
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,598
connections to to get herb and after the

932
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,880
third or fourth meeting I ended up

933
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,760
getting jumped and robbed and this whole

934
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,240
messy situation and I was like well it's

935
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,000
not worth this to to do the plant thing

936
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,679
what's the fastest or it's not worth

937
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,239
like the the violence aspect in order to

938
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,559
get this shitty weed what's the fastest

939
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:26,239
way that I can actually get get a

940
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,039
harvest and auto flowers was that so

941
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,799
that's that's what got me into grow Auto

942
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:32,119
flowers in the first

943
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,720
place wow that's that's actually a

944
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,559
really interesting introduction let's

945
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,279
why don't we do it why don't we go back

946
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,759
to the start tell me about your first

947
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,000
memory first interaction with

948
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,720
cannabis so I told this story on on the

949
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,039
dark wars podcast before about my older

950
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,759
brother

951
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,159
um yeah I'd say the first time I smoked

952
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,160
was with my older brother going to this

953
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:00,159
little drag strip um I remember drinking

954
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:02,318
some Waka which is like this kind of

955
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,598
orange leor and smoking a joint and

956
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:07,400
going to this this Racetrack and just

957
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,440
being terrified just thought my throat

958
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,039
was closing up I like there this is lace

959
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,599
I must be allergic to it I'm gonna die

960
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,440
blah blah blah and then after that I

961
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,039
remembered oh my god when I was in

962
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,960
fourth grade I guess my brother was in

963
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,400
sixth or seventh grade my mom found his

964
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,800
bowl and his bag of flour and called the

965
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,119
cops to our house to arrest him or Scare

966
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,960
arrest him and that was truly my first

967
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,440
well wasn't even truly my first that was

968
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,079
the first of like I know what's going on

969
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,720
but before that um my dad had 18 Acres

970
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,079
down in Maryland and he had this old

971
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,919
country boy that would grow his own

972
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,480
tobacco and mixed in with that tobacco

973
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,318
were cannabis plants and I just didn't

974
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,519
know because I was you know four five

975
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:48,599
six years old at the time so that was

976
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:51,199
like my very first introduction to it

977
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,079
was that um without even knowing but

978
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,679
yeah there's been a few kind of first

979
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,960
introductions whether I was aware of it

980
00:36:54,679 --> 00:37:00,159
or not but yeah I'd say probably fourth

981
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,199
grade was was the first time that I

982
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,759
really was like what what's going on

983
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,399
here and uh do you remember the first

984
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,200
time you got high was it the first time

985
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,440
you smoked or was it a subsequent time

986
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,159
after no it was the first time I was

987
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,440
going to that that racetrack yeah we my

988
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:20,318
brother 78 Cadillac DeVille like a full

989
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,880
sound system and I even remember like

990
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,960
the some of the songs we were listening

991
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,079
to at the time the the very first

992
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,880
ludicrous album and some some Mindless

993
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:32,160
Self Indulgence and it was just a a

994
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,640
weird um a weird mix of music but yeah

995
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,000
that was the very first time was was

996
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:39,039
going to that drag STP sure and how did

997
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,119
your interest in cannabis progress over

998
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,239
the years towards say when you did your

999
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:48,039
first

1000
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:49,399
grow um there's a band called 311 that

1001
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,079
everybody makes fun of is like one of

1002
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,920
the worst bands in the world or whatever

1003
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,318
but their first few albums had so much

1004
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,200
cannabis related um so many cannabis

1005
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:03,039
themes to them throughout that it just

1006
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:05,318
intrigued me that this plant could like

1007
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,358
motivate and bring people together the

1008
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:10,079
way it did and then seeing their home

1009
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:13,078
videos of like concerts and stuff it was

1010
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,440
like more of a modern kind of dead scene

1011
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,079
parking lot scene where you know

1012
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,280
everybody was like smoking and trading

1013
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,480
and doing that sort of thing and again

1014
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,839
nowadays they're almost looked at as the

1015
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,599
butt of a joke but back then they were

1016
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,039
like something really they're still

1017
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,720
really special to me I mean their their

1018
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,199
modern stuff does sound like a pair of

1019
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:32,919
of themselves but back then it was like

1020
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,919
this this special thing of like just

1021
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,639
this Niche community of people that we

1022
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,480
into this music and this smoking and

1023
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,199
this kind of mindset of like you know

1024
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,240
[ __ ] what people are G to tell me to do

1025
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,318
um it's not all about money it's about

1026
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,959
community and like bringing people

1027
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:52,519
together and sharing and joy and that

1028
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,880
kind of influenced me so heavy as a kid

1029
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:56,599
and still know to this day that that

1030
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,200
that kind of continued throughout my

1031
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,599
entire life and that was like when like

1032
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,838
I was saying in sixth grade when my mom

1033
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,559
sat me down that was so heavily

1034
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,559
influenced by them I hadn't even smoked

1035
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:08,159
at that point it was just like man to

1036
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,639
see the effect that this has on people

1037
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,239
the positive effect that it has on

1038
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:14,078
people really left an impression on me

1039
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,358
and I wanted to explore that as soon as

1040
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,240
I could and so that was kind

1041
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:21,078
of kind of like the through line of of

1042
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:23,799
what's motivated me through all of this

1043
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,599
was that early on introduction through

1044
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,920
through

1045
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,880
music and so so I mean at first were you

1046
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,318
growing photo

1047
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,440
period yeah yep and my first grow was in

1048
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,119
high school um just some Bag seed stuff

1049
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,159
I

1050
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,960
remember finding out that you had to

1051
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:45,679
flip the lights to get them to actually

1052
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,240
flower and it's so funny so these plants

1053
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,399
we were growing at my buddy's house in

1054
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,519
his garage in like the attic of his

1055
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,358
garage and his mom found them and was

1056
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,800
like you got to get these out of here so

1057
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,078
we took them over to my dad's farm and

1058
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,160
then he found them and was like you

1059
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,599
gotta get these out of here so I threw

1060
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:02,239
them in the back of a truck and like

1061
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,680
started to leave and he saw me leaving

1062
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,598
with these plants in the back of a truck

1063
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,199
was like no you can't do that bring them

1064
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,838
back and so I kept them there on the

1065
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:11,279
farm and grew them out there but I

1066
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,480
remember asking my buddy like how did

1067
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,480
you get these so big and like so healthy

1068
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,199
and he was like Miracle Grow spikes and

1069
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,719
diesel fuel and for two weeks I was just

1070
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:25,239
like what the do I really put diesel

1071
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,598
fuel on these like I shoved a 100

1072
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:30,439
Miracle gross bikes in these pots and

1073
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,680
then years later I was like bro like did

1074
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,559
you he was like I was just [ __ ] with

1075
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:38,399
you that was a joke I was like oh my

1076
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:40,199
God all right fair enough but yeah um

1077
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,519
that was that was my first grow I

1078
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:43,239
remember what I did find out about you

1079
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,639
know putting on putting them on

1080
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:49,039
1212 um my buddy's dad came over to

1081
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,559
visit and was like so stoked to check

1082
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,079
him out and they were in a bathroom and

1083
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,440
he left the overhead bathroom light on

1084
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,280
that wasn't on a timer as they were in

1085
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,440
flower and I was out of town doing my

1086
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,119
business stuff and I came back and the

1087
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,039
light was on and I like I I freaked out

1088
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,720
at him and it like it soured our

1089
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:09,639
relationship like the dude was like you

1090
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:11,879
think I would yell at your dad like that

1091
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:13,279
like I was like I'm I'm sorry I was just

1092
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,440
this is something that I've invested so

1093
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,599
much time and so much energy into and

1094
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,519
like I don't know I just felt like this

1095
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,838
whole thing just got [ __ ] up for for

1096
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,079
nothing like I shouldn't have told

1097
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,599
anybody what I was doing to begin with

1098
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,359
and then for this to happen was just

1099
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,720
like H but anyway we worked all out and

1100
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:31,838
everything was good and still a friend

1101
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,399
of this day so yeah know no worries

1102
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:34,759
there but at the time it was like the

1103
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,599
biggest thing that had ever happened to

1104
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,920
me because I was so stoked to finally be

1105
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:42,240
in flower like doing it anyway they

1106
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,440
ended up being super long flowering

1107
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,799
Mexican sativa things that I chopped

1108
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,880
early and then took down to to South

1109
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,839
Carolina with me that was like my little

1110
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,920
little little bumper crap sort of thing

1111
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:57,279
that uh yeah I took down and that got me

1112
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,680
over in South Carolina until I met

1113
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,040
people at the college down there to

1114
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:02,879
actually get get flower from and then

1115
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,759
all that other stuff transpired and got

1116
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,880
me right back into to Growing but with

1117
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,640
Autos so this time I was serious about

1118
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,480
it so yeah tell me about that tell me

1119
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:14,318
about your first time growing an auto do

1120
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,679
you remember what it was what did was

1121
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,920
that the Eureka moment or was it a few

1122
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,358
more grows after

1123
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,838
that so I think the first would have

1124
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:27,960
been probably some Dutch Passion stuff

1125
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,719
and I did it

1126
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,159
I just found someone online that was

1127
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,358
doing it well and that was yielding well

1128
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:38,639
and that was having amazing results

1129
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:41,078
excuse me and I just followed his method

1130
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:44,440
exactly at the time he was posting

1131
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:47,599
exactly what was going into his name was

1132
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,760
um Seymour buds on autoflower.net I

1133
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,640
bought the exact LED lights that he used

1134
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,440
that were called hydr grow from this

1135
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:56,639
company in the UK Cammy was the the

1136
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,358
person's name that ran that company I

1137
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,400
bought those there were the penetrator

1138
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:03,679
LEDs and they were just massive massive

1139
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,440
panels and then I started getting like

1140
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,039
um Gotham Hydro LEDs was another company

1141
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,679
that was big at the time so I would buy

1142
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,199
those and I just followed exactly the

1143
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:15,358
same seeds that he had the same

1144
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,919
nutrients that he had and ended up

1145
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:21,440
starting doing deep water culture and so

1146
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,599
my first harvest was like 10 ounces off

1147
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,318
of a single Auto and I was blown away

1148
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,760
that I was able to do this and it was

1149
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:31,800
like just yeah that was the Eureka

1150
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,920
moment but the thing was and this is not

1151
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,880
to throw this is probably more on my

1152
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,000
skills at the time rather than genetics

1153
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,280
themselves but it was like I've got 10

1154
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,559
ounces of [ __ ] that I don't really want

1155
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,599
to smoke like it's it's not good it's

1156
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:45,960
lacking in almost every department and I

1157
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,760
was like well this was my first run so

1158
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,559
whatever and then I moved on to other

1159
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,880
other breeders and other genetics and

1160
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,280
each time it got a little bit better and

1161
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,119
a little bit better and I was like you

1162
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,119
know what people are doing this the

1163
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,440
right way there's um a formula to create

1164
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,000
creating and and making these things

1165
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,760
better let me follow that formula myself

1166
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,679
and try my hand at this that was kind of

1167
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,520
what got me started in the whole

1168
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:10,759
breeding aspect of

1169
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:12,639
things before we jump into a bit more of

1170
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,319
like your story I just want to quickly

1171
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,358
ask you more of shall we say a

1172
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,679
philosophical question which

1173
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:20,639
is I have been wondering this and other

1174
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:23,039
people have asked as well you know do

1175
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:27,199
you think that to an extent breeding

1176
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:30,679
Autos requires more skill or do you

1177
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,919
think that simply it requires skill but

1178
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:36,118
also there's sort of inherently like a

1179
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,079
bit of luck involved as well um at least

1180
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,400
in one step that you know you might go

1181
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,760
really good in your first generation

1182
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,599
then that sets you up for Success

1183
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,000
thereafter but I guess I'm wondering do

1184
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,359
you think it's just more difficult or

1185
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,039
that it's difficult but there's also a

1186
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,318
luck

1187
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,599
component both for sure it's absolutely

1188
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:54,519
more difficult every photo breeder that

1189
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,599
I work with is like damn this is what

1190
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:58,480
you do like by the time we get to

1191
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,200
working they screen into an auto they're

1192
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,599
like this is way harder even um shout

1193
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:07,838
out to C here now James Bean back in

1194
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:10,000
2015 2016 was like these guys are doing

1195
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:12,759
real work this is so much harder than

1196
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,239
photo period breeding like every aspect

1197
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,440
of it is more difficult um there's no

1198
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:20,679
keeping clones there's it's it's easy to

1199
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:25,480
make the wrong selection it's easy to

1200
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:27,639
breed back the ruderalis stuff to to um

1201
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,480
impact the the gene pool negative

1202
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:32,960
so there's a lot of like uh pitfalls

1203
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,800
that you can find yourself kind of

1204
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,599
jumping over um but there's also a lot

1205
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,000
of luck involved absolutely so it's not

1206
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,720
like you know any one person is just

1207
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,159
going to be the best auto period breeder

1208
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:50,799
100% of the time on default it's it's a

1209
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,879
game of of skill as much as it is you

1210
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,640
know I locked out and found the right

1211
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,680
things this this time I mean maybe not

1212
00:45:55,639 --> 00:46:00,558
as much there's a lot of you know

1213
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,318
running the proper numbers um making

1214
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,440
sure you have backup plans for every

1215
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,318
step of the way but yeah there's there's

1216
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,240
a lot of hard work and a lot of skill

1217
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:12,719
involved but yeah a lot of luck

1218
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,318
too certainly certainly and I'm sure

1219
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,879
we'll talk about that when we talk about

1220
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,480
some of the technical aspects of

1221
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,240
breeding but I wanted to quickly ask you

1222
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,000
I've only spoken to a very small number

1223
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,239
of people who have bred Autos but

1224
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,639
they've all sort of shared many common

1225
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:30,679
sentiments one of them being that it's

1226
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:33,879
incredibly easy to sort of dud an autol

1227
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:36,318
line um and I guess I'm wondering how

1228
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,720
often is it that you find you sort of

1229
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,519
say to yourself I think I need to go

1230
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:41,318
back a couple Generations or you know I

1231
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,239
need to restart this we've we've gone

1232
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:44,880
wrong at some point does it happen

1233
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,959
commonly or is it a bit less common

1234
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,838
these

1235
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,039
days I'm I'm knocking on wood right now

1236
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:54,199
because fortunately it hasn't happened

1237
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:58,159
too many times there's

1238
00:46:54,199 --> 00:47:00,639
maybe two two projects i' say that I

1239
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:03,318
could go back and and revisit and redo

1240
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:05,879
better than I've done before um other

1241
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,558
than that I'm really really genuinely

1242
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,480
happy with everything that I've put out

1243
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:13,400
like I I think it's it's all been really

1244
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:17,159
really good it's all been improvements

1245
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,559
upon what they used to be um but yeah it

1246
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,759
is easy to do that I do think um I don't

1247
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,960
know epigenetics is the right term but

1248
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,720
you can see stunting from one generation

1249
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,800
carried over into the stock of the Next

1250
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,679
Generation way more so than you would

1251
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,640
with a photo period And I have noticed

1252
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:36,598
that same for you know you grow a huge

1253
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:40,000
Auto

1254
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:42,440
um both parents being being huge grown

1255
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,039
perfectly the the seeds resulting from

1256
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,318
those come out impeccable so there's

1257
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:49,279
definitely something to that and locking

1258
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:53,000
in both negative and positive traits

1259
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,160
within the line um but yeah we can get

1260
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,880
into that I guess a little bit more when

1261
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,598
we talk about breeding but really you

1262
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:02,440
just you got to be there for him early

1263
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:05,200
on there's a old Chinese saying proverb

1264
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,599
thing that's like the best best nutrient

1265
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,000
is the The Gardener Shadow so it's one

1266
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,119
of those things where you really have to

1267
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,719
be there and and care for him especially

1268
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,240
the first four weeks or

1269
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,759
so definitely definitely and there's two

1270
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,078
follow-ups I want to ask you but the

1271
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,119
first one is what would be your advice

1272
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,960
for someone like myself who sees some of

1273
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:26,358
the photos you post and you're like oh

1274
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,960
my God that is the biggest Auto flow

1275
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:30,119
like when you see a whole plant in a pot

1276
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,559
at Harvest you're like that thing is

1277
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,800
huge you know as you said like really

1278
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:38,359
huge yield off it what are some of the

1279
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,640
tips you would give people to help get

1280
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:42,838
an auto to that size cuz I think for a

1281
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,759
lot of us it's very rare to see

1282
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:48,159
something go that

1283
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,880
well um you know Hydro you can't go

1284
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:53,318
wrong with with Autos the deep water

1285
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,200
culture really LS itself to gigantic

1286
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:57,920
autos because there's no resistance to

1287
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,078
the roots same for Coke they get huge in

1288
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,119
that really the fluffier the soil um the

1289
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,318
less resistance against the roots the

1290
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:10,400
bigger and the longer the vegge for um

1291
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:13,119
if they run into twoo compact of soil if

1292
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,358
it's too dense it sends a message to the

1293
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,599
plant that hey you know we're out of

1294
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:18,838
space here we need to do something it's

1295
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:20,400
the end of our life we want to reproduce

1296
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,318
we want to carry on into the Next

1297
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,559
Generation let's flip into flower now

1298
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,798
while we have you know ample space to do

1299
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,798
so and so that's kind of of one of the

1300
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:34,358
things is just giving them enough root

1301
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:37,480
space early on and having crapper soil

1302
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:39,039
and you know fluffiness to the soil so

1303
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,039
that the roots can really spread out

1304
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:43,119
easily and there isn't much resistance

1305
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,558
same I mean it's really you can't

1306
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,440
overwater them you can't underwater them

1307
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:49,680
if you do either of those they'll stunt

1308
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,798
out it's really learning kind of the

1309
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,358
plant and as you know I cross back to

1310
00:49:52,798 --> 00:49:55,960
photos breed them out to Autos again

1311
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:58,400
they get more resilient a lot of the

1312
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,720
times each generation So and I've also

1313
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,280
learned over the past 10 years of you

1314
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,439
know you can transplant Autos they're

1315
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,200
not going to yield as much but you can

1316
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,039
do it properly where it doesn't

1317
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:11,519
completely stunt them out and affect the

1318
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:14,199
yield and nowadays with things like Auto

1319
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,000
pots and the trade to grow system where

1320
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:18,719
you know they're taking up the amount of

1321
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,559
water they want to be taking up um I

1322
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,239
mean you can start a bunch in small pots

1323
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,720
in that sort of system and then

1324
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,959
transplant them into bigger uh bigger

1325
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:30,318
systems and they just take off they

1326
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,039
don't miss a beat so it's really um kind

1327
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,358
of developing the the understanding of

1328
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,558
when to transplant them when it's too

1329
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:41,119
late when to cut your losses and yeah

1330
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,640
just just there's there's no replacement

1331
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,280
for actually doing it it's just kind of

1332
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,798
a Hands-On thing I could explain it a

1333
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,880
hundred times and until you actually do

1334
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:52,798
it and learn it in or Hands-On with it

1335
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,400
it it just it's hard to to to wrap your

1336
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:56,280
head around it's hard to grasp it's kind

1337
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,599
of something that you have to do to

1338
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,319
learn it

1339
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,798
that yeah certainly and look I want to

1340
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,960
ask a bit of a newbie question as

1341
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:08,199
someone who has only grown about four or

1342
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,039
five Autos before when people transplant

1343
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:13,358
the Autos I often hear them having this

1344
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:16,039
very particular focus on being like in a

1345
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:18,078
tactile sense very gentle with the root

1346
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,838
ball and of course you know no no one

1347
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:24,519
advocates for manhandling a root ball so

1348
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:26,639
to speak but I wonder do you think that

1349
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:28,798
that very like literally as gently as

1350
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,679
you can transplanting it and just just

1351
00:51:28,798 --> 00:51:32,119
just so lightly tapping it down you know

1352
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:33,519
what I mean like do you think that sort

1353
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:34,720
of thing does make a difference or do

1354
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,358
you think it's more about like the

1355
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:39,480
General Health of the plant when we talk

1356
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:42,440
about stressing the plant

1357
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,599
out I'm I'm a firm believer that the the

1358
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,480
more gentle the better yeah to this day

1359
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:50,480
that's something that I still focus on

1360
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:53,039
and um I I rarely ever have help with

1361
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,240
with anything in the garden I do pretty

1362
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:59,358
much everything myself

1363
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:03,159
from OB the Clones to harvesting the F4

1364
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:05,759
Auto seeds at the end it's it's a me and

1365
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:07,078
if I ever do have somebody come in

1366
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,520
that's the most important thing that I

1367
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:11,240
stress is if there's a transplant I

1368
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,358
usually will explain to them exactly how

1369
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:16,399
I want it done and then do it myself

1370
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,239
it's like I just I don't have uh I'm not

1371
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,960
good a delegating responsibility and

1372
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,439
with this it's like that's the most

1373
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,318
critical stage of of the whole thing is

1374
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,480
like making sure to to minimize the

1375
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,519
stunting as much as possible

1376
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,358
um yeah I absolutely believe in that

1377
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:34,199
that's that's that's

1378
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,920
key yeah good answer there you go I

1379
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:38,279
wanted to ask on that topic you know

1380
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,760
you've mentioned soil I would love to

1381
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,640
hear a bit more about your grow Style

1382
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,359
just generally speaking because you know

1383
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,440
I I do hear people at times say you

1384
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:48,558
should grow with lighter nutrients for

1385
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,119
Autos so love to hear your thoughts on

1386
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,440
that but also if you could tell us a bit

1387
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,480
about the the awesome collab you have

1388
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:59,720
with our buddies at Builder

1389
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,760
oil yeah so for the longest time um

1390
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:05,519
pretty much as as soon as I stopped

1391
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,720
doing hydro which um I stopped doing

1392
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,480
because as I started to grow more and

1393
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:13,159
more plants I upgraded my pump to a big

1394
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,760
kind of like a pond siiz pump the a big

1395
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:17,078
big boy I didn't upgrade the manifold or

1396
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,760
the tubing so I was still running

1397
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,839
through all super small tubing which

1398
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,040
created back pressure on the pump and

1399
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:25,558
then heated up the reservoirs and caused

1400
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:28,358
me to get root rat and so I had to learn

1401
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,559
about um what was it called at the time

1402
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:31,719
Heisenberg tea was what people were

1403
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,200
calling it at the time which was

1404
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:36,598
basically a um a worm casting tea with a

1405
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,118
few other things in it so I used that to

1406
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:40,160
kind of get through and fight the root

1407
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:41,798
Rod off and it went from being a what

1408
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,239
was supposed to be a completely sterile

1409
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:47,838
environment into well now I'm doing some

1410
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:50,159
sort of hybrid hydroorganic uh synthetic

1411
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:52,440
thing here after that I switched to

1412
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:56,519
Super soil and I started mixing up the

1413
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,838
Vicky subcool style super soil and what

1414
00:53:56,519 --> 00:53:59,639
I would do for that was I would take a

1415
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,960
five gallon bucket and I would do the

1416
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:04,159
bottom half with a super soil mixed into

1417
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,000
Roots original and then the top half

1418
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,960
would be just unamended Roots original

1419
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,599
well out of the bag it has amendments in

1420
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,119
it but just Roots original soil on top

1421
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,280
of that so that the auto would had time

1422
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,358
to establish in that before hitting the

1423
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,559
hotter stuff because you planted them

1424
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,119
into hot soil if you put them directly

1425
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,400
into the Super soil they would just stun

1426
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,119
out because it was just too much for

1427
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,838
them so this would give the roots time

1428
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,960
to establish before hitting that hotter

1429
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,920
stuff and they absolutely love that man

1430
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,960
I stuck with that for basically until

1431
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:37,639
two years ago that was my my methodology

1432
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,838
um now I use once I switched so I always

1433
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:42,480
did like I said five gallon buckets and

1434
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:44,279
then seeing all these Auto poot grows

1435
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,599
and people just getting these absolute

1436
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,440
monsters and autopots really had me

1437
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:51,798
scratching my head because I was always

1438
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,639
of the mindset that [ __ ] automation you

1439
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:56,440
know like that takes the passion out of

1440
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:58,838
it that takes your skill out of it like

1441
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,358
that's just it's it's for for mids it's

1442
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:03,400
for corporate cannabis whatever and then

1443
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:05,838
I actually tried it with the super soil

1444
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,039
and could not believe the results but

1445
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:10,239
because of how big and how quickly they

1446
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,798
grew in this autop poot setting they

1447
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,118
would eat through all the Amendments

1448
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:15,519
that were usually enough to carry them

1449
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,960
through to flower so then it became all

1450
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:19,199
right well I got to figure out top

1451
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,960
dressing sometimes I'll have to hit them

1452
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,759
like in an emergency situation with some

1453
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,559
sort of organic liquid nutrients just to

1454
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,640
get them something faster um but now

1455
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:30,039
I've switched to build a soil

1456
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:33,078
3.0 which everybody told me was going to

1457
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:35,359
be too hot for Autos too strong but man

1458
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,839
they absolutely love it so now I I

1459
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:40,239
transplant into 3.0 I still start them

1460
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:44,480
out in Roots original transplant into

1461
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:47,159
the 3.0 into the 6.6 gallon Auto pots

1462
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,798
and you can't beat it man they are just

1463
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:51,279
they are

1464
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,719
incredible that's awesome and and do you

1465
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,440
top dress what are some of the

1466
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:58,239
Amendments you like to use

1467
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,639
as of now I haven't been top dressing

1468
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:04,159
I've just been doing the 3.0 um but I do

1469
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:07,558
have builda flower here so if I ever do

1470
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:10,440
need to do that I I will um I did have

1471
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:13,680
to top dress I was doing a warehouse in

1472
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:16,519
Colorado about two years ago and that

1473
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,318
was like my first major run in autopts

1474
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:20,440
and again they just caught me off guard

1475
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,960
with how huge they got and how quickly

1476
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:27,559
they went through the soil so I did have

1477
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:28,960
to top dress there um but yeah that uh

1478
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:31,480
let's see as far as how dressing yeah

1479
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,358
builda a builda flower is really the

1480
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,199
main one I like to throw worm castings

1481
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,558
on top I've started putting black trash

1482
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:40,519
bags putting them out and putting them

1483
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,160
on the top of the soil so they have

1484
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:44,159
beeder Roots at the very top when you

1485
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:47,000
lift it up they even grow mushrooms and

1486
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,920
stuff under there but anyway so now in

1487
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,239
case of emergency if I ever do need to

1488
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,480
top dress the roots are right there

1489
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:55,118
ready to take it in and that was

1490
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,639
something that I saw um through Jeremy

1491
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,960
at build soil through his video vide I

1492
00:56:56,639 --> 00:56:59,838
think with our earth box he pulled the

1493
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,159
cover back and showed all the the feeder

1494
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:02,960
Roots right there and I was like man I

1495
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:05,038
need to implement this somehow with what

1496
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,519
I got going on so that was kind of the

1497
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,880
impetus for that um but yeah really it's

1498
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:12,960
just Bal soil amendments at this point

1499
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:15,680
and as far as the cab stuff goes

1500
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,559
um he's amazing I'd love to do like a

1501
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:20,759
proper Autoflower slow cab with him but

1502
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,319
to be honest the 3.0 is kicking ass so

1503
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,960
there's really not much if it was a

1504
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:26,759
little bit fluffier that would be good

1505
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,358
but even as is I mean it it works it

1506
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,839
works amazing the the flower from it

1507
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,558
phenomenal so there's really just a few

1508
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,639
small tweaks that could be made to

1509
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:38,079
improve that like when we first started

1510
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:42,159
talking he he thought the 3.0 would be

1511
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,440
way too hot so he made a very airy very

1512
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,920
loose soil with almost no amendments in

1513
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,960
it and that one he would have to top

1514
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,240
dress and work with and as soon as I

1515
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,440
tried the 3.0 I saw other people trying

1516
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:54,679
it and I was like is that too hot and

1517
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,838
they were like no man it works great so

1518
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:59,598
I tried it myself and

1519
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:01,078
Game Changer so there's nothing really I

1520
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,720
mean I'd love to collab I'd love to do

1521
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:06,200
an auto soil like we had talked about

1522
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,558
but it's it's almost not necessary if if

1523
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:09,480
you kind of know what you're doing with

1524
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:11,640
with the 3.0 and kind of transplanting

1525
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,199
at the right time um if I wasn't

1526
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:14,920
transplanting into it I would do the

1527
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,960
same kind of layered situation that I

1528
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,680
had done before with the super soil

1529
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,679
where I'd put the 3.0 in the bottom of

1530
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:23,639
the pots and then an unamended soil

1531
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:25,519
light mix or something in the top but my

1532
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:29,358
My Method now I'm constantly

1533
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:30,639
transplanting in so that that works no

1534
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,960
that's that's really cool to hear that

1535
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,798
the 3.0 works for you and I I was just

1536
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,199
sort of thinking you know like it's it's

1537
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:39,880
been so cool and interesting to see how

1538
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,719
many people have been watching the build

1539
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,318
of soil YouTube series like it's so

1540
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:46,159
massively popular and uh you know to see

1541
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:48,400
your genetic sort of shining in there

1542
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,239
that must be really cool while we're on

1543
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,760
the topic uh well sorry while we're on

1544
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,639
the philosophical topics I should say I

1545
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:59,200
wanted to ask you this what are your

1546
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:01,598
thoughts on this sort of perception that

1547
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:04,118
auto flowers are for beginners they're a

1548
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:07,559
stepping stone to photo

1549
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:09,119
periods I think it's just I get it

1550
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:10,798
because of Otto and the name the

1551
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,559
perception of them and that people think

1552
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,920
you know they're not as good but the

1553
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,839
fact of the matter is if you can grow an

1554
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,599
auto flower you can grow a photo period

1555
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:20,920
if you can grow a photo period it's not

1556
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:23,000
necessarily the same a lot of photo

1557
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,599
period people get their egos put in

1558
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,039
check real quick when they try to do on

1559
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:28,519
Autoflower and St them out stunt them

1560
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,880
out stunt them out and just write them

1561
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:32,960
off as you know these suck they're

1562
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,680
exactly what I had in my mind of what an

1563
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,440
Autoflower would be a little popsicle

1564
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,960
blood when in reality you've got to

1565
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:42,480
change what you're doing in order to

1566
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:46,400
maximize an autoflow potential

1567
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,358
so this is no slight to photo periods at

1568
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,480
all I love photos I work with them every

1569
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:55,558
single day but the fact of the matter is

1570
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,000
in general autof flowers are way more

1571
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:59,319
difficult and if you learn to grow on

1572
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,760
Autoflower well you'll have zero issues

1573
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:03,798
growing a photo period in fact photo

1574
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,520
periods I've seen it time and again

1575
01:00:03,798 --> 01:00:08,358
where they actually make Autoflower

1576
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:10,318
Growers lazy because you can veg them

1577
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:12,159
for so long and you can play catchup

1578
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,639
with them where if you look at an auto

1579
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:18,279
flow let's say a longer running one has

1580
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:21,000
a 100 days life cycle each day is 1% of

1581
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,440
its life if you mess up early on you're

1582
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
not getting that those days back and you

1583
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,480
[ __ ] up kind of your foundation for

1584
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,639
the rest of its life there's no no

1585
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,838
rewinding the clock there's no revegging

1586
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,639
there's nothing you can do at that point

1587
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,838
so for a lot of photo period Growers

1588
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:38,078
that that do try Autos it's I tell them

1589
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:39,759
you know you're G to stunt these out

1590
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,119
just go in expecting that you know

1591
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,680
you're GNA stunt your first few out but

1592
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:47,280
you know give it give it a few tries and

1593
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:50,199
once you get over that learning curve

1594
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,519
the reward is is phenomenal like the

1595
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:55,279
explosion of growth the speed the

1596
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,880
resilience of the plants once you get to

1597
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,319
a certain point in their life cycle um

1598
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,480
it's just it's awesome to see you go in

1599
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:06,159
every day and you see the growth like

1600
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,880
even you go you visit your plants a few

1601
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,239
times a day you can see different growth

1602
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,000
throughout the day like they're that

1603
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:14,879
quick at certain stages and back to your

1604
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,719
um top L and thyroid question earlier

1605
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,318
with Autos part of me wonders if the

1606
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:22,439
speed of their growth kind of is faster

1607
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:25,079
than the vroid could catch up with like

1608
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,920
I know like the vroid hangs out kind of

1609
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:29,000
a lot of times in the lower parts photo

1610
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,680
period so you can clone a healthy part

1611
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,599
at top or even you can test different

1612
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:35,159
parts of the plant and it'll be present

1613
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:36,640
in some parts and not the others so I do

1614
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:39,038
wonder if there's something to that of

1615
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:41,078
like just simply the sheer speed at

1616
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,760
which an auto grows does not allow for

1617
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:46,720
that to actually um kind of manifest

1618
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,680
itself but again I've not seen them in

1619
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:51,959
Autos that I am aware of that I could

1620
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:55,239
say yes exactly this is you know the

1621
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,519
viroid here in this plant but yeah I've

1622
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:59,000
been again

1623
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:00,559
touch wood here I'm super fortunate that

1624
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,639
that I haven't dealt with that at all

1625
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,440
and I hope to to never deal with

1626
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:07,199
it yeah it's an interesting question I

1627
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,000
can't say either way but you're right

1628
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:13,318
you know in in normal plant the Marist

1629
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,719
stem doesn't attach to the the xylm and

1630
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:17,239
FL for a certain period of time so you

1631
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:19,278
might be right and because as you said

1632
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:21,358
you know photo Autos can really be

1633
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:23,119
taking off at a certain point that's a

1634
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:24,880
that's an interesting hypothesis I

1635
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,400
wanted to ask you I mean given we've

1636
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,200
spoken about the

1637
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,358
Autos are now at the point where they

1638
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:34,399
don't need to be considered the the

1639
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:36,558
stepping stone to something better and

1640
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,000
you know I guess the implication that

1641
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,119
has been going on throughout this chat

1642
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,079
is that you know when when done right

1643
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:44,079
it's it's high quality it's it's you

1644
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,559
can't really tell the difference uh I

1645
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,960
would love to ask with that in mind

1646
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:50,640
where do you think the future of Autos

1647
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,559
is heading do you think that um we're

1648
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,679
going to get to a point what I've heard

1649
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,960
other guests say in the past is that

1650
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:59,598
they'll become very Comm Outdoors for

1651
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,599
commercial

1652
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:06,759
production absolutely I think even

1653
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:09,199
indoors for production um years ago when

1654
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:13,200
I first moved to Colorado there's a

1655
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:14,838
photo period farmer there 60 lights just

1656
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:18,399
crushing it with with photos and he

1657
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:21,318
wanted to try autos and so I set him up

1658
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,880
with with seeds to do the whole run and

1659
01:03:21,318 --> 01:03:26,639
he was hooked he he completely turned

1660
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:30,559
his whole veg into you know flower at

1661
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:33,278
that point and just had more and quicker

1662
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,240
turnarounds than you'd ever had before

1663
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:37,920
and if you do it right if you if you

1664
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:39,719
figure out kind of the recipe to success

1665
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,119
for you and it's different for everybody

1666
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:44,038
there's a hundred ways to skin a cat but

1667
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:47,160
he followed I mean it was basically like

1668
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:49,000
my grow it's a super soil and it was

1669
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:52,519
like everything was mine it was my

1670
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,239
genetics the super soil and yeah he just

1671
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:56,440
never looked back turned his whole grow

1672
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,959
into Auto he never had complaints from

1673
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,159
people that you know the the quality

1674
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,400
decreased or anything like that it was

1675
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:05,838
more profitable for him it was more

1676
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,639
efficient and you know he did pay a

1677
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,358
little bit more in power Bills running

1678
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:12,558
18 hours of late as opposed to 12 hours

1679
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:16,719
but other than that it made up for it in

1680
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:19,319
in the end so yeah I think it is

1681
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:22,439
definitely definitely a

1682
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:23,838
um kind of the future of of cannabis and

1683
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,760
it's it's weird for me to say that up

1684
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,078
heard other people say it but now

1685
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,839
sitting here thinking about it it's like

1686
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:31,400
there is a lot of potential photo peries

1687
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,119
will never go away nor should they nor

1688
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,599
would I ever advocate for that again I

1689
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,358
love photo periods I don't want anybody

1690
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:40,798
to think I'm like some Autoflower purist

1691
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:42,920
because I love it all um but Autos are

1692
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,838
here to stay and that's that's kind of

1693
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:48,039
the the long and short of it I've seen

1694
01:04:44,838 --> 01:04:50,159
grows out in Oregon Outdoors Auto

1695
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:53,680
flowers that were just monsters just

1696
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:57,038
beautiful beautiful fields of flowers

1697
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:58,719
and yeah it's it's it's a special plant

1698
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,000
and when you when you learn it when you

1699
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:03,399
figure out how to maximize it there's

1700
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,639
it's it's hard to go back to photo

1701
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,559
periods sure sure I I love that story

1702
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,440
and you've referenced a few times you

1703
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,200
know if people want to give this a go

1704
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,318
you you probably will stunt them a few

1705
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:16,919
times but you'll get there just for

1706
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,119
anyone who might be curious and thinking

1707
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,278
about giving it a go what are some of

1708
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,720
those mistakes people often make that

1709
01:05:21,278 --> 01:05:26,239
may lead to it not going so right the

1710
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,519
first few times

1711
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:30,199
pretty much just what I've mentioned

1712
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:33,278
before just having two compact of of

1713
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:36,439
soil uh overwatering or

1714
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:39,039
underwatering um you really gota be

1715
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,039
there kind of on a daily basis lifting

1716
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,520
up the pots and checking to make sure

1717
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,240
you know how are these guys well

1718
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:46,239
nowadays you can you know put a moisture

1719
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,798
meter in there or you can use Auto pots

1720
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,159
or whatever and it's kind of just

1721
01:05:47,798 --> 01:05:51,278
completely changed the whole game for

1722
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:54,519
auto flowers with kind of the evolution

1723
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:56,199
of grow technology um it's much easier

1724
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:57,559
these days to get into it not stun it

1725
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:59,639
there's also way more resources

1726
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:01,200
available and way more people that have

1727
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:03,719
[ __ ] up and you can see where they've

1728
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,038
messed up in the past that now moving

1729
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:08,078
forward you can avoid their mistakes but

1730
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:10,599
really it's just I would say the medium

1731
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:14,278
is the number one thing of just not

1732
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:18,559
having too dense of of soil or or medium

1733
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:22,199
in general um and I do think as each

1734
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:24,760
generation moves you know from an a new

1735
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:26,719
photo back to auto back to photo back to

1736
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,799
Auto they do gain a little bit more

1737
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:32,239
resilience and and tend to really just

1738
01:06:29,798 --> 01:06:34,318
be a little bit harder overall so

1739
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,919
nowadays Autos aren't the same as they

1740
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:39,038
were 10 15 years ago even five years ago

1741
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,278
it's just it's it's a constant Evolution

1742
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,440
and I think it's only getting better

1743
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:45,679
with with the rate selections again as I

1744
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,880
I mentioned before it's it's not not

1745
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:50,440
terribly hard at all to to mess up and

1746
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,160
and you know go back to some rter Alice

1747
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:57,318
looking stuff but with uh with good

1748
01:06:53,159 --> 01:07:00,558
selections and and good good grow set

1749
01:06:57,318 --> 01:07:03,838
good um kind of skill set and knowledge

1750
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,640
beforehand yeah it's way easier to to be

1751
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:08,000
successful with them now than ever

1752
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:10,000
before yeah definitely definitely you

1753
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,199
can tell we've made a there's been a big

1754
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,440
leap and uh we'll jump into that in just

1755
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:17,519
one second something I I forgot I hadn't

1756
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,519
actually asked you at the start how rude

1757
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:24,038
of me what have you been smoking on

1758
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:26,079
recently uh the the piff S2 and the

1759
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:28,278
pineapple PFF and

1760
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,200
I just just ran out of those I've got

1761
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:32,239
some honey banana here next to me I've

1762
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:34,159
got some strawberry milk and

1763
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,639
cookies

1764
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:39,000
um yeah those have been been the main

1765
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:41,318
ones here recently that have been in my

1766
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,278
rotation look I love it some some

1767
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:45,159
beautiful examples in there you've

1768
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:47,079
you've mentioned you've been fond of and

1769
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:49,879
you're doing some work with the piff

1770
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:53,720
have you had a chance to try any of the

1771
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:57,440
other Infamous nl5 Haze um clones like

1772
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:57,439
maybe the C5 or the A5

1773
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:04,118
five no I wish I had i' I've got quite a

1774
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,480
collection of of seeds made with those

1775
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:08,559
but I haven't ran them yet I'm sure like

1776
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,400
you we probably have way more seeds than

1777
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:15,720
we could ever actually grow that's like

1778
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,600
I'm a seed hoarder collector I've got uh

1779
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:19,479
let's see one two three four five six

1780
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,560
seven

1781
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:25,278
eight got about 16 totes behind me with

1782
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,120
with seeds in them so I've got yeah just

1783
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,960
the

1784
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:31,880
My My My Life Investment is in seeds um

1785
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:33,279
but yeah no I have not ever experienced

1786
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,560
those even the piif I never got to

1787
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:39,080
experience until the past i''s say 18

1788
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:41,560
months or so and at first I was like

1789
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:43,679
this is interesting but the more I

1790
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:47,920
smoked with it the more it really really

1791
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,560
kind of got to me this particular FS2

1792
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,359
number three I think has something like

1793
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:54,719
7% thcv which i' never had before and so

1794
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,239
that's something I'm really excited to

1795
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:01,039
like work into Auto format um but yeah I

1796
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:04,238
I can't get enough of of the hazy

1797
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:06,319
stuff I went to pcon this this past year

1798
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:08,519
and that was oh man that was a hell of

1799
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:12,480
an event it blew me away I had

1800
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:14,000
expectations for it and it was far above

1801
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,838
and beyond anything I could have ever

1802
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,679
imagined it was massive um shout out to

1803
01:09:16,838 --> 01:09:20,559
piff Coast farms for putting that on and

1804
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:22,640
making the piff accessible to to

1805
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,279
everyone because growing up it was just

1806
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,239
something I'd hear about in rap songs I

1807
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:28,239
never you know thought I'd try it it

1808
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:30,559
almost became like is this even is this

1809
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:33,358
just a nickname like kind bud but to

1810
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,600
actually have it and be able to like

1811
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:39,798
smoke it on a a semi-regular basis now

1812
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,359
is yeah it it's maybe because of the

1813
01:09:39,798 --> 01:09:43,000
sentimental reasons of like growing up

1814
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,679
and not having access to it and hearing

1815
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
so much about it but it's special it's

1816
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,719
it's a good one yeah totally you know

1817
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,719
what's interesting I've been lucky

1818
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:53,640
enough to try the C5 and the A5 but I've

1819
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:55,679
never tried the piff so there you go on

1820
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,840
opposite ends of the spectrum and I

1821
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,840
definitely have recently been thinking

1822
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,319
you know shout out to piif Coast Farms

1823
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,600
it uh it's undeniable that pifc con has

1824
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:07,359
been a success and you know the fact

1825
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,120
that they're going even harder is a is a

1826
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,399
sign of how successful the prior ones

1827
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,319
are I'll probably have to get those guys

1828
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:15,920
on pretty soon I reckon yeah let me uh

1829

beautiful herb we've uh We've we've

1842
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:51,639
gotten so sidetracked I I best get us

1843
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:53,479
back on to our story which is what was

1844
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,719
your first Auto breeding was it

1845
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:57,039
intentional was it accidental lay the

1846
01:10:55,719 --> 01:11:02,480
landscape for

1847
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:04,920
me oh it was intentional um my first

1848
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:06,599
Auto to Auto stuff actually I didn't

1849
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:10,000
even start out with auto to Auto my

1850
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:12,880
first Auto breeding project was what

1851
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,399
would become a sour stomper for misto

1852
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,400
genetics and it was their sour crack

1853
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,879
that I had so in 2014 I moved my little

1854
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:23,920
cousin out to Denver Colorado and

1855
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,960
sampled probably 250 different strains

1856
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,719
of cannabis we we got there on the day

1857
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,640
that re stor is legally opened there's

1858
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,480
kind of this famous um Anderson Cooper

1859
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,920
He's a news anchor he was a news ancher

1860
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:37,959
over here I have no idea what he's doing

1861
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,960
now but he sent one of his reporters out

1862
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,198
to Denver to cover the opening of these

1863
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,520
pot shops is what they called them and

1864
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:49,519
she went on this like cannabis bus Flor

1865
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:51,360
from dispensary to dispensary and anyway

1866
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,280
the first place they stopped at me and

1867
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,759
my cousin were in line to get flower

1868
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:56,238
from so me and my little cousin are

1869
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,480
standing there like you can see the

1870
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:00,079
video online of us like in line waiting

1871
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,000
to get weed here as they're doing this

1872
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:05,279
tour and anyway this this went viral

1873
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
because she ended up getting high like

1874
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:10,079
and doing her news report super super

1875
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,880
laughy and chatty and you could see in

1876
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:13,439
her face she was just St like even

1877
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,319
Anderson Cooper called her out on it was

1878
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:19,839
like are you sure you didn't in Vibe at

1879
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:21,599
all and yeah so um during that time grap

1880
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:26,400
stomper was like my favorite of these

1881
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,280
like 200 250 strains that we tried so

1882
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,000
immediately when I got back to the east

1883
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:31,559
coast I started trying to Source those

1884
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,479
seeds and they were just sold out

1885
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,920
everywhere but I found there's a website

1886
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:39,718
called canazon out of the UK and they

1887
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,639
had a pack of grape stomper OG and it

1888
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:43,920
was their last pack they had of it and I

1889
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:45,840
got it I had them send it stealth and it

1890
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,920
came to me and it was a 10 seed pack I

1891
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,000
ended up getting like 12 or 13 seeds in

1892
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,399
it I reached out I was like man are you

1893
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,039
sure you sent me the right seeds like

1894
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,759
there was too many seeds in here like

1895
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:56,079
just super suspicious of the whole thing

1896
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,679
so like who would get seeds you know

1897
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:01,920
what I mean and so I I kept a mail from

1898
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:04,359
that in Maryland as I was growing down

1899
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,960
in South Carolina I had my buddy from

1900
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:09,119
high school kind of take over my garden

1901
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,158
there in Maryland he didn't even have a

1902
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,760
car his mom would drive him to this spot

1903
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:15,920
that I had and he would water the plants

1904
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,360
on a daily basis and I would drive 12

1905
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,880
hours one way each weekend to go up and

1906
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:21,679
take pictures of these plants to make

1907
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,039
sure everything was going all right but

1908
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:26,039
anyway there was a grape stomper mail

1909
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:27,479
that I didn't didn't know much about

1910
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:29,399
breeding i' had done a lot of research

1911
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:31,119
and you know it had tacky stems and you

1912
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:32,759
just rub it you could smell the grape

1913
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:34,198
even when it was in veg and I was like

1914
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:38,239
this is like there's something special

1915
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:40,039
with this so I kept that mail alive

1916
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,879
anyway down in South Carolina I had the

1917
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:45,960
sour crack growing a Tyrone stomper and

1918
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,679
some other stuff I was out for my job I

1919
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,439
usually would take my dog on the road

1920
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:52,119
with me every day but this day I left

1921
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:54,799
her home I was renting a house my dog

1922
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:57,198
was there I come home there's a note on

1923
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,199
the door saying you know this property

1924
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,359
is going to be inspected by the sheriffs

1925
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:03,678
this house is foreclosed on I was paying

1926
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:05,479
my landlord he wasn't paying the bank so

1927
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,960
the house I was in went into foreclosure

1928
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:10,519
without me being any wiser about the

1929
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,158
whole thing so I immediately took those

1930
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,760
two plants throw them in the back of a

1931
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,439
truck drove up to Maryland with them had

1932
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,480
him there and was like you know what

1933
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:21,279

1934
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:24,000

1951
01:15:03,158 --> 01:15:08,519
guys so I'd been following them online

1952
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:10,199
and their stuff was like the first stuff

1953
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,600
that was like damn this is a game

1954
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:16,000
changer for me this is like the next

1955
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:18,120
level autos and so we became friends on

1956
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,238
autoflower.net I'd followed them on

1957
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:21,920
Mitch on there and on IC mag and was

1958
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:23,678
just a big fan of everything that he was

1959
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,600
doing he was you could tell he was doing

1960
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:28,399
it right and he was doing the proper

1961
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,199
selections and and running numbers and

1962
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,079
doing real true breeding work to make

1963
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:34,479
this plant better and that really spoke

1964
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:36,639
to me so I started growing all their

1965
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:38,559
stuff I would document the [ __ ] out of

1966
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:40,719
it because that was I was like super OCD

1967
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,920
about that I would get the VPN and like

1968
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,719
run all my pictures through imager to

1969
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:48,199
erase all the exit data and all that

1970
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:51,158
stuff and uh we just became like friends

1971
01:15:48,198 --> 01:15:52,519
that way and that's uh I asked him

1972
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:55,079
before I did the pollination like do you

1973
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,320
mind if I do this or whatever and I sent

1974
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:59,238
him the F1 seeds and he gr out was like

1975
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:01,158
dude these are like the frostiest plants

1976
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:02,959
we've ever seen like these are amazing

1977
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:05,599
and so he I was like that's my gift to

1978
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,840
you at the time I was trying to get a a

1979
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,679
license to grow in Maryland because they

1980
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,440
were about to go legal and I had him

1981
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,399
write me a nice little um kind of

1982
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,238
recommendation review thing that I could

1983
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:20,399
give to potential employers people that

1984
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,638
got licenses that like put me in a good

1985
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,119
light and said you know this dude knows

1986
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:25,920
what he's doing but in a professional

1987
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:28,760
professional way

1988

2024
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:01,119
there was an incident with some guns

2025
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:04,000
involved whatever the cops came out they

2026
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:06,960
said look you you you're in a stand your

2027

ground state your armed I have a little

2028
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,279
bit of a background in competitive

2029
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:12,599
shooting I have my concealed carryer

2030
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:14,519
permit all the like I did it all the

2031
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,800
right way you know don't break the law

2032
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,920
while you're breaking the law sort of

2033
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,360
thing so um yeah anyway the cop

2034
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,960
basically told me to shoot this person

2035
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:24,960
the next time they came over and started

2036
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:26,639
[ __ ] and I was just like threw all my my

2037
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,279
training I was like I don't want to go

2038
01:18:26,639 --> 01:18:32,000
through that emotionally I know like the

2039
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,679
consequences of that on a person to like

2040
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,719
put themselves in that situation but

2041
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:41,960
also I want to protect myself and my

2042
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:43,198
family and whatever so anyway next day

2043

2044
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:48,079

01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:16,158
of jail known criminal but he was like

2084
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:18,319
friends with the police officers so much

2085
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:20,119
so that the night prior it took us like

2086
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:22,158
four hours to actually get a cop to come

2087
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:24,000
out to even like talk to us because he

2088
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:26,638
had called in and told his side of the

2089
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,800
story and they were like well you know

2090
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,359
there's no need for us to go out

2091
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,600
everything's fine blah blah blah

2092
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:34,279
anyway the person that they wanted to

2093
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,039
press charges on me as I'm sitting in

2094
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:38,319
the back of the car they're trying to

2095
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:40,198
call they couldn't get a hold of him two

2096
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:41,719
hours goes by they're not listening to

2097
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:43,119
me I'm trying to explain my side of the

2098
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:46,079
story through the back of the cop car

2099
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:47,800
window they're just [ __ ] this kid out of

2100
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:49,719
town or blah blah blah

2101
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,840
whatever eventually they get a hold of

2102
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:53,239
the dude and the dude was like no he was

2103
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,480
standing his ground he was on his

2104
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:56,479
property he did nothing wrong I don't

2105
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:58,759
want to press charges they let me go

2106
01:20:56,479 --> 01:21:00,279
gave my gun back I didn't have any keys

2107
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:02,719
on me to go in the house so I had to sit

2108
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:04,479
outside without a phone and a snowy West

2109
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,560
Virginia holler for like three hours

2110
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:07,879
until my chick got home from work she's

2111
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,039
like I was trying to call and text you I

2112
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:12,000
knew something was wrong but anyway that

2113
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:14,198
was like the writing on the wall of I

2114
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,719
got to get to a legal place and a legal

2115
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:19,399
State and that's when I I decided you

2116
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:22,198
know [ __ ] this I'm I'm done taking these

2117
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:24,799
risks like this and that was like time

2118
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:27,359
to go to Colorado that was kind of how

2119
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:30,400
that all happened um what' you ask let

2120
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,839
me get back to to the the actual

2121
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:35,439
question no no that was it that was it

2122
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:37,119
how you got hooked in with mempa okay so

2123
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:39,198
I wonder what what are some of the

2124
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:41,399
standout strains from that period that

2125
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:45,439
you really stand behind and think were

2126
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:47,399
are just awesome witho stuff yeah just

2127
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:50,279
any of that early stuff you worked

2128
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:51,679
on I I love the sour stomper to this day

2129
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:55,238
it's one of my favorites it's it's an

2130
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,800
amazing strain um I've got a lot of of

2131
01:21:55,238 --> 01:22:01,519
love and respect for what I did with

2132
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,880
those guys um I think they they're like

2133
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,000
that some of their stuff's been the high

2134
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,039
water mark for a lot of the Autos

2135
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,600
especially at the time like the the

2136
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,719
Ripley's OG the Walter White a lot of

2137
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,320
their older stuff was just phenomenal I

2138
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:16,000
haven't kept up too much with any of

2139
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:18,880
their their newer stuff but I still go

2140
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,840
back and Dabble in my old Mesto seed

2141
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,000
stock even before then um secret garden

2142
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,480
seeds was like another company that that

2143
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,679
Mitch had before Mesto and I've still

2144
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:31,479
got my auto stock from from them from

2145
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:34,760
back in the day and like I I I have a

2146
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:37,079
lot of respect uh and a lot of

2147
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,800
sentimental you know value in those

2148
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:41,279
seeds for me and I I still love them to

2149
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,480
this day and still still go back and and

2150
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:46,198
check them out every once in a while but

2151
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:48,198
yeah the uh the the sour Stamper for

2152
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:52,439
sure the Walter White the

2153
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:55,359
Ripley um they were all really really

2154
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:57,479
nice yeah some some incredibly memorable

2155
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:59,279
strains there that even in Australia I

2156
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:01,238
remember we're getting grown out quite a

2157
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:03,840
bit so shout out to all the people who

2158
01:23:01,238 --> 01:23:05,839
got to enjoy that so you know I guess at

2159
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,920
a certain point that chapter wrapped up

2160
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,760
for you and and you moved on to night

2161
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:13,399
hour what was the inspiration for

2162
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:16,480
starting your own project night

2163
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:19,119
hour um we just kind of

2164
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:21,359
had creative differences I guess is the

2165
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,359
most diplomatic way to put it um

2166
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:25,238
different Visions for how the company

2167
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:26,920
should proceed

2168
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:31,198
um we should move

2169
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:32,880
forward um yeah I don't really want to

2170
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:35,119
get too deep into it but yeah let's just

2171
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:38,039
say creative

2172
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:40,198
differences sure sure and so what was

2173
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:42,760
the first project you worked on under

2174
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:45,519
the name night out at least in your

2175
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,760
mind uh the Wizards Apprentice the blue

2176
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,040
microverse and the zelica express were

2177
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:53,119
my first night owl releases I released

2178
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:55,158
those all at the same time um so that's

2179
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:58,000
the the blue microverse was blue Mago

2180
01:23:55,158 --> 01:23:59,519
bx2 from Dynasty who's like you know

2181
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,920
another Legend in my eyes it was an

2182
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,480
absolute honor to to work with his gear

2183
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,119
and you know to have him comment on like

2184
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:08,399
photos of my stuff and be like damn that

2185
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:11,079
looks like the blue Mago and like I

2186
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:12,719
don't know it was just it it gave me the

2187
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:14,399
it was like the wind beneath my wings to

2188
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:15,800
to keep moving and you know know I was

2189
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,519
doing the right thing and going in the

2190
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,600
right direction um yeah the Wizard's

2191
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:24,440
Apprentice was a chich wizard from Bodie

2192
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,679
that I worked in the auto format and

2193
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:29,559
yeah everyone loves bod myself included

2194
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:31,920
nothing but admiration for all he's done

2195
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,920
like I think he's he's an unsung hero

2196
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,719
especially nowadays I feel like he

2197
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,039
doesn't get the the reverence he

2198
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:41,279
deserves um but yeah he's phenomenal

2199
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:44,279
he's an amazing amazing cat and I hope

2200
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:46,719
to one day shake his hand he's he's he's

2201
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,840
a special dude for sure um and then yeah

2202
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:51,039
the zelica express which is the the

2203
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:53,600
zelica from a seeds worked into Auto

2204
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:56,000
format and again just the the land race

2205
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,760
sativa stuff was just that's special you

2206
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,840
know what I mean like everything I do is

2207
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,920
something that I really want to do and

2208
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,600
enjoy and that that that's what it boils

2209
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,399
down to is just these are things that I

2210
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,039
love and it's it's a really special

2211
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:11,118
feeling to bring something new into the

2212
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:14,198
world that hasn't existed before and

2213
01:25:11,118 --> 01:25:16,920
it's like it artists do it chefs do it

2214
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:18,799
and you know cannabis breeders do it and

2215
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:22,840
it's just it's it's a really cool thing

2216
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:26,360
to experience and and

2217
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:29,920
behold yeah to look so many epic points

2218
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:31,880
in there and you know mad love for bod

2219
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,679
he's I I think he's made of pure love

2220
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,560
and light and I agree with everything

2221
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:40,840
you said he's just a pillar in the scene

2222
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:43,159
and uh Professor P 100% you know still

2223
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:45,360
one of the few breeders in my tier one

2224
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:47,599
category and anyone who listens to the

2225
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:50,960
show will know that I I love the blue

2226
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:54,520
magu Lon I I for me very biased opinion

2227
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:57,279
but I think Blue Heron blue meu bx2 the

2228
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:59,520
best seed lines you can buy I want to

2229
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:01,359
ask you you know moving on to some of

2230
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,480
the incredible work that we see under

2231
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:06,920
the banner of night hour if you couldn't

2232
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:09,439
know any specific details about the

2233
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:11,600
grower but could only recommend one pack

2234
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:13,118
of your seeds for someone what pack

2235
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,440
would you recommend just as I guess a

2236
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:15,439
general

2237
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,440
allrounder probably the strawberry milk

2238
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:24,439
and cookies remix because that's the

2239
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:27,439
version that's currently available it's

2240
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:31,479
a flower that will make you say damn

2241
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:33,198
this is an auto flower it there's it's

2242
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:37,279
frosty as all get out it's got

2243
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:39,559
incredible turps um it it grow it's not

2244
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:43,158
the most it's not the biggest plant

2245
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:47,039
overall but it's the quintessential Auto

2246
01:26:43,158 --> 01:26:49,599
flower as far as you know structure and

2247
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:51,800
it's just overall an amazing plant so

2248
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,119
that would probably be my go-to

2249
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:57,760
recommendation for what's currently

2250
01:26:55,118 --> 01:26:59,559
available worldwide uh out of my catalog

2251
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,320
for someone that's never grown in Auto

2252
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,000
just yeah that's what my guts telling me

2253
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:07,198
to say right

2254
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,359
now I Lov that cuz I was uh lucky enough

2255
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:10,759
to try some of the original and

2256
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:13,920
hopefully I'll be lucky enough to try

2257
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:16,440
some of the remix and it it was truly a

2258
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:19,520
beautiful strain you know and I guess I

2259
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:22,479
wanted to ask for any breeder there's a

2260
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,719
few strains that just really seem to hit

2261
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:27,638
and and I had jotted down a few um

2262
01:27:25,719 --> 01:27:29,319
Cosmic Queen was another one that I felt

2263
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:31,039
really hit with the audience at least in

2264
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:33,319
terms of what I could see and and

2265
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:35,319
Marathon OG what do you think it is

2266
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:37,960
about these certain strains that really

2267
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:40,519
seem to become super

2268
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:43,000
popular the cosmic Queen

2269
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:45,760
is with with with a few of my strands

2270
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,920
it's like there's there's nothing else

2271
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,679
like it on on the market there's nothing

2272
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:54,239
else it's you just don't find these

2273
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:56,279
flavors um it's like a honeysuckle

2274
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,079
suntan lotion

2275
01:27:56,279 --> 01:28:01,840
creamy just something special that you

2276
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:03,399
you just it it catches you off guard

2277
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,039
where you're like what the [ __ ] is this

2278
01:28:03,399 --> 01:28:07,198
man this is like I can't even pinpoint a

2279
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:08,479
single flavor and through the Cure even

2280
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:11,919
the flavor will change it'll get

2281
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:14,079
cheesier and funkier and um I think

2282
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:17,079
people love that they love the resin

2283
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:20,158
production of it they love the flow but

2284
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:22,800
really the that one in particular is is

2285
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:25,719
super uplifting sativa dominant just

2286
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,639
really amazing nice euphoric effects um

2287
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:32,600
the marathon OG was like the first in my

2288
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:37,719
opinion really true OG Auto where it was

2289
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:41,360
like damn this is like super OG um it's

2290
01:28:37,719 --> 01:28:45,000
a big yielder super dense OG nugs just

2291
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:47,158
the the TPS are there um what what was

2292
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,039
was there another one you mentioned oh

2293
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:50,879
and I also had the the milk and cookies

2294
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:52,118
on the list I mean there's so many but

2295
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,319
those were just certainly some of the

2296
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:56,118
ones that I've seen very represented by

2297
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:58,158
people is grown and

2298
01:28:56,118 --> 01:29:01,559
loved yeah I think they they catch

2299
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:03,118
people off guard and and they're strong

2300
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,560
they they have amazing effects they have

2301
01:29:03,118 --> 01:29:08,439
amazing flavor they grow well and it's

2302
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,280
people don't expect that from an auto

2303
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:11,638
and when they get it that it it really

2304
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:14,439
resonates with

2305
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:16,359
people yeah totally totally and and I'm

2306
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:19,319
sure you know you're you're lucky enough

2307
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:22,000
to have that feeling quite often I'm on

2308
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:24,479
your website now I can see that the uh

2309
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,439
the Halloween drop with the blue Power

2310
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:29,479
is coming it's just one of the many

2311
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:31,678
collabs you've done obviously Sin City

2312
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:33,519
super well regarded I call them a bit of

2313
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,520
a darkh horse breeders breeder cuz you

2314
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,440
find their work pop up in other breeders

2315
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:40,600
works and it flies under the radar like

2316
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:44,039
you know in cush mins there's C cities

2317
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:47,119
work in there anyway um tell me a bit

2318
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:49,000
about this blue Power Drop and uh what

2319
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:50,599
would you re like what sort of traits

2320
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,198
does it bring to the table what would

2321
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,960
people get excited

2322
01:29:52,198 --> 01:29:57,399
for I definitely agree that he's kind of

2323
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,399
another one of the the unsung heroes

2324
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:01,079
that's putting in the work and and you

2325
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:04,719
know just doing it quietly and and

2326
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:06,519
staying in his own lane and um yeah he's

2327
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,399
a phenomenal dude I I got to hang out

2328
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,360
with him a couple times him and his wife

2329
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,079
and they're they're great people we

2330
01:30:10,359 --> 01:30:13,920
really H it off we had similar

2331
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:17,519
backgrounds with like skateboarding and

2332
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:19,920
music and stuff so he's just a a super

2333
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,400
good dude overall but with the blue

2334
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,920
Power Man it's really kind of a

2335
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:30,359
blueberry Master Cush just really really

2336
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:33,760
nice incredibly resinous hearty heavy

2337
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:36,880
hitting just overall fantastic plant um

2338
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:40,360
it's got super fat almost like afghanica

2339
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:43,359
style leaves um super nice dark foliage

2340
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:45,439
it fades beautifully and uh the resin

2341
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:47,158
heads fall off it as I was breaking up

2342
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:49,919
seeds of it earlier just man it's going

2343
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:51,638
to be such a nice such a nice extractor

2344
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,560
um I ran a couple through through my

2345
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:55,840
little tumbler before deeding and yeah

2346
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:56,920
they they they dumped heads so I'm

2347
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,840
expecting good things for the

2348
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:00,520
solventless guys with that one which

2349
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:02,639
also yeah the the strawberry milk and

2350
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,880
cookies and the remix are also both

2351
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:08,118
really nice washers um that's something

2352
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:09,880
I've kind of tried to to start focusing

2353
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:11,319
on more over the past couple years

2354
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:14,199
because it seems like you know that's

2355
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:16,559
where the Market's going as opposed to

2356
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:18,638
back in my Heyday getting out the the

2357
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,199
glass tube and Blasting away and taking

2358
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:22,880
it to the back oven and purging and that

2359
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:25,678
whole process was like a ritual to me

2360
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,039
man I used to love chopping a a a plant

2361
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,000
throwing it in the little cooler with

2362
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:31,079
some dry ice and freezing it up and then

2363
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,319
packing the tube and refreezing it and

2364
01:31:31,079 --> 01:31:36,439
going out to town just blasting away but

2365
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:39,479
yeah the the solventless stuff is really

2366
01:31:36,439 --> 01:31:41,638
taken off and um people have found some

2367
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:43,959
really good good Watchers in my stuff

2368
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:46,118
one of my my buddies Growers down in

2369
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:47,880
Virginia he swears by the strawberry

2370
01:31:46,118 --> 01:31:50,639
milk and cookies and it's like

2371
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:54,000
strawberry milk strawberry Nest flavored

2372
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:56,800
hash and dumps he gets like six% returns

2373
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,920
one of his buddies in Colorado got like

2374
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,480
eight and a half percent Returns on a

2375
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:03,000
wizard stash remix and he actually just

2376
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:04,399
sent me up recently being like man I'm

2377
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,960
really looking forward to the the blue

2378
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:09,599
Power stuff and yeah uh the solventless

2379
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,399
stuff has just taken off so while I'm

2380
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,880
not focus solely on that because I feel

2381
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:16,158
like there's that's kind of a byproduct

2382
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,159
of some of the photo periods that I'm

2383
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:19,839
working with naturally if I do my part

2384
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,719
properly that trade's going to carry

2385
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:25,039
over and since I don't wash myself it's

2386
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:27,000
not something I've ever been like I need

2387
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,439
to breed specifically for this but it is

2388
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,880
something that I do keep in mind now

2389
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:30,879
during my

2390
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,479
selections yeah you got me wondering do

2391
01:32:33,079 --> 01:32:38,639
we need to see like uh Mountain trop cut

2392
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:41,039
of Tropicana cookies Autos you know like

2393
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,600
it's such an infamously famous washer

2394
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:47,000
that uh you just set yourself up for

2395
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,960
success but um I wanted to to ask you

2396
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,880
you know on that topic are you much of a

2397
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,158
concentrates guy if so what's your

2398
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:57,239
preferred type of concentrate

2399
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:59,238
so I used to dab exclusively pretty much

2400
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:01,799
well I mean I went from flower to

2401
01:32:59,238 --> 01:33:04,638
dabbing and then when I went to Spain it

2402
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,760
was like an unknown thing over there so

2403
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:09,039
I brought like a couple rigs over there

2404
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,280
to like give to the guys and they were

2405
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,439
like what what is this what do we do

2406
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:14,920
with this and so over there I like

2407
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:16,879
bought a whole setup to blast and it

2408
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,600
kind of like changed changed a little

2409
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,560
bit of the game for them in some

2410
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,320
respects

2411
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:24,080
because well I don't want to speak out

2412
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:28,158
of school here so I should probably let

2413
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:30,800
let them tell their story um but yeah

2414
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:32,920
that uh the dabbing was a huge part of

2415
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,840
my life I used to love glass there was a

2416
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,960
a glass blower named Doom glass that was

2417
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,719
just one of my all-time favorites and

2418
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,198
he's kind of vanished off the face of

2419
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,600
the Earth the past few years I actually

2420
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:45,319
went on Instagram and searched his

2421
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:47,400
hashtag Rec recently and found like the

2422
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:49,359
most recent post of him with somebody in

2423
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:51,399
it and reached out that I was like Hey

2424
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:53,839
know is this dude all right like yeah

2425
01:33:51,399 --> 01:34:00,359
he's just taking a break but yeah I I

2426
01:33:53,840 --> 01:34:02,560
loved D and and live rosin and I love uh

2427
01:34:00,359 --> 01:34:04,559
just all of it I don't dabble with much

2428
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,199
anymore I've got my little puffco proxy

2429
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,480
pipe that I love and that's my my go-to

2430
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,839
as far as dabbing now um but yeah and

2431
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:14,439
the mountain trap that was like my

2432
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,760
favorite strain for years and years and

2433
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:18,158
I love that one and I'm a very I try to

2434
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,719
be as respectful as possible with

2435
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:22,679
breeding so I reached out to to Oni we

2436
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:25,239
did some trades I was like man I'd love

2437
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:27,800
to to work this trap cut and it was like

2438
01:34:25,238 --> 01:34:29,439
during the time that him and Joey were

2439
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:32,480
like had their little kind of falling

2440
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:35,238
out um Harry Palms went his way Onie

2441
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:37,198
went his way Onie said yeah you know

2442
01:34:35,238 --> 01:34:39,198
I'll get it to you Terry said yeah I'll

2443
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:40,919
get it to you I met up with somebody

2444
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:44,559
that was like a mutual friend of theirs

2445
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:46,158
to get it they gave me the wrong cut um

2446
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,480
so then after I ran that it was the

2447
01:34:46,158 --> 01:34:49,079
wrong thing I reached back out to both

2448
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:51,479
of them and at this point they were like

2449
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:53,079
had nothing to do with each other and I

2450
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:54,599
told both of them out of respect that I

2451
01:34:53,079 --> 01:34:56,559
reached out to both of them hoping to

2452
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,679
get it from one of them to work with and

2453
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,360
like I think that pissed off both of

2454
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:02,279
them so I kind of shot myself in the

2455
01:35:00,359 --> 01:35:05,039
foot there being like

2456
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:06,920
too respectful or cautious or wanting to

2457
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,000
do the right thing and it it kind of

2458
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:10,679
like pushed them both away but I've ran

2459
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,520
into Harry palom since then and been

2460
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:15,000
like man like I'd love to to work

2461
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:16,840
something still I know for a while they

2462
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,319
both kind of went their separate ways

2463
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,520
from the trap and now it seems like

2464
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:22,118
they're kind of starting to come back

2465
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,800
around to the trout but yeah that that

2466
01:35:22,118 --> 01:35:26,519
was one of my favorite sering for a long

2467
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:28,520
long time and I really kind of got

2468
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:32,239
bummed out that I I didn't work with it

2469
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:34,480
it's still something I'd love to do um I

2470
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:36,118
know there's some I believe there's some

2471
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,718
other trop Autos out there that I

2472
01:35:36,118 --> 01:35:41,519
haven't tried just because I kind of

2473
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:44,800
stick to my own stuff just to to for

2474
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:46,119
whatever reason um but yeah I'd love to

2475
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,679
work with that one still and it's funny

2476
01:35:46,118 --> 01:35:50,238
that you bring that up because I still

2477
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:52,520
to this day would love to to work with

2478
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:54,319
that actually had some chop Cherry just

2479
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:56,679
the other night I I I went down to New

2480
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:59,000
York and met up with some people and had

2481
01:35:56,679 --> 01:36:00,719
some trap Cherry there like man I forgot

2482
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,960
how much I love this [ __ ] Tropic can

2483
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,079

2490
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:19,599
said I've been a fan of of yours on the

2491
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:21,600
podcast since the very first episode you

2492
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,119
you've been my uh my best friend in the

2493
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,840
garden many lonely nights so I

2494
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:27,479
appreciate what you do oh thank you I

2495
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,279
was I was just having a joke there but

2496
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:30,759
that's very that's very lovely to hear

2497
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:32,840
that and you know what when you were

2498
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,199
talking earlier about trimming the weed

2499
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:35,199
when the cop broke down your door I was

2500
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:36,519
going to say I hope you weren't

2501
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:39,279
listening to me I don't want to be

2502
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:41,760
associated with

2503
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:44,279
trauma yeah no that I don't have you

2504
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,079
associate I was listening to a a show

2505
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:47,319
called Ron and Fez at the time actually

2506
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:49,760
I remember specifically what I was

2507
01:36:47,319 --> 01:36:51,960
listening to to so yeah you're in the

2508
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:55,280
clear see what I mean I knew I knew you

2509
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:55,279
would have remembered

2510
01:36:55,719 --> 01:36:59,279
there you go there you go okay well no

2511
01:36:57,319 --> 01:37:00,759
look I'm I'm we we've had a friendship

2512
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:02,198
for a number of years and it's it's been

2513
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,560
awesome and I'm so glad we're we're

2514
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:05,839
finally doing this um I guess you know

2515
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,679
while we're talking about you were

2516
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:12,079
saying there's some other trop Autos out

2517
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:15,560
there I feel like a lot of the uh bulk

2518
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:16,880
sort of Cheaper largely speaking just as

2519
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,000
a general rule of thumb what you might

2520
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:23,159
call sort of European originated Auto

2521
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,158
seed probably mostly from Spain um a lot

2522
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:28,799
of it is is obviously nowhere near the

2523
01:37:25,158 --> 01:37:31,279
level of nightow of misto and I guess a

2524
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,039
lot of those former negative a lot of

2525
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:36,198
those things you hear about Autos that

2526
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:38,399
were related to the the European stock

2527
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:40,238
do you think that's just an artifact of

2528
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:42,559
the fact that like some of those initial

2529
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:44,598
breedings were not done that well and

2530
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,960
it's just carried over ever since like

2531
01:37:44,599 --> 01:37:50,520
is that just a rational explanation or

2532
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:53,560
do you think like it's more complex than

2533
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:58,520
that I I think the game's changed now

2534
01:37:53,560 --> 01:38:01,880
now I think those bulk breeders have

2535
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:04,440
seen what the the good Autos are and now

2536
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:06,840
buy those seeds and and knock those off

2537
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:09,198
so that they do have walk stuff that's

2538
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:11,960
like much better than it used to be but

2539
01:38:09,198 --> 01:38:13,678
at the end of the day any bulk anything

2540
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,560
is never going to be good as something

2541
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,039
Boutique and that's actually has some

2542
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,159
intention behind it as far as the

2543
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:21,399
selections are going like that's kind of

2544
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:23,598
the problem with I have someone reach

2545
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:26,118
out to me every other month saying hey

2546
01:38:23,599 --> 01:38:27,639
got a million seeds would you want to

2547
01:38:26,118 --> 01:38:28,839
you know buy some of these we' run them

2548
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:31,079
to you you want to sell them put your

2549
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,840
name on it whatever and it's just like

2550
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:37,158
never no why would I ever that's there's

2551
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,719
so much it's such a personal thing it's

2552
01:38:37,158 --> 01:38:40,238
such a personal relationship with this

2553
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:43,079
plant and the selection like I said

2554
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:47,198
earlier is so much defined by the pallet

2555
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:49,479
of a person so to see these excuse me

2556
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:52,158
these huge Auto Farms these outdoor

2557
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:54,399
Farms where they're reversing a thousand

2558
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:57,559
plants and pollinating five ,000 plants

2559
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:59,598
getting however many millions of seeds

2560
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:02,719
and then combining them all into one

2561
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:03,920
seed stock is just crazy to me like I

2562
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,920
get it there's there's always going to

2563
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,520
be a market for that and these people

2564
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:11,679
spend their money on promotion rather

2565
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,679
than actually doing the breeding stuff

2566
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:15,880
and I it's it's always going to be a

2567
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:18,319
thing there's always going to be a new

2568
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:20,440
company coming in um there's always

2569
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,039
going to be people doing white labeling

2570
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:24,118
stuff it's just it's part of the

2571
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:26,359
industry at this point and

2572
01:39:24,118 --> 01:39:29,639
you know it is what it is

2573
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:31,039
it's a difference between you know again

2574
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:35,599
the intentional pollination and

2575
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:37,840
selection and having a a discriminating

2576
01:39:35,599 --> 01:39:39,560
pallet versus we're just trying to make

2577
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,400
as many seeds as possible for as cheap

2578
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:44,280
as possible to sell them for as much as

2579
01:39:41,399 --> 01:39:46,079
possible so I don't know my buddy was

2580
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:47,719
down in a hydro shop in DC sent me a

2581
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,920
picture the other day he's like for

2582
01:39:47,719 --> 01:39:53,399
every excuse me for every1 you spend you

2583
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:55,639
get to stick your hand in a box and

2584
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:57,559
grabbed a random pack of seeds or three

2585
01:39:55,639 --> 01:40:00,639
random packs of seeds it was and the

2586
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:02,800
seeds he pulled out were auto companies

2587
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:05,400
that you and I both know very well and

2588
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:08,440
it was just amazing to me to see what

2589
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:09,960
kind of level it I was talking to Sin

2590
01:40:08,439 --> 01:40:11,598
City about this earlier tonight actually

2591
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,198
it's it's a race to the bottom with

2592
01:40:11,599 --> 01:40:17,560
Autos these days

2593
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:22,519
because the sharks have seen what what

2594
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:24,560
good autof flowers do and the the

2595
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:26,560
Autoflower community has been like the

2596
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:29,159
the bastard stepchild of the Cannabis

2597
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,320
scene its entire existence they've never

2598
01:40:29,158 --> 01:40:33,960
been given like any respect or any

2599
01:40:31,319 --> 01:40:35,399
credit or anything it's always like you

2600
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,319
mentioned earlier oh they're for

2601
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:38,638
beginners and only you know beginners

2602
01:40:37,319 --> 01:40:41,198
grow these and it's even to the point

2603
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:43,840
where they're like the hate for it is so

2604
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:45,719
strong that it's kind of alienated us

2605
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,079
into our own little Community that's

2606
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:48,560
almost separate from the Cannabis

2607
01:40:47,079 --> 01:40:52,679
Community it's like the Autoflower

2608
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:56,159
community and the Cannabis community so

2609
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:58,520
people see and they want in on it and

2610
01:40:56,158 --> 01:41:00,118
yeah it's just it it's they're like well

2611
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:02,560
let's take the best seeds that we can

2612
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:04,920
buy and reproduce them and mass without

2613
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,440
a care for anything other than just the

2614
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,599
quantity of the seeds at the end of the

2615
01:41:06,439 --> 01:41:10,719
day let's get some cool packaging to put

2616
01:41:08,599 --> 01:41:13,079
them in let's name them something catchy

2617
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:14,679
and let's just sell them for as cheap as

2618
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:16,960
possible if you

2619
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:20,079
see the some of these companies and the

2620
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:22,079
amount of seeds they give out you buy a

2621
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:25,960
pack of seeds for 40 bucks and end up

2622
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:27,279
getting you know 20 seeds for that you

2623
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,880
can just tell that's a white label

2624
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:32,000
company that's like that's all B stuff

2625
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:34,760
you know what I mean there's no way you

2626
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,679
can't afford the overhead of an actual

2627
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:39,039
true like breeding situation with Autos

2628
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,279
they just don't yield the same amount of

2629
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:43,079
seeds that a photo period does if you're

2630
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:44,840
doing selections you're not pollinating

2631
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:47,439
every single thing or if you are

2632
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:49,000
pollinating every single thing you're

2633
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:50,638
testing the plants afterward you're

2634
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,880
smoking the seated Bud to figure out

2635
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:53,920
what's what what's the best and you're

2636
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:55,840
releasing the best at least that's how I

2637
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,560
do it so a lot of these companies just

2638
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:01,239
release everything they put it all into

2639
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:03,560
one like I said there there's so much uh

2640
01:42:01,238 --> 01:42:05,718
phenotypic variation in some strains and

2641
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:07,080
in some generations in particular if you

2642
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:11,000
just combine them all together and call

2643
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:13,359
it one thing it's it's it's impossible

2644
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,238
to recreate or to to really do that

2645
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:18,158
because there's now you can have in a

2646
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:20,399
pack of of five seeds five different

2647
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,719
phenotypes and I don't know it's just

2648
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:23,638
it's a different way of doing things

2649
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:29,239
than I do they they'll always be a

2650
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:30,840
market for it um but yeah it's a it it

2651
01:42:29,238 --> 01:42:33,238
seems to be a race to the bottom right

2652
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:35,000
now in the auto Autoflower world and it

2653
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:37,319
almost reminds me of kind of like the

2654
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,920
big multi-state operators in the

2655
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:42,319
dispensary world coming in selling stuff

2656
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:43,719
at a loss to get rid of the the local

2657
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:45,559
competition who's actually putting in

2658
01:42:43,719 --> 01:42:46,960
the work has the heart and the soul and

2659
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,239
the passion and are putting out the good

2660
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,719
product but have to charge more for it

2661
01:42:49,238 --> 01:42:52,359
because you know they just have that

2662
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:54,639
higher overhead and don't have this

2663
01:42:52,359 --> 01:42:55,960
reserve of money they're just sitting on

2664
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:57,920
to get rid of the rest of the

2665
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:59,719
competition which that's kind of where

2666
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:03,319
we're at right now in the auto world is

2667
01:42:59,719 --> 01:43:04,920
just the the big bucks the the the Chads

2668
01:43:03,319 --> 01:43:08,439
or whatever you want to refer to them as

2669
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:10,520
are here and a lot of them are very

2670
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:13,919
deceptive in their marketing to make it

2671
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:17,880
seem like it's not what it is but if

2672
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,440
you're able to like I said kind of see

2673
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:21,400
the marketing schemes and the way that

2674
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:24,479
they're doing things and just the sheer

2675
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:26,638
volume of seeds that they can afford to

2676
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:29,439
give away it's just a completely

2677
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:31,400
different it that's that that's not what

2678
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:34,319
I do and I'll never be able to do that

2679
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:35,719
and yeah I just it's it it hurts my soul

2680
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:37,039
a little bit to see but it also makes me

2681
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:38,840
happy that it's bringing new people into

2682
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:40,800
the Autoflower world because once they

2683
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,560
get hooked then they do their research

2684
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,560
and then they find night owl and it's

2685
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:47,480
like wow I wish I knew about this sooner

2686
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:49,440
but I'm glad I'm here now yeah yeah

2687
01:43:47,479 --> 01:43:51,359
that's such an interesting perspective I

2688
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:53,638
I have to admit I feel quite enlightened

2689
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:56,198
to hear all of that because as you said

2690
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:58,560
there is a bit of a subdivision and it

2691
01:43:56,198 --> 01:44:00,638
and it can at times feel a bit like

2692
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,000
grower verse Autoflower grower you know

2693
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:05,159
what I mean and um when you say all of

2694
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,238
those points all of them resonate you

2695
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:09,839
know I can completely appreciate all of

2696
01:44:07,238 --> 01:44:12,000
what you said and to be honest I I think

2697
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:15,239
there's honestly a bit of a race to the

2698
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,679
bottom in in even in photo periods you

2699
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:20,959
know like all power to him but it was

2700
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:23,199
just a few weeks ago we saw Top Dog post

2701
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:26,198
about I'm getting back to a day job

2702
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,638
because things are changing and credit

2703
01:44:26,198 --> 01:44:29,359
to him and there was other many other

2704
01:44:27,639 --> 01:44:31,199
breeders in the comments who shared that

2705
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:33,559
same sentiment you know I know skun VA

2706
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:36,319
used to be working as an electrician for

2707
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:39,960
many years cuz he was like you know why

2708
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:44,319
not I wanted to to sort of pivot for a

2709
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:47,239
second and and ask you I think your

2710
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:48,840
Instagram account has to be one of the

2711
01:44:47,238 --> 01:44:50,759
most faked ones out there you know

2712
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:53,079
there's a few people I think cap he's

2713
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:55,000
another guy but like you you were

2714
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:57,238
definitely in the contention up there

2715
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,319
you know I think I I like to pride

2716
01:44:57,238 --> 01:45:02,079
myself on never following the fake

2717
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:03,960
account because you know give social

2718
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,880
vouch and other people follow it and I

2719
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:08,198
like to think I'm a good enough little

2720
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:10,239
Instagram detective that it's pretty

2721
01:45:08,198 --> 01:45:11,879
clear anyway one time I got caught out

2722
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:13,839
I'll be honest one time I got caught out

2723
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:16,920
I followed the fake one I'm

2724
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:19,360
sorry but uh I want to know from your

2725
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:22,719
point of view what's it been like to

2726
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,799
have so many people like cuz it seems

2727
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:25,800
like

2728
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:27,880
I have to assume that these scammers are

2729
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,440
getting sales because that's why they

2730
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:33,199
keep doing you

2731
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:35,638
right flattering it's I'm dude I'm one

2732
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:37,279
person I don't I live with myself every

2733
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:38,639
day so I don't see myself as anything

2734
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:41,118
particularly special you know what I

2735
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:43,118
mean I'm just a person I'm just doing

2736
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:47,198
the work that I want to be doing so to

2737
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:49,759
see other people that are copying and

2738
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:52,039
and completely taking my profile and

2739
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:54,560
making it their own and doing tricky

2740
01:45:52,039 --> 01:45:57,399
stuff with like you know using a capital

2741
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:59,520
I to make it look like an L or using a

2742
01:45:57,399 --> 01:46:01,399
period in the wrong place or whatever

2743
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,040
like they've fooled me before I was like

2744
01:46:01,399 --> 01:46:05,198
is this my account like I tagged the

2745
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:07,279
wrong account before so you know don't

2746
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:10,238
feel bad about that I've done it too but

2747
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:11,800
it is a tricky thing to navigate and to

2748
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,718
have someone come to you and be like man

2749
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:16,480
I just sent this dude money through

2750
01:46:13,719 --> 01:46:18,840
PayPal friends and family and like don't

2751
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,759
have anything to show for it it's like

2752
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:23,279
that's a a tough position to be in and I

2753
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:25,280
always you know say you know send me the

2754
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:28,479
screenshots I'll take care of you like

2755
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:30,880
sorry that happened but it is a just

2756
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:33,879
kind of the one of the evils of of

2757
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:36,079
Instagram these days and I try to to

2758
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:38,520
post about you know anytime I see one

2759
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:41,359
and it's weird now with like the invite

2760
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:43,960
collaborator post on Instagram I'll

2761
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:45,839
invite my three other accounts I've got

2762
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:47,840
four accounts and I'll invite them all

2763
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:50,840
so that people can see these are like

2764
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:53,159
the accounts and even still within those

2765
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:55,079
the scammers will comment and for some

2766
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:57,079
reason a lot of times I don't see them

2767
01:46:55,079 --> 01:46:59,920
whether I only have them blocked on one

2768
01:46:57,079 --> 01:47:02,039
of the the four accounts or whatever so

2769
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,520
they fly under my radar and people be

2770
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:05,439
like responding even recently somebody

2771
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:08,080
was

2772
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:10,039
like chem dog was commenting to somebody

2773
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:12,000
about like dude that's a fake account

2774
01:47:10,039 --> 01:47:14,000
and he got his first fake account after

2775
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,880
our collab together where they were like

2776
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,920
pretending to be chem dog glass he was

2777
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:19,400
like man this is like this is new I've

2778
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:21,560
never experienced this before so you

2779
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:23,759
must be doing something right but yeah

2780
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:25,800
that uh that's tricky to deal with and

2781
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,840
tricky to navigate but I try to steer

2782
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:31,960
people right try to post fairly

2783
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:33,760
frequently the The Fakes as they pop up

2784
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:35,319
that's just that's one of the evils of

2785
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,159
of dealing with that

2786
01:47:35,319 --> 01:47:39,719
platform yeah totally totally it's uh I

2787
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:42,439
feel like it's actually becoming worse

2788
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:45,639
more recently but hey you named the

2789
01:47:42,439 --> 01:47:48,198
magic word chem dog focal theme in the

2790
01:47:45,639 --> 01:47:52,159
uh the show overall and I'm sure a

2791
01:47:48,198 --> 01:47:54,919
strain a man a family of strains that

2792
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:56,479
near and dear to both of our hearts tell

2793
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:57,639

2794
01:47:56,479 --> 01:47:59,118
people are excited a few of the

2795
01:47:57,639 --> 01:48:01,960
listeners were like definitely ask about

2796
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:04,759
the chem dog collab and uh tell us a

2797

2798
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:10,719
man that uh that was special to me that

2799
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:13,599
dude I have so much respect and love for

2800
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:15,439
him and really really that was something

2801
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:18,920
special for me it was a project I've

2802
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:21,759
been working on since 2018 or 2019

2803
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:24,319
somewhere in there um I met him first in

2804
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:27,239
like 2015 I think I commissioned a

2805
01:48:24,319 --> 01:48:29,759
little one from him and then a hammer

2806
01:48:27,238 --> 01:48:32,039
and some other stuff and you know it

2807
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:36,599
just it was amazing the first time I met

2808
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:39,198
him um James Bean introduced him to me

2809
01:48:36,599 --> 01:48:40,960
using my real name rather than Dez and

2810
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:42,638
every time I'd see him after that he'd

2811
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:45,239
be like hey and say my real name and it

2812
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:47,880
was like so special to me that this

2813
01:48:45,238 --> 01:48:50,399
person cam [ __ ] chem dog dude like

2814
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:53,359
knows my real name enough so to remember

2815
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:55,598
it year after year like it was just it

2816
01:48:53,359 --> 01:48:58,359
was crazy to me and he like I don't know

2817
01:48:55,599 --> 01:49:00,239
his whole story was very touching to me

2818
01:48:58,359 --> 01:49:02,679
the fact that he's like a standup dude

2819
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:04,959
and and you know did the right thing and

2820
01:49:02,679 --> 01:49:05,960
you know there's it's just I said

2821
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,439
there's a difference because we're

2822
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:09,679
different that's always been kind of my

2823
01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:11,319
my catchphrase with with night owl and

2824
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:13,960
what I do and I feel like he's like that

2825
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:16,519
as well I saw a lot

2826
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:20,000
of similarities as far as you know

2827
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:22,400
starting young and and trying to um be a

2828
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,800
good Steward for the plant and to keep

2829
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:28,679
things alive and moving and knowing when

2830
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:30,840

2832
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:36,599
dude and so I made the I worked the line

2833
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:38,119

2834
01:49:36,599 --> 01:49:39,920
like dude we should like collab on this

2835
01:49:38,118 --> 01:49:41,960
I'd love to like collab on this let's

2836
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,639
let's do this but just the timing never

2837
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:46,800
worked out andd be like yeah like well

2838
01:49:43,639 --> 01:49:49,199
let's do it let's do it like he he never

2839
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:51,000
[ __ ] on the idea he was NE always

2840
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:53,319
positive about it never had a bad thing

2841
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,479
to say always excited about it but just

2842
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:58,079
the timing never worked out then you

2843
01:49:55,479 --> 01:50:00,399
know he got a job in the legal industry

2844
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:01,960
has a grow out in Massachusetts for a

2845
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:04,559
dispensary out there and that really

2846
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:06,719
started to take up a lot of his time so

2847
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,440
the seeds were ready well over a year

2848
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:10,239
ago and finally I hit him up again I was

2849
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:12,319
like man I'd so love to do that that

2850
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:14,359
collab thing and the whole time I was

2851
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:17,118
like I want to I want to do something

2852
01:50:14,359 --> 01:50:19,719
special for it I want it to like be a

2853
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:23,079
historic thing you know at least in the

2854
01:50:19,719 --> 01:50:26,880
can world like this was [ __ ] chemdog

2855
01:50:23,079 --> 01:50:31,519
again like this is the man you know so

2856
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:34,760
in 2019 I think it was I saw his collab

2857
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:38,199
with swamp seeds actually see I have

2858
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:40,639
them right here in front of me he did uh

2859
01:50:38,198 --> 01:50:43,319
the dog ways collab with Swamp Boy seeds

2860
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:45,359
and they did bals that the seeds came in

2861
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:47,399
numbered from one to 100 I've that

2862
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,158
number 41 out of 100 right here in front

2863
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:50,319
of me and it was like I don't even want

2864
01:50:49,158 --> 01:50:52,198
to open them I don't want to break the

2865
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:55,679
seal on these because it's such like a a

2866
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:57,759
special cool sentimental pack and so I

2867
01:50:55,679 --> 01:51:00,039
always had the idea I loved his ones

2868
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:02,280
they've always been like my go-to piece

2869
01:51:00,039 --> 01:51:05,840
ever since I started smoking chillums

2870
01:51:02,279 --> 01:51:07,960
and little ones were always my go-to um

2871
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:11,880
so I wanted to to

2872
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:13,520
do numbered ones for a collab drop like

2873
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,520
that would be so [ __ ] dope to have

2874
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:16,079
some night

2875
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:19,639
L

2876
01:51:16,078 --> 01:51:21,840
ones and I'm not like I I never knew the

2877
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:23,599
business side of glass I never knew just

2878
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,239
how incredibly expensive it is to have

2879
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:29,039
custom Millies made and I mean it was

2880
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:31,479
like mindblowing the amount of money I

2881
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:33,319
spent on these things and I I charged

2882
01:51:31,479 --> 01:51:35,279
five dollar more than I actually paid

2883
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:37,279
for them to be made which didn't even

2884
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:39,639
cover the the credit card processing fee

2885
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:41,800
for the actual pipe it was like it was

2886
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:44,440
definitely like a a labor of love type

2887
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:46,199
thing but man I am so honored and so

2888
01:51:44,439 --> 01:51:48,719
proud and so stoked that we got these

2889
01:51:46,198 --> 01:51:51,519
one's done with the night owl Millies

2890
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:53,760
there's two UV reactive Millies in it

2891
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:55,920
and one regular night Al Millie and then

2892
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,719
the chem dog Millie and they're just

2893
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,078
[ __ ] gorgeous man every single one

2894
01:51:57,719 --> 01:52:02,800
that I sent out I didn't want to I was

2895
01:52:00,078 --> 01:52:05,158
like I wanted to keep all 100 for myself

2896
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:07,599
like they're all so beautiful and each

2897
01:52:05,158 --> 01:52:09,839
time I see one posted I remember packing

2898
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:11,520
it up and like the specific details of

2899
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,639
that individual one that really stood

2900
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:15,079
out to me so any time I see one posted

2901
01:52:13,639 --> 01:52:16,719
I'm like this one was one of my

2902
01:52:15,078 --> 01:52:18,078
favorites because of this or this one

2903
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:21,118
was one of my favorites because of this

2904
01:52:18,078 --> 01:52:23,519
feature but yeah that was like years and

2905
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:25,238
years in the making and to have it all

2906
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:28,560
finally come to fruition the way that it

2907
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:30,839
did was just phenomenal and again not to

2908
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:34,599
speak out of school but it was at a time

2909
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:36,880
um in cam dog's life where his father

2910
01:52:34,599 --> 01:52:40,039
was sick and rest in peace his father

2911
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:43,199
did just pass away recently but I think

2912
01:52:40,039 --> 01:52:45,960
it also really helped kind of with some

2913
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:48,399
stuff that he had going on too um

2914
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,158
financially so it was such an honor for

2915
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:51,559
me to be able to pay back something to

2916
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:52,960
this man who's given so much to the

2917
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:57,440
Cannabis community

2918
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:59,399
and I also released some chem 91 R Autos

2919
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:00,678
which nobody really releases reg autos

2920
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:02,719
because I feel like oh that's giving

2921
01:53:00,679 --> 01:53:04,399
away intellectual property or you know

2922
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:06,639
you're GNA spawn a hundred different

2923
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:08,879
companies that are all making seeds from

2924
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:11,719
these Auto Rags which it did spawn some

2925
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,599
but so be it I wanted that out there the

2926
01:53:11,719 --> 01:53:15,920
way the chm91 made an impact on the

2927
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,960
photo period side of things I wanted

2928
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,599
these othero RS to make that same impact

2929
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:22,039
in these same waves on the Autoflower

2930
01:53:20,599 --> 01:53:25,719
side of things and I think it did

2931
01:53:22,039 --> 01:53:26,880
exactly that um so yeah it was like a

2932
01:53:25,719 --> 01:53:30,679
just an

2933
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:33,319
amazing an amazing thing and to me a m

2934
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:36,000
stone and a historic uh piece of

2935
01:53:33,319 --> 01:53:37,599
cannabis history here and truly an honor

2936
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,078
to be able to work with this man who

2937
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:43,199
I've looked up to for so long in doing

2938
01:53:40,078 --> 01:53:46,158
this thing so and and man nothing but

2939
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:49,359
but love and respect to that dude I

2940
01:53:46,158 --> 01:53:50,960
think I think he may be getting into the

2941
01:53:49,359 --> 01:53:52,799
I I know he's been been making some

2942
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,520
seeds and testing some seeds out of his

2943
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:57,039
own soon so hopefully we see some chem

2944
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:59,320
dog releases soon and I told him you

2945
01:53:57,039 --> 01:54:01,198
know any any help he need with that he

2946
01:53:59,319 --> 01:54:03,000
he reached out to me to ask about like

2947
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:05,279
you know packaging and stickers and that

2948
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,520
sort of thing but he told me he'd never

2949
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:09,078
been a part of any genetic drop like the

2950
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,840
one that we did he was like that was so

2951
01:54:09,078 --> 01:54:14,399
special and so unique and I mean they

2952
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:17,159
sold out within minutes like it was

2953
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:18,479
they're they're gone now all the on I I

2954
01:54:17,158 --> 01:54:20,279
we didn't even know how the ones would

2955
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:22,879
sell I was like is this too much to

2956
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:25,158
charge for a pipe if I just charged

2957
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:27,599
exactly or $5 more than what I paid for

2958
01:54:25,158 --> 01:54:30,078
them like is that going to be too much

2959
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:32,440
because it ended up being 225 bucks for

2960
01:54:30,078 --> 01:54:35,198
the the pipes ended up costing me like

2961
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:37,198
220 with the I did like some custom

2962
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:41,158
packaging some really really nice boxes

2963
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:43,039
for them we did some pins a keychain all

2964
01:54:41,158 --> 01:54:44,679
sorts of stickers and just extra goodies

2965
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:47,118
to go along with it and make it really

2966
01:54:44,679 --> 01:54:50,679
memorable and special

2967
01:54:47,118 --> 01:54:52,439
and yeah it it worked out phenomenally I

2968
01:54:50,679 --> 01:54:55,359
I thought initially maybe we'd saw like

2969
01:54:52,439 --> 01:54:59,439
25 even though I'd commissioned a 100

2970
01:54:55,359 --> 01:55:00,679
total and um yeah he made 40 the first

2971
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:02,118
batch and I was like that should be

2972
01:55:00,679 --> 01:55:04,880
plenty I don't think we're GNA sell 40

2973
01:55:02,118 --> 01:55:07,399
of them but yeah they sold out almost

2974
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,440
instantly and so he's like well [ __ ] I

2975
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:09,960
guess I have to go back and make the

2976
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:11,399
rest of them now so it was like another

2977
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:13,719
week he made another 40 and then the

2978
01:55:11,399 --> 01:55:15,118
next week he made the final 20 and yeah

2979
01:55:13,719 --> 01:55:16,118
it was like people were kind of pissed

2980
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:18,279
that they had to wait for it I was like

2981
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:20,719
I'm sorry I just I didn't expect this to

2982
01:55:18,279 --> 01:55:22,639
blow up like it did like I knew in my

2983
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:24,319
heart how huge this was but I didn't

2984
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:26,760
know other people would respond to it

2985
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:30,078
the same way that I was feeling about it

2986
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:31,960
and to see that I think it really was

2987
01:55:30,078 --> 01:55:34,399
heartwarming to him as much as it was to

2988
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:37,039
me to like get out there to a completely

2989
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:40,279
new audience and like really keep the

2990
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:43,158
The Legend of this beautiful person

2991
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:46,198
alive and this beautiful strain and and

2992
01:55:43,158 --> 01:55:48,519
yeah man I I I I am so stoked and

2993
01:55:46,198 --> 01:55:51,118
honored to have done that to have done

2994
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:53,280
it justice I think I did that really

2995
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:55,359
truly proper

2996
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:57,519
that's so epic to hear and you know I

2997
01:55:55,359 --> 01:56:00,839
Echo all those sentiments you know Greg

2998
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:02,480
and uh just I think he's wife as well

2999
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:05,119
you know they do so much for the scene

3000
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:06,678
and uh very very much unsung heroes and

3001
01:56:05,118 --> 01:56:08,000
that's so exciting to hear that there

3002
01:56:06,679 --> 01:56:09,639
might be some seeds from him on the

3003
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,279
horizon and that you were able to do

3004
01:56:09,639 --> 01:56:14,039
this really fulfilling and cool project

3005
01:56:12,279 --> 01:56:17,279
with him in in amongst that you

3006
01:56:14,039 --> 01:56:20,639
referenced uh dropping the uh the photo

3007
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:23,238
period Auto hybrids with the chem 91 I I

3008
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:25,239
wanted to ask about that because

3009
01:56:23,238 --> 01:56:26,839
I mean I guess you sort of answered it

3010
01:56:25,238 --> 01:56:28,000
but I'd love to get a bit more thoughts

3011
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:30,440
about do you think the fact that there

3012
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,960
are so few auto companies on the market

3013
01:56:30,439 --> 01:56:35,198
relatively speaking is a reflection of

3014
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:38,078
the fact that people are a bit guarded

3015
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:41,519
about releasing the regular stock as it

3016
01:56:38,078 --> 01:56:45,319
is kind of Ip and and I guess as an

3017
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:47,679
extrapolation of that do you think that

3018
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:49,319
you know like it's okay to give it out

3019
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:51,000
because the real skills sort of in the

3020
01:56:49,319 --> 01:56:52,639
breeding anyway it's not just in the

3021
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,198
base stock or what's your thoughts

3022
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:55,199
overall on

3023
01:56:55,399 --> 01:57:00,799
it I think that I'm afraid to see after

3024
01:56:59,399 --> 01:57:02,839
all the work that I've put in the

3025
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,560
Autoflower Jee pool get bottlenecked

3026
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:06,279
from people you know reversing the same

3027
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:07,880
[ __ ] onto the same [ __ ] over and over

3028
01:57:06,279 --> 01:57:10,679
again especially with all the bul stuff

3029
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:14,480
going on right now and the fake name

3030
01:57:10,679 --> 01:57:17,000
game the renaming stuff um I've released

3031
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:19,158
the Wizards Apprentice as Auto rigs I've

3032
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
released the Zod Delica Express as Auto

3033
01:57:19,158 --> 01:57:23,638
rigs I've released the blue microverse

3034
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:28,359
as Auto rigs I've done

3035
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:31,279
a um a few more I've done Zod Delica

3036
01:57:28,359 --> 01:57:33,839
Marathon Auto rig Z Del of Tyrone stomer

3037
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:35,399
Auto rig so I've tried to put a platform

3038
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,679
out there for other people that really

3039
01:57:35,399 --> 01:57:39,000
want to do the work and do it properly

3040
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:40,520
I've tried to give them the absolute

3041
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,800
best splitting possible and the

3042
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:45,000
foundation to move forward in the best

3043
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:47,039
light so that was really kind of like an

3044
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,439
altruistic type thing of like I want

3045
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:52,359
this to be carried on and who know who

3046
01:57:50,439 --> 01:57:54,000
knows how long any of us have on this

3047
01:57:52,359 --> 01:57:55,598
you know what I mean and if this stuff

3048
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,840
isn't out there if it's locked and

3049
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:59,199
guarded like if I pass away what's going

3050
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:02,599
to happen to my seed stock you know what

3051
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:04,598
I mean like it's I've got so much here

3052
01:58:02,599 --> 01:58:06,440
if I don't get it out and don't allow

3053
01:58:04,599 --> 01:58:08,639
others to work with it what good is it

3054
01:58:06,439 --> 01:58:11,399
you know so that's kind of that was kind

3055
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:14,039
of the motivation for it um and also

3056
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:15,799
just people were gatekeeping autos for a

3057
01:58:14,039 --> 01:58:17,880
long long time and weren't putting out

3058
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:21,079
Auto RS and even still there's like no

3059
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:22,840
Auto RS out there so and honestly

3060
01:58:21,078 --> 01:58:24,279
there's really not a market for for they

3061
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,480
they they most people that get Autos

3062
01:58:24,279 --> 01:58:28,279
want to grow them don't want to breed

3063
01:58:25,479 --> 01:58:31,039
them and I think

3064
01:58:28,279 --> 01:58:34,880
uh they're harder to breed they they

3065
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:38,198
take longer it's a a very dedicated and

3066
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,639
time space and energy consuming process

3067
01:58:38,198 --> 01:58:41,719
but to put these out there for the

3068
01:58:39,639 --> 01:58:43,920
people that actually want to do it right

3069
01:58:41,719 --> 01:58:45,000
felt like the right move to me and you

3070
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,679
know a lot of people told me I'm

3071
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,920
shooting myself in the foot by doing

3072
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:50,960
that you know this that and the other

3073
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:55,359
thing but at the end of the day it's

3074
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:56,599
also pallet driven and you know there's

3075
01:58:55,359 --> 01:58:58,960
I'm super

3076
01:58:56,599 --> 01:59:01,520
fortunate that somehow I've I've gained

3077
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:04,279
a very loyal following

3078
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:06,760
and again I'm not a person that like

3079
01:59:04,279 --> 01:59:09,238
shots my own horn or have ever been good

3080
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:10,840
about talking about myself other people

3081
01:59:09,238 --> 01:59:12,799
talk way better about me than I can ever

3082
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:15,679
talk about myself and that's just the

3083
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:18,599
way it's always been but the fact that

3084
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:21,639
people are loyal and do want that want

3085
01:59:18,599 --> 01:59:25,480
to work it their own ways is like it's

3086
01:59:21,639 --> 01:59:28,440
an honor to me um like it's just a a

3087
01:59:25,479 --> 01:59:29,879
weird thing where it's like I don't know

3088
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:31,598
sometimes I feel really good about what

3089
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:34,199
I've done and sometimes I'm like did I

3090
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:36,199
just like completely [ __ ] up myself from

3091
01:59:34,198 --> 01:59:38,198
a business standpoint but at the end of

3092
01:59:36,198 --> 01:59:40,198
the day I can't worry about it and

3093
01:59:38,198 --> 01:59:43,279
there's like I said there's so many new

3094
01:59:40,198 --> 01:59:44,559
projects to to constantly work on that

3095
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:46,238
it's hard for me to even do the

3096
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,719
reproduction so to put this stuff out

3097
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:50,078
there for other people to do just so it

3098
01:59:47,719 --> 01:59:52,920
carries on one way or the other in some

3099
01:59:50,078 --> 01:59:56,238
format is better than it not being a

3100
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:58,319
available totally totally because you

3101
01:59:56,238 --> 02:00:00,759
know we hear this sentiment shared in

3102
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:03,158
the context of clones all the time it's

3103
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,840
like it's all well and good to to sit on

3104
02:00:03,158 --> 02:00:07,078
it but if something happens to you it's

3105
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:09,039
just it's gone and then you know it's

3106
02:00:07,078 --> 02:00:11,319
it's almost better to just give it out

3107
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:13,359
there just for the purposes of keeping

3108
02:00:11,319 --> 02:00:15,599
it but then as you said there's also

3109
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:17,920
just a lot of good intention and a a

3110
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:19,520
sense of collegiality in sharing it and

3111
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,760
saying you know I'm not looking to

3112
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:24,199
hamstring anyone who wants to give it a

3113
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:26,520
go themselves so that's really awesome I

3114
02:00:24,198 --> 02:00:29,439
love that answer that's that's beautiful

3115
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:31,760
I wanted to ask you you know you you

3116
02:00:29,439 --> 02:00:33,919
spoke about how you let your work and

3117
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:35,760
let others speak about you more than

3118
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,239
yourself and I think looking at the

3119
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:39,599
sheer number of collaborations you've

3120
02:00:37,238 --> 02:00:41,718
had all just you know sort of really big

3121
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:44,520
hitter names in the mix there is there

3122
02:00:41,719 --> 02:00:46,639
anything fun on the horizon you might

3123
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:48,800
want to give people a sneak peek into or

3124
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:51,159
even just more generally any strains on

3125
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,679
the horizon you are sort of locked into

3126
02:00:51,158 --> 02:00:56,839
working with that might slip

3127
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:59,399
out um as far as stuff that I want to

3128
02:00:56,840 --> 02:01:02,800
share I've pretty much said most of it

3129
02:00:59,399 --> 02:01:06,960
the piff um the banana OG obviously the

3130
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:10,520
blue Power um the AJ Sour Diesel um I'm

3131
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:12,118
working with top dog to do a starg auto

3132
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:14,800
um I've kind of [ __ ] that up and lost

3133
02:01:12,118 --> 02:01:18,759
the Clone got it back from him lost it

3134
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:20,560
again um got it back from him lost it

3135
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:23,360
again bought it from somebody else lost

3136
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:26,000
it again so I really have like [ __ ]

3137
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:28,598
that one up royally and I feel so much

3138
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,960
Shame about that but you know life

3139
02:01:28,599 --> 02:01:33,000
happens and I'll I'll I'll get it back

3140
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:35,840
again I'll make it right we'll do it do

3141
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,078
it the Justice it deserves

3142
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:42,360
um but yeah those are are pretty much

3143
02:01:39,078 --> 02:01:44,639
the ones as of now that that I want to

3144
02:01:42,359 --> 02:01:48,238
share and keep the rest Under Wraps I've

3145
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:50,319
found that if I give too much away or if

3146
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:51,559
I'm say I'm working on a certain stream

3147
02:01:50,319 --> 02:01:53,799
all of a sudden another breeder will

3148
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,679
have on the market six months later

3149
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:57,560
which you know unless they happen to

3150
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:59,880
have that same mindset we're doing the

3151
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,960
work which these people that all of a

3152
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:04,279
sudden come out are the name game people

3153
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:06,480
that just will slap whatever name sells

3154
02:02:04,279 --> 02:02:08,078
on something that it's like I just keep

3155
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:10,519
it to myself at this point until I'm

3156
02:02:08,078 --> 02:02:11,559
like almost ready to release it so yeah

3157
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:14,800
those are the ones that I'm I'm

3158
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:17,360
comfortable kind of talking about now no

3159
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:20,119
look I think you mentioned just a a

3160
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:22,719
variety of strains there which is just a

3161
02:02:20,118 --> 02:02:24,479
plethora to get excited about no need to

3162
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:26,158
feel bad about not dropping anymore

3163
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:28,959
there was about four or five hitters in

3164
02:02:26,158 --> 02:02:30,399
there uh I want to ask a few of the fans

3165
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:32,399
submitted questions we got from the

3166
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:36,559
patreon but before I do a few last ones

3167
02:02:32,399 --> 02:02:38,719
from me which was uh just as a sort of

3168
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,800
general question not not that I'm like

3169
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:43,279
you know thinking of any project is

3170
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:45,400
there one project of yours that you

3171
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:47,519
think to yourself you know what I wish I

3172
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:48,960
could go back to that one either because

3173
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:50,440
it's just so good you want to continue

3174
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,960
it or because maybe you think you might

3175
02:02:50,439 --> 02:02:54,799
have been able to do it better does

3176
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:59,279
anything jump to mind when I say

3177
02:02:54,800 --> 02:03:01,520
that I think the Tyrone stomper at F7

3178
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:07,039
started to get a

3179
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:10,239
little the bud structure became looser

3180
02:03:07,039 --> 02:03:11,840
and isn't quite what it was before so

3181
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:13,519
that is one that I would like to go back

3182
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:16,000
to it still

3183
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:18,079
hybridizes incredible it still crosses

3184
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,359
out beautifully all the the hybrids from

3185
02:03:18,078 --> 02:03:23,000
it are amazing but in its pure form I

3186
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:25,198
think I lost something just in the

3187
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,279
structure alone but also at the same

3188
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:29,960
time it's frostier now than it's ever

3189
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:32,519
been I mean the main stock has tricomes

3190
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,359
on it like the the the fan leaves

3191
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:36,320
everything is just completely it looks

3192
02:03:34,359 --> 02:03:38,598
insane like it's some sort of mutation

3193
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:41,078
happened to where the bud structure lost

3194
02:03:38,599 --> 02:03:43,199
its density a bit but it gained all

3195
02:03:41,078 --> 02:03:46,158
sorts of resin everywhere so it's like

3196
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:49,359
this crazy just little freak plant of

3197
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:51,839
pure resin that is amazing and like I

3198
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:53,479
said crosses out well still but that's

3199
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,319
one that I would like to to go back and

3200
02:03:53,479 --> 02:03:57,399
kind of lock back down on its own so

3201
02:03:55,319 --> 02:04:01,078
that it can be released you know nice

3202
02:03:57,399 --> 02:04:02,960
and pure again

3203
02:04:01,078 --> 02:04:04,799
um I

3204
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:06,599
think I mean that's the only one that

3205
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,480
I'm kind of hard on myself about to to

3206
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:09,960
be

3207
02:04:07,479 --> 02:04:12,158
honest well I I think that one's pretty

3208
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:14,800
fair to be honest I but you know it also

3209
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:16,638
sounds like it's it hasn't deteriorated

3210
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:18,039
it's just sort of diverged a bit from

3211
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:20,039
the original but it's got all those

3212
02:04:18,039 --> 02:04:21,960
tricomes so that's a good answer I like

3213
02:04:20,039 --> 02:04:23,479
that one I like that one as a bit of a

3214
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:26,039
tongue and cheek one I want to know will

3215
02:04:23,479 --> 02:04:29,000
we ever see any photo period from

3216
02:04:26,039 --> 02:04:32,760
you so it's funny you mentioned that I

3217
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,960
um I did do a release of early bird fast

3218
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:37,320
photos to go along with Night Owl so

3219
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,279
there's a um from seed to Stone that's

3220
02:04:37,319 --> 02:04:40,799
YouTube channel it's like massive he's

3221
02:04:39,279 --> 02:04:42,599
got a huge Discord and he did a

3222
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:45,199
strawberry milk and cookies remix grow

3223
02:04:42,599 --> 02:04:47,520
off recently and for his patreon members

3224
02:04:45,198 --> 02:04:49,719
I released for the first time ever just

3225
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:53,000
just gifted them out just to see them

3226
02:04:49,719 --> 02:04:56,319
grown out um across called Majestic tie

3227
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:59,158
which was an old thae clone cross to

3228
02:04:56,319 --> 02:05:01,960
wizards apprentice and that was like my

3229
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:04,399
first ever photo period cross that I had

3230
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:06,118
released or photo to Auto so the whole

3231
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:08,598
concept was like early bird fast

3232
02:05:06,118 --> 02:05:10,759
finishing photo periods to go along with

3233
02:05:08,599 --> 02:05:13,920
the Night Out Auto flowers and I mean

3234
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:15,719
I've got hundreds and hundreds of of

3235
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,599
photo period crosses that I've made over

3236
02:05:15,719 --> 02:05:19,719
the years just photo to photo straight

3237
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:21,840
up just for preservation sake and and

3238
02:05:19,719 --> 02:05:25,039
just for my own to dig into later here

3239
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:26,840
and see what I can find um but I do feel

3240
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:29,479
there's some Merit to staying in My Own

3241
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:31,159
Lane I do feel there's Merit to

3242
02:05:29,479 --> 02:05:33,439
remaining loyal to the people that have

3243
02:05:31,158 --> 02:05:35,399
remained loyal to me and at the end of

3244
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:37,799
the day there's just not enough space

3245
02:05:35,399 --> 02:05:39,279
and time for me to do both at least not

3246
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:42,360
to the level that I want to be doing

3247
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:43,960
them and so Autos are are my favorite

3248
02:05:42,359 --> 02:05:46,719
thing to grow I love how they keep me on

3249
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:48,359
my toes I love how they keep me involv

3250
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:51,319
um I've got if you couldn't tell from

3251
02:05:48,359 --> 02:05:53,759
the conversation so far some ADHD issues

3252
02:05:51,319 --> 02:05:55,799
so the autos and they constant changing

3253
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:58,000
and their speed and everything just just

3254
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:00,119
I don't know it it keeps my interest

3255
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
from start to finish so that's really

3256
02:06:00,118 --> 02:06:04,479
where my my heart my passion is at but I

3257
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,039
I wouldn't mind releasing some of the

3258
02:06:04,479 --> 02:06:07,959
photo period stuff that I've made just

3259
02:06:06,039 --> 02:06:10,359
to get it out there because again it's

3260
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:12,319
stuff like with this space dog clone

3261
02:06:10,359 --> 02:06:15,639
that's no longer in existence I crossed

3262
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:17,679
that to the blue mey X2 crossed it to

3263
02:06:15,639 --> 02:06:19,440
space dog seed stock which I went

3264
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:21,960
through a bunch of packs of the the

3265
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:24,198
space dog seed stock to find this same

3266
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:26,559
clone before the people that had the

3267
02:06:24,198 --> 02:06:28,359
Clone allowed me access to it and there

3268
02:06:26,559 --> 02:06:30,559
was nothing like this clone in the seed

3269
02:06:28,359 --> 02:06:32,719
stock and come to find out later I guess

3270
02:06:30,559 --> 02:06:34,760
there was a mixup with with sub cool at

3271
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:36,359
one point in his males where you know

3272
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:38,239
the space dude wasn't the space dude

3273
02:06:36,359 --> 02:06:40,719
anymore and so the seeds that I had

3274
02:06:38,238 --> 02:06:42,399
weren't the same seed stock from

3275
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:45,239
previous even though they were you know

3276
02:06:42,399 --> 02:06:47,598
labeled and sold as such and so there's

3277
02:06:45,238 --> 02:06:51,879
there's stuff like that that even the

3278
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:55,599
the grap stomper OG um some aloha White

3279
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:57,400
Widow stuff that I like I cross to flumo

3280
02:06:55,599 --> 02:07:00,119
and the space dog seed stock and a bunch

3281
02:06:57,399 --> 02:07:02,719
of stuff and yeah I'd love to get it out

3282
02:07:00,118 --> 02:07:06,319
there at this point a lot of it's older

3283
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:08,639
maybe you know eight to 10 years old um

3284
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:10,679
but I've made more recent photo crosses

3285
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:13,359
too it's just I don't know man I don't

3286
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:15,000
want to step on anybody's toes nowadays

3287
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:17,679
you see more and more photo people

3288
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,639
coming into the auto world and it's like

3289
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:21,199
all right well if there is this

3290
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:22,639
crossover maybe I will and I do try to

3291
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:24,598
like

3292
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:26,559
people that I look up to and respect and

3293
02:07:24,599 --> 02:07:28,400
and and like I try to give them the

3294
02:07:26,559 --> 02:07:31,320
proper guidance to do it right as far as

3295
02:07:28,399 --> 02:07:32,638
you know stepping in and like the I was

3296
02:07:31,319 --> 02:07:34,719
talking to C City earlier I was like

3297
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:38,078
dude you've got an amazing Foundation

3298
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:39,800
now to like use this blue Power Auto

3299
02:07:38,078 --> 02:07:41,519
against all your other stuff and do your

3300
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:43,840
own Autoflower line he was like man I

3301
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,079
was thinking the same thing but kind of

3302
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:47,960
he has that same mentality of not

3303
02:07:46,078 --> 02:07:49,359
wanting to step on any toes and he's

3304
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:50,800
like I was G to ask you about that and

3305
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:52,519
ask for your guidance with some of this

3306
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,599
and I was like yeah love to to help in

3307
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:56,360
any way I can because I'm never going to

3308
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:58,480
have the time and space to do all that

3309
02:07:56,359 --> 02:08:00,479
anyway and this stuff is phenomenal and

3310
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:02,118
should be made into Autoflower format so

3311
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:06,158
I'd love to to help with that sort of

3312
02:08:02,118 --> 02:08:08,479
thing but as far as doing it who knows

3313
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:12,238
maybe one

3314
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:14,198
day you uh you should do it I uh I'd

3315
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:16,519
encourage you to but it's interesting

3316
02:08:14,198 --> 02:08:19,118
because you you sort of alluded to this

3317
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:22,000
point that I like which is that there is

3318
02:08:19,118 --> 02:08:24,558
sort of this interesting stigma of um um

3319
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,319
you know any anyone who photo breeds

3320
02:08:24,559 --> 02:08:27,920
they'll make an auto no one bats an I

3321
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:30,439
but to do it the other way it's a little

3322
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:32,800
bit more of a gap to jump isn't it so

3323
02:08:30,439 --> 02:08:34,319
that that is interesting now the final

3324
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:36,440
question for me before we jump into some

3325
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:37,840
of the patreon ones it's a doozy but

3326
02:08:36,439 --> 02:08:41,399
it's the one I wanted to know probably

3327
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:44,078
the most explain to me how do I convert

3328
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:47,519
my favorite photo period clone into an

3329
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:51,118
auto sure excuse

3330
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:53,360
me so you take your photo period clone

3331
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:57,399
and you get some Auto Rags or if you're

3332
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:58,519
proficient in reversing find auto female

3333
02:08:57,399 --> 02:09:01,279
that you

3334
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:04,199
like either way reverse the the photo

3335
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:08,479
onto the auto or the auto onto the photo

3336
02:09:04,198 --> 02:09:08,479
or again excuse

3337
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:14,159
me again for the the sour stomper I used

3338
02:09:11,479 --> 02:09:15,959
a photo period male onto a female

3339
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:17,960
feminized Autoflower so you can do it

3340
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:20,118
either way it doesn't matter it's all in

3341
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:23,198
in the selection once again but you get

3342
02:09:20,118 --> 02:09:25,639
that F1 generation of photo to Auto they

3343
02:09:23,198 --> 02:09:29,719
are all going to be 100% of the time

3344
02:09:25,639 --> 02:09:31,639
photo period you take those you find the

3345
02:09:29,719 --> 02:09:34,319
male and the female that have the traits

3346
02:09:31,639 --> 02:09:37,559
of the photo period you cross those

3347
02:09:34,319 --> 02:09:39,078
together then you get the F2 Generation

3348
02:09:37,559 --> 02:09:41,679
here's where you need to run the big

3349
02:09:39,078 --> 02:09:44,479
numbers so

3350
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:47,880
25% give or take of that F2 generation

3351
02:09:44,479 --> 02:09:49,598
will be autos and then obviously if it's

3352
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:51,719
a regular seed stock half are going to

3353
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:53,960
be male and half are going to be female

3354
02:09:51,719 --> 02:09:56,960
so you run enough that you'll have a

3355
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:59,359
good selection of that 25% of Autos to

3356
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,198
pick out an auto mail with the photo

3357
02:09:59,359 --> 02:10:02,880
period Trace that you're looking for and

3358
02:10:01,198 --> 02:10:04,638
an auto female with the photo period

3359
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:08,118
Trace that you're looking for and you

3360
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:09,599
cross those two autos for fully auto F3

3361
02:10:08,118 --> 02:10:11,679
and then from there it's a matter of

3362
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:13,119
whether you want to refine the line more

3363
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:15,639
whether you want to feminize at that

3364
02:10:13,118 --> 02:10:17,679
point whatever you want to do um the

3365
02:10:15,639 --> 02:10:20,920
other way and I've just just started to

3366
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:23,118
dabble in this way of doing it is trying

3367
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:25,920
to work work the entire project

3368
02:10:23,118 --> 02:10:28,279
feminized so that it's that much easier

3369
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:30,319
so that you don't have to do you know a

3370
02:10:28,279 --> 02:10:32,198
multiple male selection at any given

3371
02:10:30,319 --> 02:10:33,519
stage at any generation where you don't

3372
02:10:32,198 --> 02:10:36,158
necessarily know what the male is going

3373
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:38,440
to provide doing it all a feminized

3374
02:10:36,158 --> 02:10:41,519
stock and potentially I haven't done

3375
02:10:38,439 --> 02:10:45,078
this yet but this is my next

3376
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:48,040
trial trial and error thing to do is

3377
02:10:45,078 --> 02:10:50,439
making F1 feminized photo to Autos

3378
02:10:48,039 --> 02:10:53,238
growing those out picking the single

3379
02:10:50,439 --> 02:10:56,439
best female those that resembles that

3380
02:10:53,238 --> 02:10:59,678
clone only selfing that one for the F2

3381
02:10:56,439 --> 02:11:02,839
Generation to try to lock in those photo

3382
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:05,960
traits and then in the F2 Generation

3383
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:08,520
picking out the the one or two best

3384
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:10,359
female autos and and sing or

3385
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:13,679
cross-pollinating those and just doing

3386
02:11:10,359 --> 02:11:15,078
the whole project feminized so that way

3387
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,920
it takes a lot of the guess work out of

3388
02:11:15,078 --> 02:11:19,840
it now again I haven't done this yet but

3389
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:22,239
I have set myself up to do this now with

3390
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:24,119
some new feminized photo to Auto crosses

3391
02:11:22,238 --> 02:11:26,879
that I'm looking forward to

3392
02:11:24,118 --> 02:11:29,279
trying that's that's brilliant and very

3393
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:31,840
comprehensive I I was sort of in my mind

3394
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:33,920
following each step and uh it sounds

3395
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:36,840
like as you said a lot more involved

3396
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:38,239
than regular breeding but very doable um

3397
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:41,199
just probably takes a lot of time

3398
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:43,399
patience and skill I guess my question

3399
02:11:41,198 --> 02:11:46,158
then is on that last step right where

3400
02:11:43,399 --> 02:11:48,158
you say you've got the F3 and most of

3401
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:51,078
the time people release feminized

3402
02:11:48,158 --> 02:11:53,078
Autoflower seeds so I'm guessing you pop

3403
02:11:51,078 --> 02:11:55,078
those seeds and you pick one of the

3404
02:11:53,078 --> 02:11:58,238
females and you reverse it onto the

3405
02:11:55,078 --> 02:12:01,198
others and that's the stock is there any

3406
02:11:58,238 --> 02:12:03,039
way of which you can improve your select

3407
02:12:01,198 --> 02:12:04,439
cuz I'm assuming in an ideal world

3408
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:07,319
you're going to reverse one of the

3409
02:12:04,439 --> 02:12:08,598
better females but you know you don't

3410
02:12:07,319 --> 02:12:10,039
it's not like a photo period where you

3411
02:12:08,599 --> 02:12:12,520
get to know which ones are the better

3412
02:12:10,039 --> 02:12:14,039
ones so is it just like you know the

3413
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:17,040
good the good female would be the pollen

3414
02:12:14,039 --> 02:12:19,399
donor if it's not the pollen provider or

3415
02:12:17,039 --> 02:12:20,800
pollen recipient or is there any is

3416
02:12:19,399 --> 02:12:21,799
there any difference in that situation

3417
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:23,960
of you

3418
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:25,559
found and this is where photo period

3419
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:27,960
readers have it so easy because they

3420
02:12:25,559 --> 02:12:30,159
could keep clones and I I don't want to

3421
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:31,760
like again I don't want to Che my own

3422
02:12:30,158 --> 02:12:34,158
horn or anything but if I was to enter

3423
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:36,800
the photo period world I do think I

3424
02:12:34,158 --> 02:12:40,000
could run circles around some of the the

3425
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:41,599
current readers that are out there um

3426
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,559
and again you might want to cut that out

3427
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:47,199
I'm an [ __ ] for even thinking that

3428
02:12:43,559 --> 02:12:49,279
but anyway yeah no I always po I always

3429
02:12:47,198 --> 02:12:50,839
reverse way more plants than I need I

3430
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:53,519
always pollinate way more plants than I

3431
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:56,119
need and then it really comes down to

3432
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:58,840
after those are harvested smoking each

3433
02:12:56,118 --> 02:13:00,479
one and figuring out which seed stock

3434
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:02,480
from those to actually work with moving

3435
02:13:00,479 --> 02:13:04,078
forward so like I was saying some of the

3436
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:05,718
bulk guys will just mix them all

3437
02:13:04,078 --> 02:13:08,359
together and call it one individual

3438
02:13:05,719 --> 02:13:10,760
strain you know what I mean whereas I

3439
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:12,319
will only take one of those plants and

3440
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:14,760
move forward with that seed stock to the

3441
02:13:12,319 --> 02:13:16,158
Next Generation and you don't know until

3442
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:17,760
you actually smoke it because the

3443
02:13:16,158 --> 02:13:19,198
effects actually matter it's not just

3444
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,960
well this one's really pretty so we're

3445
02:13:19,198 --> 02:13:23,879
moving forward with this one there's

3446
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:26,000
there is it's way deeper than that so I

3447
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:29,078
always do way more I'm always tossing

3448
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,479
out way more plants and seeds and uh

3449
02:13:29,078 --> 02:13:33,238
I've got yeah seed stock that'll never

3450
02:13:31,479 --> 02:13:34,919
be released for that exact reason is it

3451
02:13:33,238 --> 02:13:36,678
just I made it thinking it was going to

3452
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:39,319
be one thing but it didn't live up to my

3453
02:13:36,679 --> 02:13:42,440
expectation so it's just it's it's a

3454
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:44,359
nonstarter at this point um but yeah the

3455
02:13:42,439 --> 02:13:45,598
the photo period guys definitely have a

3456
02:13:44,359 --> 02:13:49,198
nice benefit of being able to keep

3457
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:50,800
clones and going back and then yeah

3458
02:13:49,198 --> 02:13:52,558
working back to the same stock over and

3459
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:55,360
over

3460
02:13:52,559 --> 02:13:57,159
again yeah certainly I can appreciate

3461
02:13:55,359 --> 02:13:59,319
how that would be more challenging

3462
02:13:57,158 --> 02:14:01,479
definitely definitely my my final

3463
02:13:59,319 --> 02:14:04,238
question there does that mean that you

3464
02:14:01,479 --> 02:14:06,158
have to smoke like seeded flour cuz I

3465
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:09,198
always found like it's it's more

3466
02:14:06,158 --> 02:14:11,319
difficult for me um to sort of guess the

3467
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:12,919
winner um but I guess it's this fine

3468
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:14,679
balance of making seed and having some

3469
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:17,199
flour to smoke it's it's always

3470
02:14:14,679 --> 02:14:20,039
challenging how how do you combat that

3471
02:14:17,198 --> 02:14:23,039
one that's it yeah you just smoke the

3472
02:14:20,039 --> 02:14:24,719
flower recently got one of those I think

3473
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:26,599
they're called the pollinator over in

3474
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:29,559
like the EU and other places like the

3475
02:14:26,599 --> 02:14:32,000
tumbler where you can sift the the the

3476
02:14:29,559 --> 02:14:34,320
heads of the tricomes off without you

3477
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,399
know destroying obviously I can't blast

3478
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:39,279
seeded flow or whatever so I smoke it I

3479
02:14:37,399 --> 02:14:41,479
pick the seeds out and try to leave you

3480
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:43,719
know the actual flower intact as best as

3481
02:14:41,479 --> 02:14:45,479
possible without having to smoke seeds

3482
02:14:43,719 --> 02:14:47,559
um but yeah I'll do the KE as well I'll

3483
02:14:45,479 --> 02:14:48,879
smoke that but that's it yeah it's a

3484
02:14:47,559 --> 02:14:51,800
pain in the ass but that's the only way

3485
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:53,279
to do it there's no well I'm gonna smoke

3486
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:55,039
this other plant that's not pollinated

3487
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:56,519
and assume it's the same as the the seed

3488
02:14:55,039 --> 02:14:58,359
one you know what I mean like it's just

3489
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:00,520
I smoke seed flower and that's that's

3490
02:14:58,359 --> 02:15:03,839
kind of all there is to

3491
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:05,520
it thank you for falling on your sword

3492
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:08,000
uh for all of our

3493
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,679
benefit it's just such a funny idea like

3494
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,319
smoking seed and flour no one likes to

3495
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:13,760
do it but it's like in this case it's

3496
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:16,359
truly for the greater

3497
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:17,679
good uh okay so I mean the first of the

3498
02:15:16,359 --> 02:15:19,839
patreon questions we got some really

3499
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:22,158
good ones the first one from one of our

3500
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:24,639
supporters is wanted to know have you

3501
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:27,238
ever felt like or found what you felt

3502
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:29,199
was sort of the unique turpine that was

3503
02:15:27,238 --> 02:15:31,319
sort of brought or associated with the

3504
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:33,879
ruderalis gene at all or do you think

3505
02:15:31,319 --> 02:15:35,719
there aren't necessarily unique profiles

3506
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:39,118
associated with

3507
02:15:35,719 --> 02:15:40,520
it so I mentioned earlier that that my

3508
02:15:39,118 --> 02:15:42,000
older brother and some of his friends

3509
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:44,320
would say you know this tastes like an

3510
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,599
autof flow it tastes like an autof

3511
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:48,319
flow I've never had anyone be able to

3512
02:15:46,599 --> 02:15:51,078
describe what that tastes like to me and

3513
02:15:48,319 --> 02:15:53,279
I've never Associated any individual

3514
02:15:51,078 --> 02:15:55,279
flavor with an auto flour a lot of

3515
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:57,920
people even think and have thought for a

3516
02:15:55,279 --> 02:15:59,519
long time that all Autos taste the same

3517
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:01,960
and it just couldn't be further from the

3518
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:05,440
truth man there's like so many flavors

3519
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:09,960
out there now that yeah it's just it's

3520
02:16:05,439 --> 02:16:11,719
it's it's not a real thing um I've never

3521
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:15,760
actually had any pure

3522
02:16:11,719 --> 02:16:20,439
ruderalis um so I can't say whether I've

3523
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:23,000
like tasted a ruderalis turp before um

3524
02:16:20,439 --> 02:16:25,198
I've gotten and and online discussions

3525
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,238
with Todd McCormack who's like adamantly

3526
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:28,759
against autof flowers saying they suck

3527
02:16:27,238 --> 02:16:31,078
and they taste like [ __ ] and they don't

3528
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:32,960
get you high and I just try to as

3529
02:16:31,078 --> 02:16:35,760
diplomatically as possible explain to

3530
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:37,279
him that that's not the case anymore and

3531
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:38,719
tell them look I've got stuff I

3532
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:41,000
guarantee you I have flavors that you've

3533
02:16:38,718 --> 02:16:42,478
never had before and like I've sent them

3534
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:44,718
seeds before and I'm sure they just went

3535
02:16:42,478 --> 02:16:47,079
straight in the garbage but people like

3536
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:49,318
that like my greatest compliment is

3537
02:16:47,079 --> 02:16:51,159
photo period purists that are like damn

3538
02:16:49,318 --> 02:16:53,279
this is an auto flower that's like

3539
02:16:51,159 --> 02:16:55,920
that's the tops for me like when I can

3540
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:57,760
change somebody's mind through the work

3541
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:00,679
that excuse me through the work that

3542
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:03,280
I've done that's like that's the

3543
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:06,478
ultimate compliment for me um but as far

3544
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:08,880
as an actual Autoflower chirp I I I

3545
02:17:06,478 --> 02:17:10,840
can't say that I've ever had it speaking

3546
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:12,598
of Rutter Alis this is the hundred year

3547
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:14,920
anniversary of the discovery of ruter

3548
02:17:12,599 --> 02:17:17,519
Alis one of the people that grows my

3549
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:19,519
gear is actually related to the person

3550
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:21,880
that found it as an ancestor of the

3551
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:23,880
person that classified it and he reached

3552
02:17:21,879 --> 02:17:25,279
out to me I was like dude this is like I

3553
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:26,959
just wanted to let you know it's like

3554
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:29,439
100 years since this happened I was like

3555
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:32,398
oh my God that was like amazing so part

3556
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:34,120
of me wanted to reproduce like a lot of

3557
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:36,718
my old stuff and try to put out a

3558
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:39,120
hundred different varieties of through

3559
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:41,159
through the years of my catalog as like

3560
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:42,599
the hundredy year anniversary thing but

3561
02:17:41,159 --> 02:17:44,439
I realized that was way too far-fetched

3562
02:17:42,599 --> 02:17:46,639
with all the projects I had going on and

3563
02:17:44,439 --> 02:17:49,479
just would have been an insane thing to

3564
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:52,000
try to take on but yeah that's pretty a

3565
02:17:49,478 --> 02:17:54,239
pretty cool thing and I do I really want

3566
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,398
to to do an Autoflower documentary and

3567
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:59,638
go out and like interview you know joint

3568
02:17:56,398 --> 02:18:01,439
doctor and all Dutch Passion and misto

3569
02:17:59,638 --> 02:18:03,199
and all the people that have like helped

3570
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:07,280
to create this thing and make it to

3571
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:09,200
where it is today and that's kind of uh

3572
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:12,280
I haven't taken like a a break from

3573
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:13,519
doing this in a decade you know like you

3574
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:15,840
get in the garden and you're on the

3575
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:17,960
garden schedule and that's just kind of

3576
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,960
what it is so part of me really wants to

3577
02:18:17,959 --> 02:18:21,558
take a break and and dedicate some time

3578
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:22,799
and energy and doing that because I

3579
02:18:21,558 --> 02:18:24,478
think it would open a lot of people's

3580
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:25,879
eyes to kind of see how far they've come

3581
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:28,799
and see how much work has actually been

3582
02:18:25,879 --> 02:18:31,638
put into them but that's a pipe dream

3583
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:33,959
for now who knows I hope someone smarter

3584
02:18:31,638 --> 02:18:35,558
and and more well equipped than I takes

3585
02:18:33,959 --> 02:18:38,239
the lead on that and does it and I'd be

3586
02:18:35,558 --> 02:18:40,879
more than happy to to help out kind of

3587
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:42,239
give guidance as far as you know from my

3588
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:43,839
perspective who are the right people to

3589
02:18:42,239 --> 02:18:45,519
talk to and who have been doing it right

3590
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:47,679
but I think something like that would be

3591
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:50,398
really really cool to to

3592
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:51,920
see I love the idea of the documentary I

3593
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:53,079
mean every think you said was great but

3594
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:54,599
that you're right that sort of

3595
02:18:53,079 --> 02:18:56,398
documentary you can really see that

3596
02:18:54,599 --> 02:18:59,280
coming to life and being quite a

3597
02:18:56,398 --> 02:19:00,679
compelling story overall because you

3598
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:02,920
know there's really not that many

3599
02:19:00,679 --> 02:19:06,840
players in it right you can really trace

3600
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:08,840
it quite easily um and there are still

3601
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:11,159
alive right now and it's it's become

3602
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:12,920
such a like big thing where it's not

3603
02:19:11,159 --> 02:19:15,558
just for the longest time it was just

3604
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:17,519
Auto flowers or european junk and now

3605
02:19:15,558 --> 02:19:19,279
they're worldwide I mean some people say

3606
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:20,920
they're worldwide junk but they're

3607
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:22,719
really just I mean they're they're

3608
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:25,960
awesome they're out there they're

3609
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:27,839
amazing they've come so far like the

3610
02:19:25,959 --> 02:19:30,199
sheer amount of progress and evolution

3611
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:32,439
of these plants in the past decade is

3612
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:34,920
unlike anything else that I've ever ever

3613
02:19:32,439 --> 02:19:36,719
seen so I don't know I think there's

3614
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:39,079
potential to do something really really

3615
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:41,039
cool and really special with that maybe

3616
02:19:39,079 --> 02:19:42,879
now that I put it out there who knows

3617
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:44,359
maybe it'll come to fruition maybe I can

3618
02:19:42,879 --> 02:19:46,079
actually take some time off and figure

3619
02:19:44,359 --> 02:19:48,599
out how to do

3620
02:19:46,079 --> 02:19:51,398
it that would be cool that would be

3621
02:19:48,599 --> 02:19:52,799
really really cool uh the next question

3622
02:19:51,398 --> 02:19:53,959
we got from one of our listeners was

3623
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:56,239
they wanted to know if you'd ever

3624
02:19:53,959 --> 02:19:59,318
considered doing like some land race

3625
02:19:56,239 --> 02:20:01,039
style work using some of the land race

3626
02:19:59,318 --> 02:20:03,239
autof flowers out there and they just

3627
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:06,319
said oh you know like I don't know like

3628
02:20:03,239 --> 02:20:08,680
siberian By Thai or Siberian by Afghan

3629
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:10,600
or whatever it is um would you ever

3630
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:13,159
consider doing that sort of land race

3631
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:14,399
work or do you consider that like those

3632
02:20:13,159 --> 02:20:16,840
core building blocks are really

3633
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:18,639
necessary to make a highquality auto and

3634
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:20,840
you know what I mean you it take so long

3635
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:22,639
to go from scratch

3636
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:25,840
no I think that's really intriguing and

3637
02:20:22,639 --> 02:20:28,478
I know um I think there's a gentleman I

3638
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:30,559
think his name's like guardian of the

3639
02:20:28,478 --> 02:20:34,519
turps or something like that that has a

3640
02:20:30,559 --> 02:20:36,000
Siberian land race Auto flower and I

3641
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:37,239
think that would be really cool to see

3642
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:40,159
and I

3643
02:20:37,239 --> 02:20:42,559
think I mean there's just the land races

3644
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:46,280
is where it all began and I think

3645
02:20:42,559 --> 02:20:48,478
there's um a real there should be a real

3646
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:50,960
concerted effort made to preserve those

3647
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:54,000
to continue to keep those pure and work

3648
02:20:50,959 --> 02:20:58,000
with them and I'd love to to be a part

3649
02:20:54,000 --> 02:21:02,200
of it but I see myself doing it from

3650
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:04,200
Modern Autoflower stock as opposed to

3651
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:05,840
actually going back to a ruderalis stock

3652
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:08,319
because I feel like I'd be able to

3653
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:11,880
extract the best possible outcome using

3654
02:21:08,318 --> 02:21:14,760
stuff that I know and can breed away

3655
02:21:11,879 --> 02:21:17,239
from my Autoflower traits and select for

3656
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:19,680
the land race traes but keep the

3657
02:21:17,239 --> 02:21:22,159
Autoflower uh characteristic of actually

3658
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:24,200
flowering under 24 hours of light and

3659
02:21:22,159 --> 02:21:26,840
man I love the land R stuff like that

3660
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:28,319
that zal Delica Express is my favorite

3661
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:32,559
one of my favorite strains if not my

3662
02:21:28,318 --> 02:21:35,799
favorite strain of all time like I I I I

3663
02:21:32,559 --> 02:21:39,559
think I improved on the actual zelica

3664
02:21:35,799 --> 02:21:41,279
photo period for my taste I like the the

3665
02:21:39,559 --> 02:21:43,840
Autoflower version more than I like the

3666
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:46,280
photo period at this point and that's

3667
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:50,079
one that I'm going to work back again I

3668
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:52,280
recently got some um zelica was called

3669
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:54,799

out uh same for the Destroyer I feel

3675
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:06,200
like that's a strain that should be put

3676
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:08,760
in Autoflower format I'm really looking

3677
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:10,920
forward to I got some some seeds of that

3678
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:12,880
that you know just aren't around anymore

3679
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:16,359
so I'm looking forward to to doing that

3680
02:22:12,879 --> 02:22:19,039
one I'd love to also go back and do some

3681
02:22:16,359 --> 02:22:22,040
of the the Pakistani stuff and the

3682
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:23,359
Afghan stuff and really like you know

3683
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:25,720
lock those

3684
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:28,159
in but there's just there's so many

3685
02:22:25,719 --> 02:22:30,719
projects and so few of me and so few

3686
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:33,600
hours in in the day and I only I can

3687
02:22:30,719 --> 02:22:36,398
only do so much and I hope

3688
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:40,280
to give

3689
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:42,799
a provide the proper show the way to do

3690
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:44,079
it right you know what I mean like don't

3691
02:22:42,799 --> 02:22:46,599
have

3692
02:22:44,079 --> 02:22:48,079
asset just do it right you know do the

3693
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,520
proper

3694
02:22:48,079 --> 02:22:53,079
selections and and be in it for

3695
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:54,920
creating something new that you want to

3696
02:22:53,079 --> 02:22:58,520
see in the world that's that's better

3697
02:22:54,920 --> 02:23:00,960
than what it was before I feel like the

3698
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:03,040
other day I was like what what

3699
02:23:00,959 --> 02:23:05,559
businesses what things have gotten

3700
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:07,880
better over the past few years I feel

3701
02:23:05,559 --> 02:23:09,879
like almost everything surrounding us

3702
02:23:07,879 --> 02:23:12,199
has like been in Decline these past few

3703
02:23:09,879 --> 02:23:13,759
years and what I feel like Amazon is the

3704
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:15,720
only thing that's actually gotten better

3705
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:17,439
with time like all right I can get

3706
02:23:15,719 --> 02:23:19,239
anything I want shipped to me in two

3707
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:21,880
days now but other than that I feel like

3708
02:23:19,239 --> 02:23:24,000
everything else is gotten worse and

3709
02:23:21,879 --> 02:23:26,559
prices continue to go up and inflation

3710
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:29,000
keeps happening and it's to the point

3711
02:23:26,559 --> 02:23:31,318
where honestly I I I do think I'm going

3712
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:33,120
to have to raise my prices next year

3713
02:23:31,318 --> 02:23:35,359
just to continue to stay afloat with

3714
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:38,760
everything else is when I started

3715
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:42,399
selling seeds and 20 15 or whatever $50

3716
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:45,359
then is now $68 in today's market you

3717
02:23:42,398 --> 02:23:47,639
know and I'm not charging more per pack

3718
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:49,279
I'm still charging the same and

3719
02:23:47,639 --> 02:23:51,358
everything else has gotten way more

3720
02:23:49,279 --> 02:23:55,159
expensive so it's like

3721
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:56,640
it is kind of hard to to keep doing it

3722
02:23:55,159 --> 02:23:58,719
the way I've been doing it and stay

3723
02:23:56,639 --> 02:24:00,719
afloat sometimes but at the end of the

3724
02:23:58,719 --> 02:24:02,278
day I'd be doing it again whether the

3725
02:24:00,719 --> 02:24:03,799
money was involved or not and I'm G to

3726
02:24:02,279 --> 02:24:06,279
continue doing it and I think that

3727
02:24:03,799 --> 02:24:09,039
resonates with people and that shows in

3728
02:24:06,279 --> 02:24:11,439
their grows with my stuff and and so it

3729
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:13,080
is what it is whether whether I can make

3730
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:15,920
a living doing just this or whether I'm

3731
02:24:13,079 --> 02:24:17,359
gonna have to you know swing a hammer or

3732
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:19,439
figure out how to do electrical work

3733
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:21,840
like JJ man nothing but respect and love

3734
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:23,318
to that dude for even posting that you

3735
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:25,159
know what I mean that was like a really

3736
02:24:23,318 --> 02:24:27,840
[ __ ] badass thing for him to do and I

3737
02:24:25,159 --> 02:24:29,920
was like yeah this is like this is where

3738
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:32,079
we're at right now and again it goes

3739
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:35,760
back to the bul seed companies coming in

3740
02:24:32,079 --> 02:24:39,719
and just it's a it's a different Beast

3741
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:43,000
than it was 10 years ago so it's uh it's

3742
02:24:39,719 --> 02:24:44,639
trying at times um I know you know I

3743
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,318
have a lot of followers on Instagram so

3744
02:24:44,639 --> 02:24:49,119
people think I'm some huge company but

3745
02:24:46,318 --> 02:24:51,278
it's just me and it it's it's a lot of

3746
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:53,960
work a lot of deck dedication a lot of

3747
02:24:51,279 --> 02:24:57,159
Blood Sweat and Tears a lot of risks

3748
02:24:53,959 --> 02:24:59,358
taken and that's just I mean it's the

3749
02:24:57,159 --> 02:25:01,959
plant is special and it reverberates

3750
02:24:59,359 --> 02:25:05,040
with me and and I reverberate with it

3751
02:25:01,959 --> 02:25:06,119
and we we we have this this love and

3752
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:09,319
understanding for each other that's

3753
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:11,040
something I've only ever come close to

3754
02:25:09,318 --> 02:25:12,959
finding a dog you know what I mean like

3755
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:15,479
just like weird loyalty to each other

3756
02:25:12,959 --> 02:25:18,959
where we we we just find each other in

3757
02:25:15,478 --> 02:25:21,559
the dark so yeah it's

3758
02:25:18,959 --> 02:25:23,278
a I'm sorry I went on a tangent there I

3759
02:25:21,559 --> 02:25:25,278
don't even know what what the initial

3760
02:25:23,279 --> 02:25:27,040
question was anymore but yeah I love

3761
02:25:25,279 --> 02:25:29,600
this and and I'm stoked to be able to do

3762
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:31,479
it so I'm going to keep doing it totally

3763
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:34,200
totally I I was about to say that's

3764
02:25:31,478 --> 02:25:36,599
beautiful I think I agree I 100% agree

3765
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:38,840
with every sentiment and and again big

3766
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:41,600
love to JJ for putting that post out

3767
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:43,279
there as you said it's uh it's a bit of

3768
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:45,359
the sign of the times but it's also a

3769
02:25:43,279 --> 02:25:48,439
sign of you know his character and

3770
02:25:45,359 --> 02:25:50,840
strength and as I said I I myself have

3771
02:25:48,439 --> 02:25:53,040
always advocated that people have a day

3772
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:54,799
job and my reason for that beyond

3773
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:57,439
anything else is that I think it allows

3774
02:25:54,799 --> 02:26:00,079
you a bit of extra freedom to explore

3775
02:25:57,439 --> 02:26:02,398
the weird stuff in counter that maybe

3776
02:26:00,079 --> 02:26:03,920
doesn't yield as well or whatever but

3777
02:26:02,398 --> 02:26:05,439
it's getting to that point now where as

3778
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:07,719
you said you know it's just the times

3779
02:26:05,439 --> 02:26:09,960
are changing but look let's end the

3780
02:26:07,719 --> 02:26:12,159
patreon questions with a positive one uh

3781
02:26:09,959 --> 02:26:14,039
one that several people asked in one

3782
02:26:12,159 --> 02:26:16,039
form or another what would be your

3783
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:18,160
advice for someone who wants to start

3784
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:20,479
breeding autos and I guess the question

3785
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:22,520
would be you know the obvious answer is

3786
02:26:20,478 --> 02:26:23,920
get yourself a pack of Autos but I mean

3787
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:26,159
do you think that you need to have a

3788
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:28,398
photo period you want to work with first

3789
02:26:26,159 --> 02:26:30,119
do you think get a bunch of exposure to

3790
02:26:28,398 --> 02:26:31,719
different Autos first and then figure

3791
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:33,200
out what you want to do what would just

3792
02:26:31,719 --> 02:26:35,119
be some general advice for someone who

3793
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:37,560
wants into the get who wants to get into

3794
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:39,840
the world of autos and maybe braiding

3795
02:26:37,559 --> 02:26:42,359
them whatever way you want to do it

3796
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:44,520
there's a million ways to skin a cat I

3797
02:26:42,359 --> 02:26:47,559
started out with photo to Auto and kind

3798
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:49,319
of that was my path for it was like this

3799
02:26:47,559 --> 02:26:50,920
is what I want to to see something new

3800
02:26:49,318 --> 02:26:53,199
brought into the world that's never

3801
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:55,120
existed before is an amazing feeling

3802
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:57,120
it's an amazing feat especially when

3803
02:26:55,120 --> 02:27:00,359
it's like when you have high standards

3804
02:26:57,120 --> 02:27:03,520
for it and when you're I'm I'm

3805
02:27:00,359 --> 02:27:06,920
hypercritical of myself so I'm I'm

3806
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:09,560
always trying to outdo myself push the

3807
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:13,159
limits as much as I can and and make

3808
02:27:09,559 --> 02:27:15,318
things better I've done tons and tons of

3809
02:27:13,159 --> 02:27:17,920
Auto to Auto crosses I've done tons of

3810
02:27:15,318 --> 02:27:19,359
photo to autoc crosses there's no wrong

3811
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:20,840
way to get into it whatever you're

3812
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:24,120
passionate about doing

3813
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:25,719
do that whatever whatever speaks to you

3814
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:29,399
um I do

3815
02:27:25,719 --> 02:27:30,438
think a lot of people get into the get

3816
02:27:29,398 --> 02:27:31,920
get the idea in their head that they're

3817
02:27:30,439 --> 02:27:33,840
going to do a photo to Auto and once

3818
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:35,398
they get to the F2 Generation realize

3819
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:36,960
you know maybe I don't have the room to

3820
02:27:35,398 --> 02:27:40,119
properly do this to where I'm not going

3821
02:27:36,959 --> 02:27:41,119
to be able to pull out from this 25%

3822
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:43,319
that show

3823
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:46,319
Auto the actual things that I was

3824
02:27:43,318 --> 02:27:48,879
looking for and they get discouraged but

3825
02:27:46,318 --> 02:27:50,879
don't man there's just just keep going

3826
02:27:48,879 --> 02:27:52,959
keep pushing forward you know find a

3827
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:55,639
male you like in that first run save the

3828
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:57,358
pollen from that do the next run use

3829
02:27:55,639 --> 02:27:59,159
that pollen on a female you like like

3830
02:27:57,359 --> 02:28:02,840
there's multiple ways to do it and move

3831
02:27:59,159 --> 02:28:04,159
it forward and and do it properly um but

3832
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:06,799
also at this point in time there's

3833
02:28:04,159 --> 02:28:09,680
enough photo or enough Auto per uh Auto

3834
02:28:06,799 --> 02:28:12,318
periods enough Auto flowers out there

3835
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:16,239
that you can do auto to Auto and create

3836
02:28:12,318 --> 02:28:18,959
something completely new um but yeah

3837
02:28:16,239 --> 02:28:21,520
really get a pack of Autos just like you

3838
02:28:18,959 --> 02:28:23,759
said but now there's there's there's a

3839
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:25,359
ton of ways to do it whatever whatever

3840
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:28,960
speaks to you is the way you should do

3841
02:28:25,359 --> 02:28:30,520
it I love that it's it is good to it is

3842
02:28:28,959 --> 02:28:32,719
good to know the seed stock you're

3843
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:35,200
working from I always would recommend

3844
02:28:32,719 --> 02:28:37,119
you know sink your teeth into the

3845
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:38,800
genetics on one side or the other

3846
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:40,640
whether it's the auto or the photo so

3847
02:28:38,799 --> 02:28:44,159
that way you know which traits to select

3848
02:28:40,639 --> 02:28:46,159
for or against um but other than that

3849
02:28:44,159 --> 02:28:47,879
yeah man it's really just whatever

3850
02:28:46,159 --> 02:28:50,359
whatever speaks to

3851
02:28:47,879 --> 02:28:52,159
you beautiful beautiful I love that

3852
02:28:50,359 --> 02:28:53,840
answer you know just get passionate and

3853
02:28:52,159 --> 02:28:56,039
get into it and the path will reveal

3854
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:58,520
itself that's awesome so I think it's

3855
02:28:56,040 --> 02:29:01,399
about time we did our quickfire final

3856
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:03,439
five so the first one what's the best or

3857
02:29:01,398 --> 02:29:05,840
most memorable experience with cannabis

3858
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:05,840
you've ever

3859
02:29:06,239 --> 02:29:12,680
had well honestly I look back I was at a

3860
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:16,279
point in my life at the

3861
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:18,079
time where going to Spain and you know

3862
02:29:16,279 --> 02:29:21,079
sleeping on the floor outside of grow

3863
02:29:18,079 --> 02:29:23,239
tents and just busting my ass

3864
02:29:21,079 --> 02:29:25,840
in Spain was one of the best times of my

3865
02:29:23,239 --> 02:29:28,000
life I love that I really felt like a

3866
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:30,318
kinship and a Brotherhood with the guys

3867
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,879
of the time in misto and like we really

3868
02:29:30,318 --> 02:29:35,478
clicked and were firing on all cylinders

3869
02:29:32,879 --> 02:29:37,879
and we're really making a dent in the

3870
02:29:35,478 --> 02:29:39,920
progress and the evolution of this plant

3871
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:41,079
and I really do look back super fondly

3872
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:42,600
on that that was like some of my

3873
02:29:41,079 --> 02:29:46,159
favorite times and it's one of the the

3874
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:47,960
reasons I really like always will hold

3875
02:29:46,159 --> 02:29:50,478
those guys in high regards is because

3876
02:29:47,959 --> 02:29:52,759
like that was super special to me I

3877
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:55,519
really truly cherish that

3878
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:57,880
time yeah that's that's brilliant I love

3879
02:29:55,520 --> 02:30:00,079
that answer I love that so on the other

3880
02:29:57,879 --> 02:30:01,879
end of the spectrum what was one strain

3881
02:30:00,079 --> 02:30:03,600
that all your friends had hyped up you

3882
02:30:01,879 --> 02:30:07,000
were really excited to try and then when

3883
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:07,000
you did you were a little let

3884
02:30:08,478 --> 02:30:14,239
down let me think on that one what have

3885
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:16,880
I been disappointed

3886
02:30:14,239 --> 02:30:19,639
by I

3887
02:30:16,879 --> 02:30:20,599
really I honestly can't think of one I I

3888
02:30:19,639 --> 02:30:25,559
like

3889
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:29,520
weed a lot I really do um I think I one

3890
02:30:25,559 --> 02:30:31,600
time got a roadkill skunk from somebody

3891
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:34,040
that now looking back in

3892
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:35,439
retrospect I couldn't even I I couldn't

3893
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:37,560
take more than two hits of The Joint

3894
02:30:35,439 --> 02:30:40,600
because it was so [ __ ] gross but I

3895
02:30:37,559 --> 02:30:42,159
think now knowing that person's history

3896
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:47,200
and seeing how

3897
02:30:42,159 --> 02:30:49,119
they were and insane sociopath wiar I

3898
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:52,479
think they sprayed some skunk spray on

3899
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:56,240
that like some some actual skunk spray

3900
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:59,239
stuff and I smoked some really bad [ __ ]

3901
02:30:56,239 --> 02:31:01,159
and I think that was the the one of the

3902
02:30:59,239 --> 02:31:04,559
worst experiences with cannabis I ever

3903
02:31:01,159 --> 02:31:06,520
had um but speaking of I I did recently

3904
02:31:04,559 --> 02:31:08,359
and I think I mentioned this to you

3905
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:10,920
earlier when we were chatting I did get

3906
02:31:08,359 --> 02:31:12,720
gifted a roadkill skunk cut that you

3907
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:14,398
know somebody reached out to me through

3908
02:31:12,719 --> 02:31:16,840
email three or four times and I just

3909
02:31:14,398 --> 02:31:18,840
kind of ignored it it was another skunk

3910
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:21,920
Tail as I like to call it where you know

3911
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:26,200
it had the SWS sorted history and lots

3912
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:29,159
of negativity around it and anyway they

3913
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:30,760
they went on to reach out on Reddit and

3914
02:31:29,159 --> 02:31:32,680
a few other places and I finally

3915
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:34,000
responded to him and he was like yeah

3916
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:37,040
man I've been trying to give this to

3917
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,639
like CSI and archive and top dog and all

3918
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:40,640
these people and nobody will respond to

3919
02:31:38,639 --> 02:31:42,398
me and like I see what you're doing I've

3920
02:31:40,639 --> 02:31:44,239
grown your plants they're amazing and

3921
02:31:42,398 --> 02:31:46,959
like I know you're an auto guy but would

3922
02:31:44,239 --> 02:31:51,159
you would you be interested in taking

3923
02:31:46,959 --> 02:31:53,239
this I was like [ __ ] it I got a a pretty

3924
02:31:51,159 --> 02:31:54,840
serious quarantine going at the moment

3925
02:31:53,239 --> 02:31:56,920
so I wasn't really at risk of anything I

3926
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:58,398
didn't have any like projects going that

3927
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:01,079
could be put at risk if for some reason

3928
02:31:58,398 --> 02:32:02,599
I did take in a dirty clone so I took it

3929
02:32:01,079 --> 02:32:05,559
in

3930
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:07,800
and the gentleman went on IC mag and

3931
02:32:05,559 --> 02:32:10,199
started talking about it and posted

3932
02:32:07,799 --> 02:32:12,039
pictures of it and you know the the

3933
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:14,040
internet is full of sleuths and

3934
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:15,640
detectives and people found that the

3935
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:17,160
pictures he were post he was posting

3936
02:32:15,639 --> 02:32:20,079
were from somebody else's grow they

3937
02:32:17,159 --> 02:32:21,398
weren't the actual plant and then he had

3938
02:32:20,079 --> 02:32:25,439
like a whole bunch of stories to try to

3939
02:32:21,398 --> 02:32:28,079
cover cover up for that and then he like

3940
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:30,359
thought that I was somehow trying to

3941
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:31,879
take advantage of something or lying

3942
02:32:30,359 --> 02:32:33,399
because somebody else reached out to me

3943
02:32:31,879 --> 02:32:36,278
with some skunks and said they wanted me

3944
02:32:33,398 --> 02:32:39,760
to work their skunks in the auto and

3945
02:32:36,279 --> 02:32:42,000
just for the sake of um just so nothing

3946
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:44,079
got Lost in Translation I made a post

3947
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,398
saying you know somebody else has these

3948
02:32:44,079 --> 02:32:48,520
three guns they're going to send me I

3949
02:32:45,398 --> 02:32:51,199
want to make this post here just for

3950
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:52,840
posterity sake that I do have your skunk

3951
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,319
and if I do get these other three skunks

3952
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:57,239
I'll have those as well he sent me three

3953
02:32:55,318 --> 02:32:59,039
cuting so he was like oh he's trying to

3954
02:32:57,239 --> 02:33:00,478
say that this isn't my skunk that he's

3955
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:03,200
getting these free skunks from somebody

3956
02:33:00,478 --> 02:33:04,959
else anyway this thread just went like

3957
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:07,640
haywire and he eventually got banned

3958
02:33:04,959 --> 02:33:09,519
from IC mag and just because of this one

3959
02:33:07,639 --> 02:33:11,478
thread you know he's talking [ __ ] about

3960
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:13,000
all this and so I've been I've just been

3961
02:33:11,478 --> 02:33:14,159
letting it veg I just haven't really

3962
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:17,760
done anything with it because I didn't

3963
02:33:14,159 --> 02:33:21,200
know how to feel about it and man the I

3964
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:22,920
was just with it a few minutes ago veg

3965
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:24,640
uh but holy [ __ ] if it doesn't smell

3966
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:27,200
like true road kill skunk I don't know

3967
02:33:24,639 --> 02:33:28,519
what does I sent out a t-shirt recently

3968
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:30,640
that got picked up by the Postal

3969
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:32,720
Inspector nothing else just a t-shirt

3970
02:33:30,639 --> 02:33:34,478
that was in the room with that plant and

3971
02:33:32,719 --> 02:33:37,079
that's how strong the smell is was that

3972
02:33:34,478 --> 02:33:40,278
you know a shirt got picked up in the

3973
02:33:37,079 --> 02:33:43,079
mail because of of this plant so I'm

3974
02:33:40,279 --> 02:33:46,159
super stoked to work with this um again

3975
02:33:43,079 --> 02:33:49,920
it's got a really kind of interesting

3976
02:33:46,159 --> 02:33:51,879
history and I don't know what it really

3977
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:55,559
is it really is I think he says it's a

3978
02:33:51,879 --> 02:33:57,119
1988 roadkill skunk that his dad who

3979
02:33:55,559 --> 02:33:59,600
passed away had and it's like this

3980
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:04,880
family heirloom thing it came from the

3981
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:08,079
right part of the country um but who who

3982
02:34:04,879 --> 02:34:09,839
actually knows what it is but holy [ __ ]

3983
02:34:08,079 --> 02:34:12,398
man does that thing smell like true road

3984
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:14,120
kill stun so I'm finally at the point

3985
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:15,680
where I'm like comfortable enough to to

3986
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:18,600
put it into flower and like see what

3987
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:19,880
it's about and yeah go from there and

3988
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:22,000
it's funny because he ended up losing

3989
02:34:19,879 --> 02:34:23,478
the cut so I sent it back to him and he

3990
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,959
lost it again I sent it back to him

3991
02:34:23,478 --> 02:34:27,519
again like I said it's just been in veg

3992
02:34:24,959 --> 02:34:29,438
for like six months at this point and

3993
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:32,479
yeah so now he was like man thank you so

3994
02:34:29,439 --> 02:34:33,720
much this is like my family heritage

3995
02:34:32,478 --> 02:34:35,358
here like the fact that you got this

3996
02:34:33,719 --> 02:34:36,959
back to me my my dad was probably

3997
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:39,600
rolling over it his grave when I lost

3998
02:34:36,959 --> 02:34:42,519
this so thank you so much and it felt

3999
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:46,559
nice to be able to do that too um but

4000
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:48,319
yeah I'm um super stoked on on this and

4001
02:34:46,559 --> 02:34:49,760
I wish I had my road kill scum shirt

4002
02:34:48,318 --> 02:34:52,199
that you got on I bought one of those

4003
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:54,680
Duke to and lost it somewhere in my

4004
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:57,760
travels across the country but yeah this

4005
02:34:54,680 --> 02:35:00,880
is the first thing that I've had that is

4006
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:02,880
like might be for real the real deal

4007
02:35:00,879 --> 02:35:06,239
roadkill skunk and you know I'm hesitant

4008
02:35:02,879 --> 02:35:08,879
to even say that because you you know as

4009
02:35:06,239 --> 02:35:11,639
well as anybody how how saying that can

4010
02:35:08,879 --> 02:35:13,719
even get you you know looked at sideways

4011
02:35:11,639 --> 02:35:15,519
so I've kept it under wraps I think I've

4012
02:35:13,719 --> 02:35:18,679
posted about it maybe once on on

4013
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:20,840
Instagram but yeah that's something that

4014
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:23,439
man it blew me away the past few weeks

4015
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:26,079
just the smell off it is just absolutely

4016
02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:27,680
out of this world he he asked me if I

4017
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:29,920
would self fit and like release the

4018
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:32,040
photo period seeds of it so it's like

4019
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,040
out there still he was like this is your

4020
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:36,240
clone like to do whatever you want with

4021
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:39,520
you can give it out but after the post

4022
02:35:36,239 --> 02:35:41,039
on IC mag like I I signed up just to

4023
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:42,880
like comment on this dude's thread and

4024
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:44,359
be like yeah he did send it to me

4025
02:35:42,879 --> 02:35:45,799
immediately started having people reach

4026
02:35:44,359 --> 02:35:47,359
out actually somebody on Instagram

4027
02:35:45,799 --> 02:35:49,000
reached out was like are you the dzz

4028
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:50,960
that got this road kill stun from this

4029
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:52,600
dude down south or whatever he like yeah

4030
02:35:50,959 --> 02:35:53,959
he's over like talking on a thread about

4031
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:56,800
it right now so I went over and checked

4032
02:35:53,959 --> 02:35:58,799
it out timed in on there and that's

4033
02:35:56,799 --> 02:36:02,920
where things got sideways with the the

4034
02:35:58,799 --> 02:36:04,840
three skunks and so yeah anyway I'm

4035
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:07,318
super stoked to to finally get that into

4036
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:09,000
flower and see if if the smell continues

4037
02:36:07,318 --> 02:36:11,559
through flour and then into the the

4038
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,799
cured product because man this is like

4039
02:36:11,559 --> 02:36:15,318
it might be that missing link that

4040
02:36:12,799 --> 02:36:18,318
everybody has been been after for so

4041
02:36:15,318 --> 02:36:20,239
long we'll all have to wait and see how

4042
02:36:18,318 --> 02:36:22,519
it pans out that that would be really

4043
02:36:20,239 --> 02:36:25,439
exciting if it did and and hey if it's

4044
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:28,800
the real deal uh s1's what a way to make

4045
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:32,600
a splash into the photo world I reckon

4046
02:36:28,799 --> 02:36:34,199
so um on on to the the next question is

4047
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:35,640
our desert island question you know I'm

4048
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:37,600
going to drop you off on a desert island

4049
02:36:35,639 --> 02:36:39,358
you can take three clones or three packs

4050
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:41,159
of seeds what are you going to take with

4051
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:44,680
you to grow for the rest of

4052
02:36:41,159 --> 02:36:47,159
time well I I made a stream called

4053
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:48,840
desert I desert Isle that was like one

4054
02:36:47,159 --> 02:36:51,279
of my favorite indicas cross one of my

4055
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:52,760
favorites a was that was made with the

4056
02:36:51,279 --> 02:36:55,079
intention of like you know if I ever

4057
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:56,719
needed to I could F2 this and then go

4058
02:36:55,079 --> 02:36:58,719
from there and pick out like all the

4059
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:00,920
different stuff from both sides that I

4060
02:36:58,719 --> 02:37:03,000
wanted to so that would probably be one

4061
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:04,760
of them that's got the Zod Delica

4062
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,680
Express in it so that's one I mean

4063
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:08,239
zelica Express would be one if it wasn't

4064
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:10,000
for that strain and knowing that I would

4065
02:37:08,239 --> 02:37:13,359
have the ability to dig in and like

4066
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:17,520
refine some stuff from that um yeah I'm

4067
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:21,439
gonna say the the desert aisle desert

4068
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:22,800
aisle strain the probably Cosmic Queen

4069
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:25,880
would be another one just because that

4070
02:37:22,799 --> 02:37:28,679
one is so so special and sentimental to

4071
02:37:25,879 --> 02:37:32,639
me

4072
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:37,120
and let's see that's a really tough one

4073
02:37:32,639 --> 02:37:39,439
I'm um you know for for I've Got What I

4074
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:41,840
Call owl pellets which every seed

4075
02:37:39,439 --> 02:37:44,318
Harvest I've ever made I throw some up

4076
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:46,559
into a jar and I sell those as a mystery

4077
02:37:44,318 --> 02:37:48,600
mix I might just grab a handful of those

4078
02:37:46,559 --> 02:37:50,278
and then toss those in just for for

4079
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:53,279
shits and giggles and you know find what

4080
02:37:50,279 --> 02:37:55,239
I find when I find it I love that that's

4081
02:37:53,279 --> 02:37:56,960
cool you know you got the time let's

4082
02:37:55,239 --> 02:38:00,318
let's have fun with it that's beautiful

4083
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:03,438
so yeah the next question is if you had

4084
02:38:00,318 --> 02:38:06,199
to restart the company with just one

4085
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:07,279
pack of your current seeds which pack

4086
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:09,680
would you

4087
02:38:07,279 --> 02:38:11,800
pick dude this is my biggest fear I

4088
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:14,800
think about this almost on a weekly

4089
02:38:11,799 --> 02:38:16,679
basis of like what would happen I I

4090
02:38:14,799 --> 02:38:18,478
there's been times in my life especially

4091
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:21,040
moving across country where I split up

4092
02:38:18,478 --> 02:38:22,799
my seed stock into half and I'll send

4093
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:24,319
half and drive with the other half just

4094
02:38:22,799 --> 02:38:26,920
in case like something happens or

4095
02:38:24,318 --> 02:38:29,159
doesn't make it then you know see each

4096
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:31,478
other at the Finish Line sort of thing

4097
02:38:29,159 --> 02:38:33,639
but if I was to to start over with just

4098
02:38:31,478 --> 02:38:36,639
one seed

4099
02:38:33,639 --> 02:38:36,639
pack

4100
02:38:37,478 --> 02:38:43,000
wow zelic Express tends to to be

4101
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:45,120
dominant in crosses so I don't feel like

4102
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:48,079
that would be one that

4103
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:51,000
would I don't think that would be the

4104
02:38:48,079 --> 02:38:52,520
one oh man this is a really really tough

4105
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:55,478
question it'd have to be a pack of Auto

4106
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:57,520
EGS just for for the sake of it probably

4107
02:38:55,478 --> 02:39:01,199
Wizards Apprentice or or blue microverse

4108
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:03,120
one of those two I'd say um yeah both of

4109
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:04,920
those I'm super confident in I'm I'm

4110
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:06,439
extremely happy with the results of them

4111
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:07,719
I know how they breed I know what I can

4112
02:39:06,439 --> 02:39:10,439
pull out of them I know which way to

4113
02:39:07,719 --> 02:39:12,519
turn at any given generation with them

4114
02:39:10,439 --> 02:39:14,159
so I feel like one of those would would

4115
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:16,200
be it probably the Wizards Apprentice

4116
02:39:14,159 --> 02:39:19,639
because it's bigger overall it's got a

4117
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:21,600
little bit Hardy hardier structure to it

4118
02:39:19,639 --> 02:39:25,079
um yeah let's go with Wizards

4119
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:27,359
ofenis a great pick a great pick now

4120
02:39:25,079 --> 02:39:29,439
final question I've got a time machine

4121
02:39:27,359 --> 02:39:32,279
for you you can go anywhere anytime any

4122
02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:33,920
place what are you gonna get I'd go with

4123
02:39:32,279 --> 02:39:36,239
bod on some of his trips around the

4124
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:37,680
world and see what he's seen you know

4125
02:39:36,239 --> 02:39:41,439
what I mean like that dude's lived a

4126
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:44,520
life and I'd love to to to be along for

4127
02:39:41,439 --> 02:39:46,398
the ride and I know you asked him that

4128
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:49,120
same question so wherever he was going

4129
02:39:46,398 --> 02:39:50,599
I'd be right there with him that's it

4130
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:52,560
that's I can't remember I think he said

4131
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:56,359
he'd go to the Ewok village and smoke

4132
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:59,039
with them which again let's do it um I'm

4133
02:39:56,359 --> 02:40:01,359
down so I think that just about brings

4134
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:02,479
us to the end of it any comments

4135
02:40:01,359 --> 02:40:05,359
thoughts shout

4136
02:40:02,478 --> 02:40:07,079
