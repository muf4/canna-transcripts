from chimera

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,519
let's get into it

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,118
[Music]

50
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,280
a lot of people over the years have

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,200
expressed concern to me around the idea

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,318
of the development of such a strain

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,640
whereby you know it's it's approximately

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,479
the same height structure profile

55
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,639
terpenes it's got all these traits on

56
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,719
lockdown such that you know like a big

57
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,039
combined harvester can just harvest a

58
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,439
field of it perfectly and it just goes

59
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,679
through to production that sort of idea

60
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,479
and the the fear that gets expressed

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,439
with this sort of end outcome is that we

62
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,639
could lose genetic diversity if these

63
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,199
populations were to hermaphrodite or to

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,958
put pollen out that sort of thing

65
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,719
do you think that that is a legitimate

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
concern or do you think that it's more

67
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,159
akin to the way there's corn and then

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840
there's heirloom corn you know they both

69
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,400
still exist

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,479
genetic diversity for me is a concern

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,719
for every species on the planet

72
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,959
and so cannabis being

73
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,759
one that i've chosen to be a custodian

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
of

75
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,518
hell yeah genetic diversity is a hugely

76
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,199
important thing

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,719
and i think that everybody needs to

78
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,639
practice good

79
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,560
prac you know we need to be

80
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,318
doing open popping like whenever

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,598
whenever i do a population like for

82
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,439
example when we do the blueberry stuff

83
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,799
with dj we grew all the stuff and we

84
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,639
just let it open pollinate we didn't

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
make we didn't do a lot of seed from it

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,679
but we let it all get a little bit of

87
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,799
seed and all that seed got bulked

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
together

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
right and it's like now you've got

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,319
everything

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,640
right

92
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,639
and that goes in the freezer somewhere

93
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,518
um or a fridge somewhere whatever into

94
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,199
your long-term germplasm storage and

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
then you start working from the clones

96
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,439
of the individuals and creating sub

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,120
families but the first step is the open

98
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,840
pollination the first step is the

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,519
preservation of the genes in the pool

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
right because it doesn't stop you from

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
doing any other type of breeding

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
down line you know you might want to

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
open pollinate the whole thing and

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,959
collect all the seeds from all the

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
plants and then you've got it all again

106
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,878
right and you don't have to do that for

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,039
another 25 years right and then you can

108
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,438
take the one clone and make seeds from

109
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,400
that one plant right so now you've got

110
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,120
an inbred version of your population and

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,519
the the breadth of the genetic diversity

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
in another population in the fridge

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,799
right um

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,039
and i think that's a crucial part of if

115
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,959
you're serious about germplasm

116
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,120
preservation or genetic preservation of

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,160
a crop that's what you do

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
right you

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,040
you preserve it and then you improve it

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,120
and you put the preserved stuff in the

121
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
freezer and then you can

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,478
improve the line and then if you want

123
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,239
you can go back to the original

124
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,240
population or cross the new line to the

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,519
old line or whatever your options are

126
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
limitless

127
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,279
but if you didn't do the preservation

128
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,319
you can't go back

129
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,599
right

130
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,800
um

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
so yeah

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
hugely important for all plant breeders

133
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
and and definitely people need to be

134
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,720
starting thinking about it

135
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,719
um

136
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
is

137
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,039
making uniform seed going to compromise

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,360
the genetic diversity of the species i

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,680
don't think so because again

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
you might be able to make that new new

141
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
line

142
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
where all the plants look the same with

143
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,719
a small subset of your population

144
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,478
but as long as you've got that genetic

145
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
diversity that you've preserved in the

146
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,478
first place you're not really losing

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,519
anything right

148
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,359
sure

149
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,799
sure sure

150
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,199
so just to jump back one question

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,960
you raise a brilliant point and one i've

152
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,680
actually kind of struggled to navigate

153
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,918
the minefield of myself in that a lot of

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,478
people in the community use like the

155
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,560
incorrect sort of nomenclature around

156
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,478
certain topics and my suspicion is that

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,280
it arises from the fact that a lot of

158
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,478
growers are genuinely very inquisitive

159
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,000
and curious

160
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:40,959
and so they try to look into things and

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,879
often

162
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,560
you know words get used in the wrong

163
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,800
context because maybe there was never

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,680
like a formal education around what it's

165
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
used and and often it leads to just

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,199
people like myself using the wrong terms

167
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,199
just so that people can kind of

168
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
understand what we're talking about the

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
question becomes do you think there ever

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,879
will become a sort of formalized

171
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,038
nomenclature around cannabis and like an

172
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,680
effort to set it straight and the reason

173
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,240
why i specifically reference this is

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,560
because we're seeing a shift with

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
seeds instead of being called s ones

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
people calling them r ones and whether

177
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,520
that's correct or not it makes me

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
realize that people are starting to

179
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,159
think about this sort of thing what's

180
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,120
your thoughts what's r1 reversal

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
yeah

182
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,038
well that's silly because yeah that's

183
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
silly because it's a it's a s1 means

184
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,038
self

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,279
right so

186
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,879
yeah yeah after

187
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,239
you have to reverse one plant but that

188
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,439
plant that you reverse doesn't make the

189
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,879
seeds i think that's a weird thing to

190
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,560
call it s1s

191
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,159
and it's actually kind of funny i think

192
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,038
it's actually a good way to make this

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
point

194
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,879
the cannabis world kind of likes to be

195
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
on its own you know you asked the

196
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,719
question that you asked was will we ever

197
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,360
get to a standard point in time

198
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,600
where everybody uses a strict set of

199
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
terminology that's correct

200
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,160
i mean

201
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
there is a whole strict set of

202
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,599
terminology that's correct and the rest

203
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,598
of the plant world uses it but for some

204
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,279
reason stoners don't

205
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,598
right um

206
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,399
and it's it's no fault of our own like

207
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,000
when

208
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,079
listen when somebody teaches you

209
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,839
something the wrong way

210
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,598
and you we all learn it and we all think

211
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,119
that it's right and then all of a sudden

212
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,800
one person learns that hey we all

213
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
learned it wrong it's pretty hard for

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
the rest of the people to come back and

215
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,639
turn around

216
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,120
right so words like strain sativa indica

217
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,120
like all those words are used wrong

218
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,478
right like i even used it earlier i used

219
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,199
the word

220
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,038
um calex k there's no calyxes the

221
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,400
cannabis doesn't have calyxes cannabis

222
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,038
has braggs

223
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,439
right but again when and i'm not blaming

224
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,598
rob but rob in in marijuana botany he

225
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,560
misused some of these words

226
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:43,839
and

227
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,598
you know he learned them the wrong way

228
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,598
as well he was taught them the wrong way

229
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,120
it's i'm not trying to put any blame on

230
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,038
rob for this

231
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,360
um

232
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,120
so let's dive into the sativa indica

233
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,038
thing for a second here

234
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,680
sativa so

235
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,360
let's start with indica indica means

236
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,759
from india

237
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
right like there's there's other plants

238
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
that are from india

239
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,080
and they're like you know medicago

240
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,079
indica for example right like

241
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,918
indica means from india well if you look

242
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,199
at plants from india the cannabis plants

243
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,878
from india what are they like they're

244
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,038
equatorial they've got long thin leaves

245
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,439
right

246
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,038
but we call those plants sativas

247
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,000
well sativas

248
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,759
sativa means useful or cultivated it's

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,158
latin for

250
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,519
it's kind of got a bi meaning it's like

251
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,200
useful or or cultivated

252
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
um

253
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,759
peas are piss

254
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,879
sativum right and again that sativum is

255
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,958
the same

256
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,559
root word which means useful right so

257
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,559
somebody had taken

258
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,039
a plant out of that collection and found

259
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,958
a a use for it really is what it was

260
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,278
what it is and they they cultivated it

261
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,599
in out of the wild it's kind of like the

262
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,120
process of taking it out of the wild and

263
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,480
and putting it into into your own

264
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
domestic cultivation is

265
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,838
is what the word sativa means well the

266
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,599
plants that we mean to be that the

267
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,120
plants that were first described by

268
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
linneas

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,679
to as cannabis sativa

270
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
were hemp it wasn't drug cannabis it was

271
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,838
hemp

272
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:23,039
right and hemp plants have narrow leaves

273
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,279
and really tall stems

274
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,278
okay

275
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,958
so what are the so what are the wide

276
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,958
plants then with the wide the really

277
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,799
short stocky plants with the super wide

278
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:36,159
leaves that we call indica they're

279
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,359
actually afghan so they're afghanica

280
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,159
so

281
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,919
what we call af what we call indica is

282
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,958
really afghanica

283
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:49,120
what we call sativa is really indica

284
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,958
and sativa is really meant for hemp

285
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
right well that might sound all

286
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,359
interesting and everything but like how

287
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
the hell are we gonna get everybody to

288
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
get on board and understand that that's

289
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,639
what it is

290
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,399
right like i mean even yourself you're

291
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,759
like a highly informed person in the

292
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
space

293
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,838
and we still use these terms right and i

294
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,839
i'm not trying to

295
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
you know make you feel bad or dumb about

296
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
that it's like i run into this like

297
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,320
every day with people right it's like

298
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,719
everybody i interact with it's like oh

299
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,240
this is a diva this is a strain you know

300
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,240
the word strain

301
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,159
the plant people that do the name the

302
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
the naming of plants in the world they

303
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,439
kind of oversee there's like another

304
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,480
organization

305
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,079
um

306
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,159
that kind of ha that develops the

307
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,000
taxonomy and the names for plants they

308
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,719
don't use the word strain

309
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,039
right strain is simply reserved for

310
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
bacteria and

311
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,039
viruses right so you can have like

312
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,879
covid19 is a strain

313
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,360
right and it's this the reason it's

314
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,919
called the sort of the coronavirus

315
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,639
that we call covid the reason is that is

316
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,799
that

317
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,639
it it has that name is that that

318
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,559
all all

319
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,519
individuals within that family that came

320
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,439
from a common ancestor since it's spread

321
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,200
all over the world it's undergone all

322
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,079
these mutations in its genes so it's

323
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,079
actually no longer one individual

324
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,679
genetic type reproducing itself it's

325
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,519
become like a hairball of all these

326
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,120
different genetic types that are

327
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,879
reproducing themselves the reason that

328
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,679
we all call them

329
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,919
um

330
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,120
you know the covid strain of coronavirus

331
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,838
or whatever

332
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,320
is

333
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,760
that they all induce the same phenotype

334
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,120
in humans

335
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,759
right which is the coronavirus disease

336
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,759
or covid

337
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,278
so

338
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
really people that are using the word

339
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,919
strain should stop if you know if it

340
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,759
would be my recommendation

341
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,120
what you're calling what you refer to as

342
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:42,159
a strain like for example blue dream

343
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,600
is a specific clonal type that has been

344
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,600
selected from a population

345
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,759
and every plant that subsequently comes

346
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
from that clone or from other mother

347
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,319
plants of that clone

348
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,278
that should be called a cultivar okay

349
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
cultivars don't necessarily breed true

350
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,439
um but as long as you propagate them

351
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,519
through clones

352
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,760
the traits that we refer to that you

353
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,159
know the traits that we named we have or

354
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,480
somebody has named blue dream

355
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,240
all of those traits are consistently

356
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,759
re they consistently come from the

357
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,200
plants

358
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,360
as long as you're taking cuttings of it

359
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,160
okay

360
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
yeah

361
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,120
if you then cross that plant to itself

362
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,719
or one member of its family and all the

363
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,440
plants came out

364
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,399
again identical to blue dream that would

365
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,200
be called a variety so a variety is a

366
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
seed family that reproduces a type when

367
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,440
you

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,958
inbreed it

369
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
through sexual

370
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,199
recombination

371
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,919
a cultivar is a plant that maintains it

372
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,320
type its type when you reproduce it

373
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,399
through clone okay and so i think

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,639
cultivar is the word that people mean

375
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,720
when they say strain

376
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,639
and there's probably not enough

377
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,639
true cannabis varieties yet for that to

378
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,240
really be too too relevant to most

379
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,079
people

380
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
um

381
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,399
pinot noir for example it's a clonally

382
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,079
propagated plant that's a cultivar it's

383
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,200
not a strain like you'll never hear i

384
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,439
mean

385
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,120
you hear it occasionally but

386
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
the plant people would never call it a

387
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
strain

388
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,799
right

389
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
yeah um

390
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,799
and so that's kind of why i lean away

391
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,278
from words like indica and sativa and i

392
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,639
try to tell people or i try to i try to

393
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,320
use the words all i can do is set an

394
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,879
example by using my you know these words

395
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,720
myself and i kind of try to use the word

396
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,399
equatorial for

397
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,839
what you've been referring to

398
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,000
colloquially as sativa

399
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,000
right um

400
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,839
and then afghanica i think is the best

401
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
word for

402
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,120
indica

403
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,759
again

404
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,679
linnaeus the guy that did this work was

405
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,519
you know whatever over 100 years ago

406
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,278
well over 100 years ago

407
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,200
and then when the drug cannabis growers

408
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,879
started getting into cannabis and call

409
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,879
it the late 50s or maybe 60s and 70s

410
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,000
that's really when the words sativa and

411
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,320
indica

412
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,519
appeared in our pop culture vernacular

413
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,600
or even our cannabis culture vernacular

414
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,159
and

415
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,680
it's pretty understandable that

416
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,000
they went and read the scientific

417
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,679
literature and and decided oh look this

418
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,240
plant is tall and it has thin leaves

419
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,559
it's probably sativa without realizing

420
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,360
that linnaeus was describing a hemp

421
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,919
plant not a drug cannabis plant

422
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,759
right and and same with the indica right

423
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,599
so really

424
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,439
it becomes hard when

425
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
everybody is using the words to mean

426
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
different things it's again it's like

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,199
we're talking with terps and we don't

428
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,319
have a

429
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,399
a consistent um

430
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
agreed upon definition right everybody's

431
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,559
got their own definition of what the

432
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,919
word these words mean right so someone

433
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,679
says oh i got a strain of cannabis and

434
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,958
it's like oh yeah well what what what's

435
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,399
a strain

436
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,439
ask them what a strain is and it's like

437
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,278
watch them try to figure out what it is

438
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,680
right because a strain

439
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,360
a strain when it reproduces it should

440
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,439
always reproduce the type but if you

441
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
breed a cannabis to a cannabis plant to

442
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
itself

443
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,479
and it's a cultivar it's a hybrid

444
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,959
cultivar when you breed it to itself it

445
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,959
falls apart the kids no longer look like

446
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,359
the mother right and that's the real

447
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,799
problem in the seed market because

448
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,159
some dude gets the cutting again we'll

449
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,519
stick with blue dream some dude gets a

450
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,958
cutting of blue dream and he's like i'm

451
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,919
gonna make a bunch of money or he or she

452
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,000
thinks they're gonna make a bunch of

453
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,240
money making seeds from blue dreams so

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,639
they take one copy of the clone and they

455
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,720
reverse it with their sts and

456
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,198
take that pollen and put it on their

457
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,278
their other plant

458
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,479
and then they put they harvest all the

459
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,159
seeds and they put them in a bag and

460
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
they label it blue dream

461
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,078
right and those seeds go off to the seed

462
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,600
vendor and he puts them on his website

463
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,679
and puts them in a package it says blue

464
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,159
dream and when you grow the seeds out

465
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,719
they look nothing like the parent

466
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,399
right so the word blue dream becomes

467
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
meaningless

468
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,198
right because again it doesn't you know

469
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,119
then that goes out onto the market

470
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,639
and some guys let he finds a plant

471
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
that's totally different from blue dream

472
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,519
and he's selling into his market as blue

473
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,759
dream

474
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839
and now the public has no idea what blue

475
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,600
dream even means

476
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
right like if you go into a grocery

477
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,240
store and you buy a macintosh apple and

478
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,560
you're in vermont or australia or like

479
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
london uk or amsterdam it's the same

480
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,000
apple

481
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,519
right because it's

482
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,759
it's been registered as a plant variety

483
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,679
right and they get that when you when

484
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,440
that process happens that's when you get

485
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,799
to put the name on the plant and you get

486
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,079
the commercial rights to the plant and

487
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,078
the name

488
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,439
right some other dude can't come along

489
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,198
and start like

490
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
selling an apple in his backyard is

491
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,719
macintosh

492
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,639
right because eventually everybody gets

493
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,160
to know the flavor of the macintosh and

494
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,240
they realize yeah that's macintosh

495
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,159
that's granny smith that's honeydew

496
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,399
right and people learn these things and

497
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,958
unfortunately we don't have that kind of

498
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,440
standardization in cannabis

499
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,838
and you actually have to be

500
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,320
of a certain level in the business with

501
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
access to lab testing and you know a bit

502
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,240
of a

503
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,198
snob like a somalia kind of snob person

504
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,798
to

505
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,798
to really understand the differences and

506
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,199
be able to pick up a plan and say that's

507
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,558
this this is the other thing you know

508
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,558
and and sort them by chemical type

509
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,918
and i'm you know

510
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,439
i like to complain about these things

511
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,439
but i mean really the only reason i

512
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
complain about it is because it needs to

513
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,360
become a talking point before people are

514
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,558
going to do anything about it

515
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,078
um

516
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,279
and you have to have some you know that

517
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,678
was one of the things that i did when we

518
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,558
were working down in california the

519
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,480
company that i was working for gave us a

520
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,839
really quite significant budget to go

521
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,798
and buy all the weed that we could find

522
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,720
in the state and run it through our lab

523
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,079
and through the process we were able to

524
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,759
start seeing

525
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,199
okay all everybody agrees that this is

526
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,160
sour diesel except for these people

527
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,759
they've got something else they're

528
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
calling sour diesel

529
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,798
or the entire market agrees that this is

530
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
blue dream except for these people

531
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,558
they've got something else this blue

532
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,319
dream and you can start

533
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,399
making a you can start linking a

534
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,359
chemical profile that that is

535
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,400
discoverable by a lab assay

536
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,159
that means the type

537
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,080
right

538
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,640
and you know a good way to think about

539
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,319
it is like if tom cruise has kids we

540
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
don't call them tom cruise and start

541
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,839
telling everybody that the kid is in top

542
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,200
gun right

543
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,439
i mean it's like it's just that

544
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,480
we all agree that the the words tom

545
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,720
cruise or whatever word you want to use

546
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,440
is a symbol for a type

547
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,759
right and that symbol and that type

548
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,880
should remain constant from group to

549
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,480
group

550
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,559
right for it to be a real thing

551
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,240
otherwise what people are doing is

552
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:39,839
they're just trying to slap a popular

553
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,558
name

554
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,319
on a different variety to sell it and

555
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,359
fool the market but really what that

556
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,279
does

557
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,719
is it just confuses the market in the

558
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,399
long term and then nobody knows what

559
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,240
every anything is and

560
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,798
it's one of the shortfalls of cannabis

561
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,798
right it's like i maybe i'm a

562
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,240
way nerding out on about it too much but

563
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,000
i i think it would be really great if

564
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
everybody understood

565
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,798
that this certain smell profile is sour

566
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,200
diesel this certain smell profile is

567
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,558
what we call blue dream

568
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,360
right

569
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,519
yeah hundred percent and uh some really

570
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,879
good food for thought and a little

571
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,319
something i'm gonna have to keep in mind

572
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,919
going forward trying to use the right

573
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,159
terminology because i'm definitely a

574
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,080
huge advocate of that's how things get

575
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,400
very muddy you know i've i've certainly

576
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,240
told a lot of people when they make some

577
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,320
s1s you know make sure to say that it's

578
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,798
an s1 you know like otherwise you have

579
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,639
that same problem you mentioned but just

580
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,599
to jump back to something we were

581
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,559
talking about earlier with the the ae77

582
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,798
cali orange i just wanted to ask there

583
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,639
is this prevalent idea that exists

584
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,319
broadly around i guess all orange

585
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,960
strains but maybe it stems from the

586
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,038
calio because it is so widely used and

587
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,519
it's like you know a common ancestor for

588
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,038
a lot of the popular ones at the moment

589
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,519
you've worked with it and you've made

590
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,240
the colors are and the c plus in your

591
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,720
experience do you think that there is a

592
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,640
link between that orange profile and a

593
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,360
lack of potency because a lot of people

594
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,600
speak as though you just can't get like

595
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,839
a an orange flavored strain that hits

596
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,038
you in the way an og does what's your

597
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,918
thoughts

598
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,079
um

599
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,679
no well no

600
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,439
yes and no probably i think the long

601
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,720
answer is no

602
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,480
um

603
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,319
and the reason is is that like like i

604
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,880
kind of mentioned to you off cam or off

605
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,879
recording

606
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,319
scent or smell is a hair heritable

607
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,000
characteristic okay

608
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,599
and so it's a trait like every like

609
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,200
anything else and it's probably a series

610
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,199
of traits that all appear as one

611
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,480
and usually when you have traits like

612
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,240
that on a given chromosome

613
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,038
they kind of get stacked in one part of

614
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,200
the chromosome and so chromosomes during

615
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,558
copying they break apart and they can

616
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,640
switch people we were talking about the

617
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,158
blue and the red chromosomes before for

618
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,840
mom and dad

619
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,640
when that

620
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,439
when that child from you know from mom

621
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,480
and dad has it goes through it's making

622
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,320
sperm or eggs or pollen

623
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,159
those pieces of chromosomes can actually

624
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,439
change little pieces of information so

625
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,799
you might get like a

626
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,679
majorly

627
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,519
blue chromosome with a little tip of red

628
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,519
and correspondingly a majorly red

629
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,200
chromosome with a little tip of blue

630
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,720
and so

631
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,679
they do exchange little pieces of

632
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,200
information the probability of

633
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,038
those

634
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
genes that are inherited on that same

635
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,079
little chunk

636
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,159
getting separated like the closer two

637
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,240
genes are on a chromosome the more

638
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,000
likely it is that they'll be inherited

639
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,640
together okay because there's less

640
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,640
chance of a crossover happening

641
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,200
um at that part of the chromosome

642
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,159
between those two genes

643
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,038
but it can happen okay

644
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,880
um it's just really low probability

645
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,879
and so

646
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,960
when you say

647
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,960
is thc and orange

648
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,960
you know are they linked to be that

649
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,558
there is no thc there's no higher

650
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,120
potency orange stuff that's really not

651
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,759
true but it takes a lot of breeding to

652
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,599
get to that point you have to it's and

653
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,558
that's a phenomenon called

654
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,480
gene linkage and so people can look up

655
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,079
on google gene linkage or even on

656
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,798
youtube i'm sure there's videos gene

657
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,119
linkage and gene linkage maps

658
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,119
and there's ways that you can

659
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,519
um

660
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,279
if you if you score traits over many

661
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,200
generations and you very diligently

662
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,119
record the traits and the occurrence the

663
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,360
number of times those traits appear on a

664
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,759
set of plants on the population you can

665
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,959
actually start to figure out how close

666
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,599
together

667
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,000
sets of genes are on

668
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,240
the chromosome okay and if you're using

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,319
genomics or molecular t techniques you

670
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,960
can actually do it a lot more quickly

671
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,399
but the idea is that you want to so it

672
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
might be

673
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
that the orange flavored genes are very

674
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,279
close on

675
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,798
the same chromosome to a version of the

676
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,558
thc gene that doesn't work very well

677
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,918
right and so what we need to do is we

678
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,639
need to take that

679
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,120
piece of the the gene for the orange

680
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,720
sorry the piece of gene for the

681
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,239
mediocre thc production and

682
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,600
switch that out

683
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,000
for a gene

684
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:19,279
that is that makes thc but it's very

685
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,279
effective at doing its job

686
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,360
and that's called breaking the linkage

687
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,038
right

688
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,879
and the closer two genes are on a

689
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,440
chromosome the harder it is to break the

690
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
linkage between those two alleles

691
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
um

692
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,038
so again these are all things that can

693
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,279
be solved with plant breeding but it

694
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,359
really takes doing like a

695
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,480
across within you you want to cross

696
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,158
probably you want to cross something

697
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
like um

698
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,159
you know an orange plant to a high thc

699
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,558
plant like cookies or og

700
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,400
and then you grow the f1 and you let

701
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,480
them all breed together and in the next

702
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,320
generation you want to grow like say 50

703
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
000 plants

704
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,639
right and when you grow that many of the

705
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,079
next generation

706
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,000
you have a higher

707
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:06,319
likelihood of finding

708
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
the plant that has all the orange flavor

709
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,678
but also

710
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,400
the high thc production of the high

711
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,240
cannabinoid production

712
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,320
um and that's just plant breeding in

713
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,919
numbers right like luther burbank used

714
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,359
to grow hundreds of thousands of plants

715
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,960
looking for i think he you know i think

716
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,798
he selected

717
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
the russet potato out of like a hundred

718
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,158
thousand plants

719
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,278
right i think that he kept two plants

720
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,278
from a hundred thousand so

721
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,960
it's

722
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,558
impressive yeah and it's a chore and

723
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,880
it's serious but it's like man you want

724
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,319
to make those improved plants

725
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
that's what you do and now when you've

726
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,599
done the work now you've got an orange

727
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,278
plant that is um

728
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,119
high in thc

729
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,558
and uh that's that's pretty cool and it

730
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,079
but it takes a lot of work to get there

731
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,599
and you certainly can't do it in the

732
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,639
closet

733
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,959
um

734
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,679
now that we have genomic tools you know

735
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,919
they can definitely aid in the breeding

736
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,360
to do that but they also have a cost

737
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,480
right you're still

738
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,319
paying

739
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,880
however many dollars per sample to have

740
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,200
every plant genotyped

741
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,720
um

742
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,480
so yeah

743
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,919
the good news is that the new ones like

744
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,200
you know some of the sherb and the new

745
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,440
things they're they're orange and

746
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,038
they're a lot more potent than the ae 77

747
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,679
is

748
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,759
yeah certainly certainly so we actually

749
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,840
had a question from one of our viewers

750
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,679
submitted about like what are your

751
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,319
thoughts on the occurrence of like the

752
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,000
supposed like one in a thousand phenos

753
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,759
and specifically

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,359
they kind of reference this idea of

755
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,679
every now and again

756
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,038
for the most part you'll see most plants

757
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,038
having just

758
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,278
lots of characteristics of the parents

759
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,879
some blended some leaning more towards

760
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,558
one or the other but every now and again

761
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,039
maybe you call it a one in a thousand

762
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,119
fino so to speak you get a plant that's

763
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,798
almost unlike either of the parents in

764
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,319
any regard

765
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,158
do you feel like this is a real sort of

766
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,158
phenomenon that occurs or do you maybe

767
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,840
it's pollen contamination and do you

768
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,520
think these one in a thousand phenoes

769
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,678
will be more sought after given we've

770
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,679
kind of discussed them a bit and how

771
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,519
there can be advantages to finding these

772
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,000
special occurring plants

773
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,440
they they can be better than the others

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,720
but they're not necessarily better i

775
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,679
think when people are talking about the

776
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,798
one in a thousand it's really most often

777
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,000
about

778
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,158
you know it's like you said you get

779
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,400
traits from mom and traits from dad

780
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,400
but like did you get all the right

781
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,480
traits for mom and all the right traits

782
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,720
from dad right that's one of the

783
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,400
thousand kind of material

784
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,759
um

785
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,278
the other thing that you might see i

786
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,079
think what you're hinting at is there

787
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,079
are these very rare

788
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,480
genetic combinations that lead to an

789
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,240
alter phenotype of some type

790
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,839
and the reason that they're rare is that

791
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,240
again it's really

792
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,480
it with with breeding it's again like i

793
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,038
said it's statistics and math it all

794
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,120
comes down to just having the right

795
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,440
genes and if you have all the right

796
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,278
combinations of genes

797
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,038
then you can get an aberrant or a

798
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,960
stranger a new

799
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,158
phenotype that was unseen in either of

800
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,200
the parents

801
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,960
but that all is based on probability

802
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,679
right um

803
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,440
and it's really just rolling the dice

804
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
over and over and over and over and over

805
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
again until you get the right

806
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,519
combination

807
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,519
of genes together

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,079
sure and i mean

809
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,719
it seems like a good point to segue into

810
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,720
some of the more advanced science and ip

811
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,038
stuff we're going to chat about

812
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,278
the first question i have in regards to

813
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,278
genes and the way they line up

814
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,720
do you to the best of your knowledge

815
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,839
know if crispr or any kind of molecular

816
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,120
editing

817
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:43,519
has been used to create altered cannabis

818
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,479
varieties i don't believe so it might

819
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,879
have been done somewhere in some lab but

820
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,400
crispr is not as easy as everybody

821
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,880
thinks it is

822
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,480
um you don't just dip a plant in crisper

823
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,799
juice for example and the whole thing

824
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,360
comes out changed right like these

825
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,839
genetic changes they happen on a single

826
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,000
single

827
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:06,158
cell right and then that single cell has

828
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,440
to have integrated the new trait

829
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,039
and

830
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,200
that single cell needs to become a new

831
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,798
plant and so when that single cell

832
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,319
divides and divides you have what are

833
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,319
called when you get a clump of cells you

834
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,519
get what are called sectors in the in

835
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,359
the cell

836
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,798
and those sectors might actually like

837
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,079
you might lose

838
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,158
the crispr

839
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,798
mutation or whatever the crispr change

840
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,960
has caused and so now you've got a plant

841
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,639
that is growing as a chimera like it's

842
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,038
actually a plant with multiple genetic

843
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,960
types within the plant

844
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,599
but what you need to have is a plant

845
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,000
that is all one genotype

846
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,558
that all incorporates the

847
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,440
you know the new crispr mutant

848
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:47,759
version of your your altered gene

849
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,759
um

850
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,918
and so

851
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,919
when you grow

852
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,000
how do i explain this when you when you

853
00:28:54,398 --> 00:29:00,000
grow cannabis plants

854
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,798
it's not like the shoot that comes off

855
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,159
of a plant it's not a single cell it's

856
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,519
an organ

857
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,799
right it's not one single diff

858
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,639
undifferentiated cell

859
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,158
it's like all the cell types are already

860
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,240
organized in a way that they know what

861
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,480
they're doing right so the the

862
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,480
equivalent to people can think about in

863
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,480
humans

864
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,038
if you've got you know the cells in your

865
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,599
heart are are heart cells they're heart

866
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,278
tissue cells the cells in your lungs or

867
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,240
lung tissue cells the

868
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,480
the

869
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,519
the nerve cells in the back of your eye

870
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,798
are eye tissue cells they're all highly

871
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,960
specialized and differentiated okay

872
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,960
now any cell type can revert to what we

873
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,200
call stem cells and plants have

874
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,519
equivalents of stem cells

875
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,000
um which is you know more or less

876
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,398
callous it's it's really like a

877
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,398
a d differentiated cell it's a cell that

878
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,479
started as an organized group of tissues

879
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,479
and it went back to the cellular level

880
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,159
well if you do that and you get it down

881
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,319
to the one cell now you can make your

882
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,559
crispr changes on that one cell

883
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,879
but you have to grow it back out into a

884
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,798
full plant that is re-differentiated

885
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,640
into the proper types

886
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,038
okay and that doesn't just happen

887
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,600
spontaneously like you have to

888
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,440
there's protocols with different

889
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,959
chemical and hormonal applications that

890
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,919
you have to get that you have to go

891
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,679
through

892
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,799
to

893
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,919
redifferentiate a stem cell it's like

894
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,519
you know it's like if you want to take a

895
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,120
stem cell from someone

896
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,798
you take skeleton cells out of their

897
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,558
skin

898
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,240
you you put them through a genetic

899
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,079
program and it makes them back into a

900
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
stem cell now it's like

901
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,319
the progenitor cell that can can become

902
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,880
heart tissue or eye tissue or lung

903
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,519
tissue and so depending on what you want

904
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,080
that cell to do in the end you have to

905
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,000
coax it along that genetic pathway so

906
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,278
your little baby stem cell grows up to

907
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,960
be a heart cell

908
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,119
right and then you can take those heart

909
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,519
cells and

910
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,199
coat them on some kind of like matrix so

911
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,720
that they grow into a piece of tissue

912
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,960
that you can actually transplant into a

913
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,880
heart for example

914
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,000
you don't want to put lung cells into a

915
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,159
heart

916
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,599
right and so there's a whole science

917
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,880
that nobody has figured out to my

918
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,079
understanding that nobody's figured out

919
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,399
in cannabis

920
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,158
to really go through that process of

921
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,119
single cells to

922
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,559
differentiated tissue secondly when they

923
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,079
go through that process of

924
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,599
redifferentiation there's something

925
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,119
called soma clonal variation

926
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,278
and again you can look that up it's

927
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,398
somaclonal

928
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,159
soma and then the word clonal variation

929
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,639
and that's

930
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,000
genetic variation or epigenetic

931
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,960
variation

932
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,278
that stands upon the genotype

933
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,278
um

934
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,359
and that can actually che through

935
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,319
something called dna methylation that

936
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,038
can

937
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,200
either silence genes or

938
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,440
over expressed genes

939
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,880
and the result of those things may be

940
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,038
that the plant that actually comes out

941
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,720
of that form of tissue culture is not

942
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,319
the same as the one that went in

943
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,000
regardless of the genetic change that

944
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,439
you made

945
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,759
right so

946
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,038
i think that for now

947
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,319
listen it's going to happen at some

948
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:07,679
point in time

949
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,000
somebody will make

950
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:14,880
you know crisper cannabis it hasn't i

951
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,480
don't believe it's happened yet um

952
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,120
typically you make those kinds of

953
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,159
alterations in in

954
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,839
species that that are already id are

955
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
mostly ideal but you just want to fix

956
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,759
one trait

957
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
and

958
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,599
there isn't the natural genetic

959
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,200
diversity that is present in the species

960
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,199
for you to be able to go back and select

961
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,319
those traits through breeding

962
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,640
um

963
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,798
it's a it's a it's a shortcut it's a

964
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,320
really cool technique it's super neat

965
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,119
that we can that we're at the point in

966
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,798
time that we can do that now but i don't

967
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,719
think that anybody has to worry that

968
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,759
that's happening with cannabis at the

969
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,000
moment

970
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,398
right it will come one day but i don't

971
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,119
think that we're there yet

972
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,959
yeah what a really comprehensive answer

973
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,959
so if we jump to the other end of the

974
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,000
spectrum you know as a as opposed to

975
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
maybe the

976
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,558
the quote experts using genetic

977
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,840
modification let's talk about the novice

978
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,839
for a second

979
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,558
what would be your advice to someone

980
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,879
just starting out on the right way to

981
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,480
breed what would be any tips or sort of

982
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,840
principles you would recommend they

983
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,919
adhere to

984
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,000
genetics for dummies and get yourself a

985
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,080
genetics for dummies textbook

986
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
understand a basic plant breeding

987
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,439
textbook or even a basic biology

988
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,519
textbook that

989
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,480
teaches meiosis

990
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,679
um meiosis is the dance of life that

991
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,519
goes on

992
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,759
like i said earlier in the forming of

993
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,558
the cells that become sperm pollen eggs

994
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,000
and

995
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,038
you know um ovules and plants

996
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,759
and

997
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,919
that genetic dance

998
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,359
is more important to the breeding

999
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,600
process than anything else because if

1000
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,359
you understand how it happens then you

1001
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,519
understand what's possible and what's

1002
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,678
not possible

1003
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,759
once you have that knowledge you can add

1004
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,120
on cannabis knowledge on top of it and

1005
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,720
you only become

1006
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,719
more informed

1007
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,759
but

1008
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,559
the vast majority of books

1009
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,079
on cannabis don't do an adequate job of

1010
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,358
talking about it

1011
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,240
um

1012
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,000
rob clark's book is not bad for it it's

1013
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,078
it's a pretty good start you have to

1014
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,039
remember the context and i say it's not

1015
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,800
bad it's an epic book but i say it's not

1016
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,039
bad today because it's 2020 and that

1017
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,679
book was written 39 years ago it was

1018
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,800
published in in 1981.

1019
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,838
um

1020
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,119
so

1021
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,000
the amount of things that we've learned

1022
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,200
about science since then is pretty fast

1023
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,639
and a lot of those things are kind of

1024
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,799
left out of the book

1025
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,639
um so i don't you know i don't talk bad

1026
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,480
about rob's book because it's it fails

1027
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,559
because it's it's not a good book it's a

1028
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,719
great book it's just it's got a lot of

1029
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,480
science from you know that time period

1030
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,799
and our perspective on breeding from

1031
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,159
that time period

1032
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,320
um

1033
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,320
so yeah start off with basic plant

1034
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,680
breeding do yourself a favor just read

1035
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,039
you know the first 10 chapters of a

1036
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,639
plant breeding book

1037
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,119
then go and start really digging into

1038
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,440
cannabis and i guarantee you that it

1039
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,559
will make your cannabis breeding that

1040
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,800
much better because you'll understand

1041
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,559
how you can do things what you can do

1042
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,000
and what you can't do

1043
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,759
and those are important things to know i

1044
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,679
mean you have to know

1045
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,599
you know

1046
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,519
plant breeding is about getting from

1047
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,000
point a to point b

1048
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,280
you have to understand where you are at

1049
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,159
point a

1050
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,519
and know where you're going to point b

1051
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,319
you don't just get in the car and start

1052
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,358
slamming the gas down right and and

1053
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,640
close your eyes and hope that you're

1054
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:35,920
going to get to your destination and

1055
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,759
that's kind of the way that we've been

1056
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,000
breeding cannabis

1057
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,560
um if that if you can

1058
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,639
take that as an algae

1059
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,559
sure a really good answer as well i

1060
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,799
think probably do everyone even myself

1061
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,639
good to brush up on that sort of thing

1062
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,519
so the next question is we commonly hear

1063
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,838
people discuss this idea about how

1064
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,880
breeders of years gone by maybe people

1065
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,880
working in the 90s or even earlier

1066
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,280
it was it's commonly discussed that like

1067
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,440
they just had such good stock to work

1068
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,040
with but then on the counter end of that

1069
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,119
argument you hear that well maybe they

1070
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,199
were just better breeders so to speak

1071
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,960
but part of me thinks that's well there

1072
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,960
wasn't as many breeders back then so it

1073
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,639
would be weird that like there was such

1074
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,159
a high number of breeders that

1075
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,480
historically have been considered to

1076
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,679
have done some pretty good work what's

1077
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,320
your thoughts do you think that the

1078
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,799
stock was better or that there was some

1079
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,400
interplay of skill involved

1080
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
no i don't think either of those things

1081
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,079
i mean there's good plant breeders then

1082
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,679
there's good plant breeders now

1083
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,760
i think the stock that people were

1084
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,279
working with back then was probably less

1085
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,800
refined

1086
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,880
not better

1087
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,119
there was probably more dogs in any

1088
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,680
family any seed population that you

1089
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,880
you'd grow there's probably more subpar

1090
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,078
plants than there are today

1091
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,838
because again the people that are

1092
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,800
breeding today they get to benefit from

1093
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,519
all the good

1094
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,359
choices that people made in the past

1095
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,880
and in the past i mean it depends on how

1096
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,400
far back you go but i mean we're talking

1097
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,280
like 70s

1098
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,200
you know

1099
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,359
at that point in time people were really

1100
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,759
using

1101
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,838
um

1102
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
what i would call like more close to

1103
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,679
land race or indigenous or region of

1104
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,359
origin populations

1105
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,719
and like i said before

1106
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,559
those types of

1107
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,118
of genetic material that type of genetic

1108
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,400
material is usually quite it's a lot

1109
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,800
less refined

1110
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,119
and so you have a lot of of

1111
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,280
a lot more less desirable traits in

1112
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,640
those populations so things like

1113
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,240
intersex you were talking about you know

1114
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,759
for example thai ever a lot of people

1115
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,319
know that tai has got

1116
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,839
intersex plants and you know david i

1117
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,200
spoke a lot with david about tai because

1118
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,559
he's probably done more thai breeding

1119
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,399
than anyone i know he used to go there

1120
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,960
and collect seeds and then bring them

1121
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,838
back and do a lot of work and

1122
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
you know

1123
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,719
he said that like that 95 of them were

1124
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,240
just trash

1125
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:56,000
right tall weak potency intersex

1126
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,759
and you know so if you're growing like a

1127
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,679
few thousand thai plants

1128
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,760
and you're only going to find

1129
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,480
you know less than 100 that are even

1130
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,400
potential candidates that's not that's a

1131
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,440
lot of work for

1132
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,000
um not a lot of reward also thai doesn't

1133
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,639
yield anything like it's a tiny little

1134
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,920
sparse plant so if you grew 2000 plants

1135
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,519
and you're not yielding very much that's

1136
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,079
also not a very good

1137
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,239
use of your resources right so there's a

1138
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,160
reason that we don't grow those plants

1139
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,838
anymore and i know that there's

1140
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,679
specialists that like to go back and

1141
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,440
haul small home growers

1142
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,118
and i think that that's fantastic like i

1143
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,400
think it's great that people are growing

1144
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,838
those things and still playing with

1145
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,960
those plants because

1146
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:36,480
even if you're just crossing and

1147
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,159
stumbling around like the chances are

1148
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,440
you might you might stump there's a

1149
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,519
possibility at least that you might

1150
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,800
stumble into something good

1151
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,679
um

1152
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,079
but i think from seriously going to work

1153
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,000
a line like that really

1154
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,160
you know it's nice because thailand's

1155
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,358
just about to legalize medical cannabis

1156
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,759
and it's like you really want to go back

1157
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:59,598
to thailand and grow

1158
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,200
200 300 000 plants looking for the one

1159
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,920
right um

1160
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,799
and and so when i talk about cannabis

1161
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,358
you know and genetic resources it's like

1162
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,119
we have some painful

1163
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,759
steps that we have to do through those

1164
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,960
processes but

1165
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,520
that you know that would be a terrible

1166
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,000
thing to have to do grow like 20 acres

1167
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,280
of plants just to find the one

1168
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,400
because they're not going to yield

1169
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,680
anything so from a commercial

1170
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
perspective it's kind of like how do you

1171
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,639
convince your investors that's a good

1172
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,960
idea

1173
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,639
but if somebody does it and they do find

1174
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,720
the one plant that is

1175
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,639
just epic for whatever reason for

1176
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,358
whatever set of trades

1177
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,039
then yeah like at that point in time

1178
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,440
we move forward from that new starting

1179
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,279
point and then things get better

1180
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,440
right and corn apparently i have some

1181
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,800
corn breeder friends too and they they

1182
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,159
tell me that corn kind of went through

1183
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,800
the same thing like there was a lot of

1184
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,239
times where there was a lot of crosses

1185
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,920
with all these different

1186
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,679
corn varieties

1187
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,680
and again the vast majority of them were

1188
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,358
dogs they were just terrible populations

1189
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,838
they were they didn't taste good they

1190
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,719
didn't yield well they didn't have good

1191
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,480
mold resistance or you know

1192
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,358
crop protection traits all that kind of

1193
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,760
stuff

1194
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:12,799
but once you once you go through the

1195
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,480
hard part of purging all those negative

1196
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,480
traits out of the population

1197
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,319
you're actually you you end up at a

1198
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,599
starting place that's much better than

1199
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,519
where we are

1200
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,359
and once we get there we'll be able to

1201
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,800
turn cannabis into that type of crop

1202
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,119
like we were talking about with corn

1203
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,400
where you can plant seeds and they all

1204
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,079
come up looking

1205
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,119
you know i call them bulletproof plants

1206
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,160
they come up

1207
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,680
they're perfect they got the perfect

1208
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,078
chemistry they got the great yield

1209
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,759
they've got all the proper resistances

1210
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,480
they're all uniform you know everything

1211
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,119
that a a true crop producer could want

1212
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,760
right like i think that's really

1213
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,039
what a plant breeder's goal should be

1214
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,079
aside from the discovery and right now

1215
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,358
you know we sell

1216
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,200
breeders

1217
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,318
typically in the cannabis market sell

1218
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,279
the variation as a

1219
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:04,639
um

1220
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,640
a feature not a flaw

1221
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,318
do you know what i mean like it's not

1222
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,399
really like if you're growing crops

1223
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:11,519
and you're a you're a farmer you want to

1224
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,720
plant all the seeds and they come up

1225
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,318
looking the same if you plant

1226
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,879
a thousand seeds and all the plants are

1227
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,318
different you're not gonna be very happy

1228
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,800
right because then you got to go and do

1229
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,639
all that phenotypic selection and you're

1230
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,400
you don't you lose all the uniformity in

1231
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,078
your crop which is a pain in the ass for

1232
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,240
many many reasons from harvesting to

1233
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,480
marketing to everything

1234
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,479
um

1235
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,760
and so we got to get to that point in

1236
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,358
time where we've actually bred the

1237
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,200
plants to be

1238
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,279
reliable

1239
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,639
seeds so that you can plant a crop and

1240
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,079
and the farmer can know that what is on

1241
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,039
advertising the description is going to

1242
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,079
come up in the field

1243
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,480
yeah

1244
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,280
really valid point there and some kind

1245
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,000
of often under considered um kind of

1246
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,160
points you raised there

1247
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,880
it's it's a shame but it's just part of

1248
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,399
this evolution and you know

1249
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,680
like everybody wants to be a breeder

1250
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,480
it's like a lot of people think that

1251
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,639
like

1252
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,000
okay i'm i've been growing five years so

1253
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,000
now i'm a breeder and it's like no

1254
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,079
you're not it's a totally different set

1255
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,880
of skills yeah you got to be a grower to

1256
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,240
be able to to appreciate the minutia of

1257
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,559
the characteristics of the plant and

1258
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,679
look and understand what you're seeing

1259
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,599
but really if you want to be a breeder

1260
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,879
go learn how to be a breeder it's not

1261
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,359
hard

1262
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,880
right it just takes time and and it's a

1263
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,119
set of heuristics that you have to

1264
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,880
understand and methodologies that you

1265
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,039
have to understand it's not difficult

1266
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,599
stuff to grasp it's not like

1267
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,440
you have to be some super special crazy

1268
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,440
person to do it you don't

1269
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,880
but you do have to put in the time you

1270
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,559
know just like you don't pick up a

1271
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,160
guitar and then like start touring with

1272
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,759
metallica

1273
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,159
right

1274
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,800
yeah very good analogy and i mean on the

1275
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,039
point of being a good breeder a question

1276
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,240
i always like to ask the guests

1277
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:02,480
what are some if any attributes you look

1278
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,439
for in a male that you think are a sign

1279
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,800
of quality or will help with the project

1280
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,480
well i'm going to flip it back right to

1281
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,039
the same thing i said before about males

1282
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,119
i think males are a detriment to

1283
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,719
breeding drug cannabis because they

1284
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,160
don't match the morphology and the

1285
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:20,799
chemistry

1286
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,799
um that the female plants use so

1287
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:26,239
you know i am really doing a lot more

1288
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,000
work these days on i'll do preservation

1289
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,598
run if i have a population and i do a

1290
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,039
preservation i'll open pollinate it

1291
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,720
using the males

1292
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,880
and then i select my females from once

1293
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,239
i've open pollinated the males i know

1294
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,079
that i've got all the genes from the

1295
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,358
plants right from the entire population

1296
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,359
you cross all the males to all the

1297
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,880
females you that's that's what's called

1298
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,199
an open pollination

1299
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,720
and all the genetic diversity is then

1300
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,719
preserved that goes in the freezer or

1301
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,039
the fridge

1302
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,078
then you take your females and you start

1303
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:53,440
selecting

1304
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,680
like i said for

1305
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,960
traits of interest on any given size of

1306
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,480
the cross so

1307
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,679
you know you ask me what are important

1308
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,880
traits i'm going to put it back to you

1309
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,078
and say what are important traits for

1310
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,119
you right

1311
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,280
you know

1312
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,640
flavor yield potency

1313
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,160
or i'm not going to say potency but can

1314
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:09,440
have my profiles because you might be

1315
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:12,239
selecting for

1316
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,838
you know thcv and against thc it's not

1317
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,919
all about the drug

1318
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:16,799
or at least the thc the recreational

1319
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,720
drug

1320
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,280
there's all these other compounds

1321
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,919
that are really have important potential

1322
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,680
medical uses and so

1323
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,358
if you identify that compound in two

1324
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,799
female plants you cross them together

1325
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,598
and now you've got a population that's

1326
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,599
more likely to have that trait in it

1327
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,318
and then you can start adding in

1328
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,440
you know stature or morphology or plant

1329
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,440
architecture or

1330
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:45,280
flavor or color or you know cannabinoid

1331
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,440
profile or whatever it is

1332
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,560
resistance to powdery mildew resistance

1333
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,800
to molds resistance to pests like

1334
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,719
all of those types of traits especially

1335
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,160
the last three

1336
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,358
they're impossible to breed for in

1337
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,879
closets you just can't do it

1338
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,119
you have to be grown on a field with

1339
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,240
disease pressure and selecting plants in

1340
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,318
the environment that you're going to be

1341
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,159
growing them and i think that those

1342
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,800
kinds of traits like the things that are

1343
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:13,598
really important to growers

1344
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,800
have kind of been left out of

1345
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,280
um

1346
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,880
the agendas of plant breeders because

1347
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,800
let's face it everybody's been chasing

1348
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,800
flavor and potency

1349
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,240
right really above everything else and i

1350
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,160
think even you look at the basic

1351
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,239
architecture of of some of these the

1352
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,318
plant the plant architecture i call it

1353
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,559
or the stature or the or the structural

1354
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:33,759
morphology of the plant you look at some

1355
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,000
of these new hybrids coming out of

1356
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,400
california and their statures are

1357
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
terrible right like these plants you

1358
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,440
have to support them you got to stake

1359
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,880
them you got to grow them in nets

1360
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,720
because they can't support themselves

1361
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,640
with the weight of the flower the stems

1362
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,480
are all tiny little thin

1363
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,159
things that you you put them in a room

1364
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
with any kind of powdery mildew issue or

1365
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,679
greenhouse and they're they're turning

1366
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,280
the powdery mildew and mold

1367
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:01,039
so all those traits that have been

1368
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,640
ignored like we really need to start

1369
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:07,679
breeding for those things because

1370
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,879
again from an industry there's two sides

1371
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:10,799
and i call them

1372
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,200
i look at them as competing interests

1373
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,800
but it's i call them growers plants and

1374
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,318
smokers plants

1375
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,800
right the plant the plants that the

1376
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,400
grower wants to grow are typically not

1377
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,359
the plants that the smokers want to

1378
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,960
smoke

1379
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,078
right because the they've kind of got

1380
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,480
competing in

1381
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,800
interest the grower wants the big one

1382
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,480
that's bulletproof you know it's it's

1383
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,839
mold resistant it's powdery mildew

1384
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,599
resistant it can

1385
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,199
it doesn't matter if mites bite it like

1386
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,800
it just keeps going it's got these big

1387
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,719
thick leaves or whatever the traits are

1388
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,240
to keep the mites at bay and the same

1389
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,519
with like root aphids or anything i mean

1390
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,159
we could be talking about any part of

1391
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,119
the plant here

1392
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,879
but

1393
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,480
that's really what as a breeder you need

1394
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,000
to deliver a plant because they're your

1395
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,838
customer the customer is not your

1396
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,599
customer is not the smoker your customer

1397
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,880
is a seed

1398
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:59,440
purveyor is the grower right and so you

1399
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,200
need to be serving his agenda

1400
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,280
but

1401
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,719
also his agenda is to have a marketable

1402
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,560
product that he can sell on the market

1403
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,639
if you give him a bulletproof plant that

1404
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,039
sucks to smoke you're not really also

1405
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,078
not doing any flavors right

1406
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,759
so

1407
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,000
it's really about

1408
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,880
balancing the wishes the goals and the

1409
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,960
growers versus the goals of the smokers

1410
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,119
and ideally you can create a plant that

1411
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,679
caters to both that's a lot of work and

1412
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,920
i don't think that there's

1413
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,838
any plant breeders on the planet really

1414
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,440
with cannabis that are at that point yet

1415
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,119
where we've got

1416
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,960
plants that do both

1417
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,559
you know um

1418
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,400
again prohibition has kicked us in the

1419
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,759
teeth of the last 40 years 50 years we

1420
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,599
haven't been able to make any any

1421
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,000
progress 60 years right we haven't

1422
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,359
really if you look at the genetic

1423
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,920
progress that

1424
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,960
crops like wheat and corn have undergone

1425
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,599
in the past 60 years

1426
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,679
their lights they're light years ahead

1427
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,800
of where we are

1428
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,078
because we just haven't had we've been

1429
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,160
kept out of the system they wouldn't let

1430
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,519
us play in the game right

1431
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,519
every time he tried to set up a row the

1432
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,318
cops would show up so

1433
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,358
in the un's un's in the united states

1434
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,199
are running around the world paying

1435
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,119
people to cut down the other weed it's

1436
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,078
it's been a pretty hard time for

1437
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,720
cannabis for the last 60 years

1438
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,280
yeah undeniably so

1439
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,439
i think the next question admittedly is

1440
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,359
one of those ones where it's like a kind

1441
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,920
of like a how long is a bit of string

1442
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:28,799
question but a lot of growers and

1443
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,880
breeders often ask the question

1444
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,599
what is sort of the minimum number of

1445
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,760
seeds you'd want to run through to feel

1446
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,160
like you had a reasonably good idea of

1447
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,920
what was in the gene pool so to speak

1448
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:40,960
and so i'd love to hear your thoughts on

1449
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,559
that

1450
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,559
well it depends on the number of cheats

1451
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,839
that traits that you're tr you're

1452
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,200
chasing

1453
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,838
we would when we would do a cross down

1454
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:52,318
in california the minimum we had these

1455
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,639
uh nursery trays that are called 72 cell

1456
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:58,318
nursery trays it fits in a 10 inch by 20

1457
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:59,920
inch standard nursery tray and it has

1458
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:01,599
72 cells

1459
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,920
and we would start those and that's

1460
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,519
enough to get a good

1461
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,800
excuse me a good initial look at the

1462
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,960
population

1463
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,400
and depending on what you see in that

1464
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,480
you might find an incredible plant you

1465
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,079
might even find a plant that's a breeder

1466
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,358
you might realize that the population

1467
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,480
sucks or you might decide let's grow

1468
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:20,078
another

1469
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,838
10 times what we grew or another five

1470
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,000
times what we grew

1471
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,599
right but i i kind of feel like

1472
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
you know i'd like to do more but just

1473
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,240
because of

1474
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
this is like a good size for starting

1475
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,838
you know it was like it was an easy

1476
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,039
thing to put in our inner production

1477
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,599
system

1478
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,519
um so it's not ideal but it's it's a

1479
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,119
pretty good idea to get a good idea you

1480
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,960
got to remember also

1481
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,880
most people are breeding from like three

1482
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,480
five or 10 seeds not 100 or 72 or you

1483
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,200
know 500

1484
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,760
so 72 is a lot better than we've done in

1485
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,159
the past that does doesn't mean it's

1486
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,760
close to ideal but it's it's all about

1487
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,039
being able to

1488
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,119
move your project forward

1489
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,318
and balancing with

1490
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,640
you know the resources that you have

1491
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:07,838
available right it costs money to grow

1492
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:09,279
plants

1493
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,119
right it takes time there's an

1494
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,160
opportunity cost to growing plants

1495
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,280
because you could be growing other

1496
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,598
plants

1497
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,440
right and truthfully i got so many

1498
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,119
populations of seeds it's like i'm never

1499
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,159
going to get through them all

1500
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,519
right so

1501
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,039
um

1502
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,239
it's about prioritizing them and

1503
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,358
sometimes you make a cross and you're

1504
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,879
like well that was that was great and

1505
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,719
but now i need to grow the next

1506
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,079
generation of those plants and the stuff

1507
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,000
that's in your vault waiting to get

1508
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,839
sprouted you know you don't even have a

1509
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,519
chance to go back to it because

1510
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,759
every time you grow a new line you might

1511
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,440
add a new population or a new project to

1512
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,400
your goal

1513
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,920
your set of breeding goals so

1514
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,920
yeah

1515
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,159
72 was what we were doing it was a good

1516
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,000
start like i said

1517
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,318
yeah that seems like a pretty pretty

1518
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,199
nice number to start with for sure it's

1519
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,960
it's far dude it's far less less than is

1520
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,199
ideal like i'll tell you that off right

1521
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,358
off the bat i mean i'd want to grow a

1522
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,838
thousand if i could but

1523
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,679
a thousand plants sent to the lab at 50

1524
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,838
bucks a pop that's a thousand dollar

1525
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:10,639
bill

1526
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:11,759
right

1527
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,920
so

1528
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,440
it's probably worth more than the crops

1529
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,680
worth right so

1530
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,400
you know it's all about balancing

1531
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:23,118
your resources your space available and

1532
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,039
and your priorities and there's no magic

1533
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,519
numbers

1534
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:30,000
yeah yeah i understand

1535
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:32,800
so we've been alluding to it all episode

1536
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,119
but time to get into it some people may

1537
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,839
or may not be aware but you're involved

1538
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,480
in the first case of cannabis having a

1539
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,558
patent on it i'd love to hear how you

1540
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,719
got involved in this initially yeah well

1541
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,519
the first so

1542
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:49,118
the first they weren't the first

1543
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,239
patents involving cannabis they were the

1544
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,240
first utility patents involving plants

1545
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,919
and truthfully i had nothing to do with

1546
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,759
the patent side of it i worked for a

1547
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,358
research company and i did the plant

1548
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,000
breeding and the

1549
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:04,078
ip development and the patents

1550
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,880
came from

1551
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,559
more or less the lawyers of the group

1552
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,960
um there's certain things that i can

1553
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,400
talk about that i that's public this has

1554
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,838
been publicly disclosed and there's

1555
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,760
unfortunately stuff that i can't because

1556
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,279
i'm i was under contract with these

1557
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,280
folks and i signed a non-disclosure

1558
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,800
agreement but yeah there was patents

1559
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,359
done on work

1560
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,359
that i did on these plants and

1561
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:28,639
my name is not affiliated affiliated

1562
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:28,639
with those patents at all

1563
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,720
again

1564
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,400
people get really freaked out when you

1565
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,879
start talking about

1566
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,559
patenting plants

1567
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,318
these weren't

1568
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:45,440
patents on a specific plant they were

1569
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:47,679
patents on the use of a specific plant

1570
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,440
it might seem like a like splitting

1571
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,960
hairs but it actually has a big

1572
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,599
difference

1573
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,800
plants plant patents per se like

1574
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,039
specific

1575
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,800
plant patents

1576
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,400
are only really valid in a couple of

1577
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,160
countries one being yours and the other

1578
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,000
one being the united states so australia

1579
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,759
and the united states are i think

1580
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
two of the only global

1581
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,000
um

1582
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,318
justice systems that are legal systems

1583
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,358
that actually recognize patents on

1584
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,079
plants

1585
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:18,799
in canada they don't recognize

1586
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,039
patents on higher organisms

1587
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,680
although you can patent the cell of a

1588
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:25,599
plant which is kind of bizarre so if

1589
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,039
somebody has a plant with that cell in

1590
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,280
it

1591
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,279
i guess you can in some way try to

1592
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,680
enforce intellectual property rights on

1593
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,000
them it's pretty difficult

1594
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,000
um

1595
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,959
everybody's heard the story about

1596
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,039
monsanto going after this poor organic

1597
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,318
farmer that grew seeds

1598
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,639
and his seeds were contaminated by

1599
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:51,039
monsanto the story that most people

1600
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,960
don't understand which is the truth

1601
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,119
was that this farmer

1602
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,760
planted his soybeans right beside

1603
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,160
monsanto's crop that was next door

1604
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,800
and he went and actively collected all

1605
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:05,199
the seeds from the plants

1606
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,519
right along the border

1607
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,519
and then grew those plants

1608
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,880
and subjected to them those those plants

1609
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,880
had a gene in them that caused a

1610
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,318
resistance to a chemical an agricultural

1611
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,559
chemical called

1612
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,800
glyphosate or roundup

1613
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,400
and roundup is a a herbicide it

1614
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,400
essentially kills plants that don't have

1615
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,400
this specific gene in them the gene came

1616
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,838
from a bacteria

1617
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,519
and then they put it into this plant and

1618
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,639
then once the plants had the gene they

1619
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:32,639
became resistant to this

1620
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:34,799
thing so percy schmeiser who was the

1621
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,719
farmer

1622
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,800
somehow the media really painted him as

1623
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,519
a bit of a hero this poor organic farmer

1624
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,440
against big old bad monsanto and don't

1625
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,759
get me wrong i have no love for monsanto

1626
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,159
but the truth of the matter was is that

1627
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,480
this guy actively went after

1628
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,159
using their genetic technology

1629
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,240
and he wasn't growing organically he

1630
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,598
exposed those all those seeds to this

1631
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,759
agrochemical

1632
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,400
and then in the process he essentially

1633
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,200
stole their ip he took the gene

1634
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,639
um and he went to court and he lost

1635
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,558
so

1636
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,639
but somehow in the media that became oh

1637
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,319
this poor organic farmer he's being

1638
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,159
bullied by the big guy and i think that

1639
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,639
that's probably a bit of a

1640
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:15,759
a narrative that was created because

1641
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,358
there's a certain segment of the

1642
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,079
population that's

1643
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,279
against genetic modifications and you

1644
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,359
know

1645
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,240
the way that we do genetic modifications

1646
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,239
now

1647
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,078
compared to the way that we did them

1648
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,318
20 30 years ago is really different

1649
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,640
we've become you know back then it was

1650
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:36,000
probably closer to like

1651
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:38,400
you know doing surgery with a with a a

1652
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,400
japanese sword rather than you know a

1653
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,599
scalpel

1654
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,280
um and nowadays we're very very skilled

1655
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,640
we have all these new technologies that

1656
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,519
allow us to

1657
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:51,598
go in and create specific changes to

1658
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:54,318
dna like like you're talking about

1659
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,920
heavenly with crispr

1660
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,679
and those things kind of are just by the

1661
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,720
way side

1662
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:00,558
so

1663
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,078
anyway i think just to clear it up i

1664
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,680
think you know there's a lot of people

1665
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,119
running around online saying that i was

1666
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:07,199
patenting all the world and i was trying

1667
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,960
to steal the whole world strains truth

1668
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,879
is i had nothing to do with it other

1669
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,639
than breeding the plants

1670
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,880
i don't my name's not on the patents i

1671
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,239
don't get any intellectual property

1672
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,160
rights from them i don't get any

1673
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,399
royalties from it i really have

1674
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,838
absolutely nothing to do with it and i

1675
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,920
don't work with that group anymore and i

1676
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,159
haven't for a number of years

1677
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,159
um

1678
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:31,759
so so yeah it's kind of a it's just kind

1679
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,838
of a funny thing

1680
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,599
i was really you know i started working

1681
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,838
with the group because

1682
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:41,039
they were quite patient focused and i

1683
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:44,239
had an opportunity to

1684
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:46,480
have someone build us our dream lab to

1685
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:48,959
really start screening uh large

1686
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,639
populations of cannabis in a way

1687
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,000
with like height what we call brute

1688
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:53,838
force

1689
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,679
um

1690
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,440
chemical breeding i mean it's it's like

1691
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:58,879
i said it's expensive to grow a lot of

1692
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,480
plants and then send every single one of

1693
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,240
them to the laboratory

1694
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,039
and have full

1695
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:04,719
you know

1696
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,199
full terpene

1697
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,598
and cannabinoid and we also looked at

1698
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,118
other chemicals as well that influence

1699
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,119
smell and flavor

1700
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,798
and

1701
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,960
it was a learning experience for me and

1702
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,480
i really enjoyed it like i really

1703
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,760
there were some good folks in the group

1704
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:27,159
and we created some really cool plants

1705
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,160
that had unique chemistry cbdv thcv

1706
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,078
you know cbd type 2 plants with altered

1707
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:34,318
cannabinoid ratios and really

1708
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,798
interesting terpene profiles

1709
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,318
and all that stuff was able to go to a

1710
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:40,960
series of dispensaries and companies

1711
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:43,039
that were growing it

1712
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,440
and it was really really a lot of fun

1713
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,798
and it was really gratifying to be able

1714
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,240
to create these

1715
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:49,920
you know these plants that we'd always

1716
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,558
talked about

1717
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,519
and deliver them to patients

1718
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,960
um

1719
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:58,559
there was a few people in the community

1720
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,720
that were pretty upset about the idea of

1721
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,680
cannabis patents being granted

1722
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,358
and they did a lot of effort to

1723
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,719
create a narrative where people thought

1724
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,400
that you know

1725
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,318
that we were trying to steal the world

1726
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,440
and nothing could be more further from

1727
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:12,719
the truth

1728
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,240
you know the only things that were

1729
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,558
patented were

1730
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:19,039
new unique combinations of cannabinoids

1731
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,000
that and terpenes that had that didn't

1732
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,759
exist before like they were new plants

1733
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,039
right they really were

1734
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,720
new

1735
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,719
inventions right

1736
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:30,639
um and when we did that i think that's

1737
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,719
the lawyers for the group we're like oh

1738
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,239
we need to protect these things and

1739
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,159
well i think that that's also a thing

1740
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,838
that you know people kind of want to say

1741
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,838
ah it's unfair that you can patent a

1742
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,920
plant or a life and that's like you're

1743
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:44,318
an organism that occurred in nature well

1744
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,159
dude these things didn't occur in nature

1745
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:48,000
right like these plants are not you're

1746
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,598
not going to go into any population and

1747
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,719
find a plant with this set of chemistry

1748
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,359
they just don't exist they're new

1749
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:57,519
and you don't spend

1750
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:58,318
many hundreds of thousands of dollars or

1751
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:00,639
more

1752
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:02,719
doing research into any kind of

1753
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,039
technology or plant or

1754
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:07,039
breeding program or you know you're

1755
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,960
designing a new computer or whatever it

1756
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,719
is it's like you don't design you don't

1757
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,159
spend money in research and development

1758
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,279
if

1759
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:14,798
the people that are paying for the

1760
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,880
research and development can't get a

1761
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,480
return on their investment right that's

1762
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,920
just the way it is

1763
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,920
um

1764
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,440
and patents aren't the only way that you

1765
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,440
like we said that you can get

1766
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,400
intellectual property rights on plants

1767
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,318
there's these

1768
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,400
things called pbrs or plant breeder

1769
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:31,519
rights registrations through upof which

1770
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,119
is the

1771
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:36,239
union for the protection of plant

1772
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,358
varieties which is a global organization

1773
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,039
like i said before it kind of oversees

1774
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,519
the intellectual property matters of

1775
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,838
plants right like if you if you spent 15

1776
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,358
years to make a new apple variety and

1777
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:49,599
it's let's just call it again granny

1778
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,119
smith or whatever

1779
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,200
you know you ha you should have the

1780
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,880
rights to reap the commercial rewards

1781
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:57,838
for a period of time

1782
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,119
and part of that system

1783
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:00,880
exists

1784
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,559
that yeah you get the commercial rights

1785
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,160
but you have to make the plant variety

1786
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,119
available to any other breeder in the

1787
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,279
world

1788
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,280
and they can take that variety and use

1789
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,640
your work to make something better

1790
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,640
right and

1791
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,879
and that better plant even though you

1792
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,798
have your commercial rights for 20 years

1793
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,119
or 15 years or whatever it is depending

1794
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,880
on the jurisdiction

1795
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,480
it might be in five years somebody's

1796
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,079
created a better variety of yours anyway

1797
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,880
than yours anyway

1798
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,400
uh using your work right and the reason

1799
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,000
it's set up like that is so that

1800
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,000
humanity benefits from

1801
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,239
you know it's a communal

1802
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:38,639
development where the whole world gets

1803
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,479
to benefit from a new technology yeah

1804
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,239
you might come up with new technology

1805
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,400
and you get some rights to a few years

1806
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,318
to use it but everybody else in the in

1807
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,760
the in the industry also gets to take it

1808
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,000
and then start using it in their own

1809
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,559
breeding programs and so it's kind of a

1810
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,639
trade-off um

1811
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,400
anyway it's it's a funny thing because

1812
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,078
you know i've had i've had death threats

1813
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,240
online about it

1814
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,920
right

1815
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,719
and it's just bizarre right because it's

1816
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,480
like

1817
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:06,159
it's like read the patent my name's not

1818
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,920
even on it like i really have nothing to

1819
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,519
do it i don't i don't get a penny from

1820
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,480
it and you're threatening my life

1821
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:12,559
because

1822
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,639
of some perceived

1823
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,240
notion that somebody took something from

1824
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,000
you which couldn't even be further from

1825
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,239
the truth it's like

1826
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,079
you know anyway it's just it's just

1827
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,399
weird it's just what it is but hey man

1828
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,000
that's uh

1829
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,760
you know part of the thing that's going

1830
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,599
on from

1831
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,200
this transition from the old world to

1832
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,838
the new world you know i've been doing

1833
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,118
this for a long time

1834
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:36,880
um

1835
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,000
i've been growing cannabis for 30 years

1836
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,280
and so

1837
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,400
you know i've worked with people all

1838
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,240
over the world and all these different

1839
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,599
really you know like like i said

1840
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:44,399
we've all the people that we've talked

1841
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,760
about

1842
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,680
these people are all colleagues and

1843
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,640
friends of mine right

1844
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:50,480
and so

1845
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,078
when when you get new people in the

1846
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,440
industry that come in and they've been

1847
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,519
around for two years and they're

1848
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,280
accusing you of stealing from the

1849
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:00,079
community

1850
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,400
it's kind of like go [ __ ] yourself

1851
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,440
you know it's like you're johnny come

1852
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,119
lately

1853
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,318
i've dedicated my life to this kind of

1854
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,240
work and you're telling me that i'm

1855
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,480
stealing from you like give me a break

1856
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:13,118
it's ridiculous

1857
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,358
um and truthfully the reason that we did

1858
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:18,240
the work is so that we we could provide

1859
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:19,519
these new types of medicine to patients

1860
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:21,199
so

1861
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,239
i don't i don't feel bad about it you

1862
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:23,279
know

1863
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,719
um

1864
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,040
i don't know if i would seek patents

1865
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:29,039
myself on plants but again it doesn't

1866
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,079
apply in my market because because in

1867
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,000
canada

1868
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,680
that's not how you seek intellectual

1869
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,119
property protection

1870
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,358
it is one way you can do it in the

1871
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,559
states and you can do it in australia

1872
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:41,519
but um

1873
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,119
it's not something that interests me

1874
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,039
so

1875
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,798
yeah no what a what a comprehensive

1876
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,199
answer to a question i think a lot of

1877
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:52,239
people have been interested in hearing

1878
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,399
the backstory behind another

1879
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,479
similar question you hear discussed in

1880
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,240
that same vein which

1881
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,798
i've always been interested in but quite

1882
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:02,479
skeptical of the truth behind it is you

1883
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:06,318
hear people discuss this idea that if

1884
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:08,159
someone were to be able to say obtain a

1885
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:09,039
pattern right or some sort of patent

1886
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,440
over

1887
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,639
a very primordial sort of cannabis

1888
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,559
genetics which i don't even know if

1889
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,440
that's possible that they could then

1890
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,440
like pull the plug on anyone growing a

1891
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,119
distant descendant of that so to give it

1892
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,358
some context like if somehow i got a

1893
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,760
pattern for the original northern lights

1894
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:27,358
the fear is that like i could claim

1895
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,960
infringement on anyone who's growing

1896
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,920
anything with like northern lights in

1897
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,519
the genetics do you think that's that's

1898
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,119
that's not true anybody that says that

1899
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,880
doesn't understand how patents work and

1900
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,838
patent and intellectual property rights

1901
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,798
work

1902
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:40,558
um

1903
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,239
when you get a plant patent in the

1904
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,280
states or australia

1905
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:46,078
you get

1906
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,319
the rights to that one clone that one

1907
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,039
specific genotype and it has to be very

1908
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:53,119
described and usually they've done a dna

1909
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,559
fingerprint profile if somebody else

1910
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,079
takes that plant and cross it to

1911
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,960
something else

1912
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,720
it's it's gone it's out in the open

1913
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,079
right you still can't grow their one

1914
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:04,159
plant that's registered but you can make

1915
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,200
a hybrid of it and grow that

1916
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,279
so

1917
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:09,038
it's kind of a like this idea that

1918
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,839
somebody's patenting primary the other

1919
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,680
thing about patenting

1920
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,719
varieties if you want to call them that

1921
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:19,358
it's actually a great little term

1922
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:21,919
is that you can't patent anything like

1923
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:24,239
one of the key criteria for for getting

1924
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,318
a patent granted is that your patent

1925
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,719
your invention this is what a patent is

1926
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:30,960
as a protection on an invention your

1927
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:32,399
invention has to be novel and that just

1928
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,000
means new

1929
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,680
right so you actually have to have

1930
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,838
something that's new

1931
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,679
you can't come along and like

1932
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:42,239
take something from the market and

1933
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,919
patent it that doesn't work right they

1934
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,439
would never they'd never grant the

1935
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,400
patent and even if they did grant the

1936
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,240
patent

1937
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,599
right the pate

1938
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:51,279
patent is just really a piece of paper

1939
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,119
that says i own this thing right i got i

1940
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,240
got this patent now on this thing well

1941
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,519
someone can say i'm going to challenge

1942
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:56,879
your patent so they can take you to

1943
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:58,719
court

1944
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,039
right and then there's a court case and

1945
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:03,118
the whole process that goes on about

1946
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:06,319
deciding who actually owns the patent

1947
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,480
and so if if you're granted a patent

1948
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,798
on a plant

1949
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,798
and somebody else says

1950
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,199
oh hey i've got the same plant or

1951
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:15,199
whatever

1952
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:20,159
you you have to sue the person that's

1953
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,159
violating your rights right so it's

1954
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,000
actually a defensive strategy like if

1955
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:25,279
you own the patent you're not the one

1956
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,440
getting sued you're the one that's doing

1957
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,798
the suing but when you start suing

1958
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,200
somebody

1959
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,679
it could be ruled that your patents

1960
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:35,598
invalid

1961
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,679
right so it has to be worth your while

1962
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:40,079
to go after someone right it really has

1963
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:41,838
to be affecting your bottom line

1964
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,839
right because you always open up

1965
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:45,759
yourself to the chance that the court

1966
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,239
rules in the other person's favor and

1967
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,119
you lose your patent rights

1968
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,598
right so

1969
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,358
a patent is not like an impenetrable

1970
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,480
bulletproof vest

1971
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,480
it's a stake in the ground

1972
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,000
like you know when people stake mining

1973
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,599
sites right it's like you're planting a

1974
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,519
flag in the ground and saying this space

1975
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,119
is mine

1976
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,000
right and really

1977
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:12,079
whether that space is yours

1978
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,679
is really can be a matter for the courts

1979
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,400
right it doesn't necessarily mean that

1980
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:18,078
your claim is true

1981
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,160
it just means that you got it by the guy

1982
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,599
that says yeah that seems like a legit

1983
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:23,358
claim

1984
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,838
right so

1985
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,400
take that for what it's worth

1986
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:30,078
yeah i had a sneaking suspicion that

1987
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,559
that might be the case so that that's

1988
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:35,680
good to hear your input on that one i

1989
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,359
think we've got some kind of more less

1990
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:39,358
technical questions as we're kind of on

1991
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:41,199
the tail end of things so i'm interested

1992
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:42,318
to hear the answers to some of these but

1993
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,078
one that's

1994
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:45,679
came up a few times from our guest when

1995
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,519
i put the call out if anyone had any

1996
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,598
questions how did you get the name

1997
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:52,400
chimera

1998
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:55,039
i just chose it i mean it was i was

1999
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,519
studying dna at the time in genetics and

2000
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,680
a chimera it's actually a funny question

2001
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,679
because years after i kind of chose the

2002
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:05,598
name i actually became a

2003
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:07,118
chimera through surgery a chimera is a

2004
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,599
it means different things in greek

2005
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,358
mythology it was a mythical beast that

2006
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:14,559
was a lion

2007
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:16,719
with the tail of the lion was a serpent

2008
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,160
and there was a like a goat head or two

2009
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,318
goat heads growing out of the back of

2010
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,679
the animal and so really it was this

2011
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:24,079
scary

2012
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,679
mythical beast that was composed of

2013
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,160
three different monsters really is what

2014
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:31,118
it was supposed to be

2015
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:33,920
um but in in dna in the dna world a

2016
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,358
chimera is

2017
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,000
something that has

2018
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:40,078
dna from two different organisms okay so

2019
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,760
any different tissue like if for example

2020
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,839
if someone had a heart

2021
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,520
transplant they got a heart from

2022
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:47,199
somebody else they'd become a chimera

2023
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:50,400
because now they had

2024
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:52,159
an organ of a different type of dna

2025
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,160
growing within their body right which

2026
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:54,960
satisfy the condition of what a chimera

2027
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:57,920
is

2028
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,920
for me the word i kind of felt like the

2029
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,880
word was like

2030
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,880
a um

2031
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:07,280
it was

2032
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,599
it it to me what it meant was a

2033
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,319
combination a fusion of science and

2034
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,000
cannabis which back then at the time was

2035
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:15,519
completely unheard of right like i

2036
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,279
didn't know anybody in my cannabis

2037
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,119
community that was into science they

2038
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,640
just didn't care

2039
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:22,399
and i was so interested in nerding out

2040
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,838
about the plant and chemical analysis

2041
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:29,039
and the genetics of it um that to me it

2042
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:30,318
was more of a symbol for the fusion of

2043
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,158
understanding of science and

2044
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,440
understanding of chemistry

2045
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:37,278
and i didn't ever intend for it to be

2046
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:39,599
a name that stuck it was just a name

2047
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,719
that i chose to register on an internet

2048
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,480
web board at one point in time right

2049
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,520
um

2050
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:49,198
and so it's stuck and i never you know i

2051
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,560
i never changed my name on the internet

2052
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,318
i didn't

2053
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,759
i always was the type of person that

2054
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,520
kind of i would just say what i wanted

2055
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,679
to and if you didn't like what i was

2056
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,279
saying well too bad but i'm not gonna

2057
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,880
say something and then change my

2058
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,520
identity so that i don't have to have

2059
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,880
the consequences of what i said right

2060
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,199
um

2061
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,960
to me my word means something and so i

2062
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:11,519
always just kept the same name over like

2063
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,679
it's been you know a long time now or 25

2064
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,319
years at least on the internet

2065
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,960
which is bizarre to even consider that's

2066
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,400
true but um

2067
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,399
yeah so that's what it meant to me and

2068
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,000
then later on i had i developed a

2069
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:26,879
condition called keratoconus and i had

2070
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,798
to have two uh cornea transplants

2071
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,600
and so i've got

2072
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:33,519
corneas from two different people so i

2073
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,600
actually see the world through

2074
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,440
the eyes of two people that have left

2075
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,480
this world

2076
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,079
um

2077
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:45,039
becoming a chimera funnily enough

2078
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:46,479
yeah wow what a real life sort of twist

2079
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:48,880
to the name

2080
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,238
yeah it was bizarre

2081
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,239
i didn't even realize it until it

2082
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,879
happened and then i was like hey i guess

2083
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:56,559
i'm a chimera now

2084
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,840
there you go so

2085
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:02,080
the next question we had was

2086
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,840
how do you store your seeds what's your

2087
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:06,640
what's your method for long-term

2088
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,480
germination viability

2089
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,199
uh mostly just the fridge four degrees

2090
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:12,959
celsius and a very expensive scientific

2091
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,479
incubator that i bought at an auction

2092
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,719
for a song

2093
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:20,158
um

2094
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:22,480
and that suits me very very well um

2095
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:24,399
again taking cues from i actually came

2096
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,959
up with my i decided to put them at four

2097
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:28,960
degrees celsius because

2098
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,520
there was all this discussion on whether

2099
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,760
freezing cycles damage the seed

2100
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,760
and i you know

2101
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,199
i i figured getting the closest possible

2102
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,280
to freezing without actually freezing

2103
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,759
was probably best for these things

2104
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,880
water's densest point is at four degrees

2105
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,159
celsius

2106
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:48,400
and so to me that seemed like

2107
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:50,719
the optimum point to be storing seeds

2108
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,920
and and later when i you know

2109
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,719
started spending a lot more time with

2110
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,239
david and we kind of you know we

2111
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,000
once we became good friends we kind of

2112
01:10:56,238 --> 01:10:59,439
just opened the doors to each other's

2113
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,119
not knowledge like it's like i taught

2114
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:03,119
him everything i know and he taught me

2115
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,479
everything he knew

2116
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,719
and we just kind of had this open

2117
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:08,079
exchange of ideas and and sharing

2118
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,760
techniques and stuff and he's been

2119
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,679
actually storing seeds and under the

2120
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,480
exact same conditions

2121
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,560
for

2122
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:16,639
over 25 years

2123
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,880
and when we were cataloging this massive

2124
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,719
collection a couple years ago

2125
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,440
we we actually pulled some out and did

2126
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,960
some germination tests on these you know

2127
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:27,039
25 year old seeds and we were pulling

2128
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,920
out 25 year old seeds that were

2129
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:32,399
germinating at like 80 90 percent

2130
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,399
right so that's perfectly sufficient for

2131
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:35,439
i think the time scale of the rest of my

2132
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,399
life

2133
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:39,678
um i think seed fridges are fine you can

2134
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:41,599
now do

2135
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:43,359
i've got a friend in that was working in

2136
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,760
spain name he's a sicilian guy named

2137
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,679
salvatore cassano and he started doing

2138
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,360
some cryopreservation on seeds and that

2139
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,679
worked out pretty well

2140
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,519
um like a deep freeze in liquid nitrogen

2141
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,199
or sorry you you actually don't put the

2142
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,239
seeds in the liquid nitrogen you store

2143
01:11:55,198 --> 01:12:00,479
them in the gas above the liquid so it's

2144
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,079
not quite as cold

2145
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:03,678
um

2146
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:04,559
and i thought that was really cool and

2147
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,000
so

2148
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,560
i started looking into whether we could

2149
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
freeze tissue cultures and

2150
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,640
you can like there's all these different

2151
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,800
protocols online for hops and other

2152
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,679
plants on how to

2153
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,600
actually freeze shoot tips

2154
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,600
and there's a real trick to it

2155
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,800
there's a few tricks to it and it's

2156
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,360
quite difficult but it's actually

2157
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,360
possible

2158
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,079
again it's an expense

2159
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,079
right it costs money to do it and

2160
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,519
maintain the tissue cultures at that

2161
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:34,960
temperature for

2162
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,600
extended periods of time but it's

2163
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,039
totally possible

2164
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,920
so yeah you can freeze it you can use

2165
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,840
crop preservation to freeze material

2166
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,520
you can use cryo preservation to freeze

2167
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,880
seeds and you can keep seeds in the

2168
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,560
fridge for

2169
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,560
a long time and as long as they're

2170
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,840
properly dried

2171
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,239
you can do things like flushing them

2172
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,520
with oxygen or not oxygen i'm sorry you

2173
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,000
eliminate the oxygen from the

2174
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,560
environment where the seeds are stored

2175
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,238
um like you know specific little vials

2176
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,000
or something or nitrogen container

2177
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:04,959
nitrogen containers where you've pushed

2178
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,439
out the

2179
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,359
the oxygen gas you essentially flood it

2180
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,759
with with nitrogen and then you seal it

2181
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:13,198
um and those can extend the seed life

2182
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,119
even further

2183
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:16,719
so i don't think you know this a lot of

2184
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:18,158
people get all bent out of shape it's

2185
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,480
like oh you're selling these seeds and

2186
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,479
they're 12 years old it's like just put

2187
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:23,839
them in the dirt and see you know don't

2188
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:24,959
worry about how old they are if they

2189
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,719
germinate

2190
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,439
then they're germinating and if they

2191
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,880
don't i'll send you more right

2192
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:33,039
that's kind of the way i feel about it

2193
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,880
like i'm not you know i don't obviously

2194
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,039
i don't retail seeds myself we sell them

2195
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,600
through legal channels and in europe but

2196
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:41,039
i always tell my retailers

2197
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,320
if you have problems and people calling

2198
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:44,800
and complaining just give them more i'll

2199
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,559
replace them right like it's not

2200
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,719
i kind of i said at one point in time

2201
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,719
online it's like i'm not just giving you

2202
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,000
seeds with a germination guarantee it's

2203
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,880
like if you don't like the plants tell

2204
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,158
me

2205
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,000
right come back to me tell me what's

2206
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:57,839
wrong i'll send you more i'm gonna send

2207
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,760
you seeds until you're happy

2208
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,920
right that's what it's that's that's why

2209
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,600
we do it right i want people to grow the

2210
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,960
things that we find interesting and

2211
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,800
enjoy them

2212
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,880
and if they if they some reason grow

2213
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,640
them and they feel like that we've let

2214
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,400
them down and they they have they've had

2215
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,920
a subpar experience

2216
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:15,279
dude i'll make sure that the retailers

2217
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,880
send them the seeds until they're

2218
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:18,399
they're happy

2219
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,319
right because that's what i want from

2220
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:21,839
our customers that's why that's why i do

2221
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:23,279
the work that's why i love working with

2222
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,480
cannabis is because it makes me happy

2223
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:26,238
and i want

2224
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:29,119
other people to experience that same joy

2225
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:31,519
through our seeds

2226
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:33,679
yeah really really beautiful sentiment

2227
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,840
around the plant for sure

2228
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,800
so the next question i had was what

2229
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:41,039
style of growing do you like to do or

2230
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,719
maybe you could phrase it as what style

2231
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,279
of growing do you like to advocate for

2232
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,600
like cocoa soilless soil where do you

2233
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:47,599
stand

2234
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:51,359
it's you know

2235
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,120
to me it's six to one half a dozen the

2236
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:54,880
other i think all growers are gonna find

2237
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:56,559
they're all or they're all gonna find

2238
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,600
their own unique thing

2239
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,400
i think if i had my druthers

2240
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,320
live

2241
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:04,639
organic soil

2242
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:04,639
um

2243
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,400
respectful of the plant respectful of

2244
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,719
the environment respectful of your

2245
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:12,639
resources around you you know i don't

2246
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,399
like the idea of people growing with

2247
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,320
tons of salts and that running off into

2248
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,319
groundwater or

2249
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,238
you know people flushing nutrients down

2250
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,479
the toilet i mean that's all [ __ ] to

2251
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:24,479
me like it's really not okay to be doing

2252
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:25,919
that to the planet we don't need to be

2253
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,919
damaging the planet just because we're

2254
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,440
growing some cannabis

2255
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,960
it should be able to be grown in line

2256
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:32,399
with nature

2257
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,920
but

2258
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:35,359
you know if you have to grow in a

2259
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,039
there's reasons why you would want to

2260
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:39,039
grow in a sterile hydroponic system

2261
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,480
for you know if you're in a certain

2262
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:44,000
commercial greenhouse or whatever

2263
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,319
there's lots of there's lots of ways to

2264
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,880
grow cannabis and i'm not really against

2265
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:51,519
or for any of them i think if people can

2266
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:53,600
be sustainable about it and healthy

2267
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,360
about it and you're not spraying like

2268
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,960
aggro chemicals on the plants like

2269
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:59,920
pesticides and fungicides and all that

2270
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,439
kind of stuff i think that that's really

2271
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,480
to me that those are the important

2272
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:03,678
things

2273
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:05,279
um

2274
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,119
we did a bunch of work on different

2275
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,319
cultivation varieties with our because

2276
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:10,399
again we had this lab in the

2277
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,479
standardized cultivation environment

2278
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,559
both greenhouse and indoor

2279
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:16,158
we could run the same cultivars over and

2280
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,480
over and over again

2281
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:20,559
in different iterate like so we'd have a

2282
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,238
you know it was it was large had a

2283
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,520
couple hundred lights so and we had like

2284
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:27,439
20 light rooms for example so

2285
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,719
every week you'd be harvesting a

2286
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:33,039
different room so rather than putting

2287
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,640
making one room emoji cushion one room

2288
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,359
train wreck and run

2289
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,360
room blue dream we would run a single

2290
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,759
four by eight table of each cultivar in

2291
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:43,519
every room and harvest it every week

2292
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,840
and then those samples would all go to

2293
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,120
the laboratory

2294
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,440
we would do random sampling from the

2295
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:51,920
crops or represent representative

2296
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:54,719
sampling from the crops and each crop

2297
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,719
would get a lab test and so what it

2298
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,119
allowed us to do is go back and look at

2299
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:02,319
the environmental data

2300
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:03,279
and see oh look there's a you know there

2301
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:05,519
was a

2302
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:07,679
humidity spike or a temperature spike at

2303
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,400
this week and look how it changed the

2304
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:12,399
terpene profile we would vary the diets

2305
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:14,079
on the plant we would feed them you know

2306
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,158
chemical fertilizers we would feed them

2307
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:18,399
organic fertilizers we'd feed them

2308
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,079
chemical fertilizers with a biostimulant

2309
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:23,198
or organic fertilizer or the

2310
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:25,039
biostimulant and you'd see like oh look

2311
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:27,039
when you use

2312
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,880
when you use organic

2313
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:30,719
when you use organics to organic methods

2314
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,840
with biostimulants

2315
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,279
the

2316
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,719
uh the terpenes would go up and the

2317
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:35,439
cannabinoids would drop down a little

2318
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,039
bit

2319
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,599
when you were growing them more or less

2320
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:41,119
hydroponically with chemical salts very

2321
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,120
little organic inputs the the

2322
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:45,039
cannabinoids would spike and the th or

2323
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,238
the the terpene contents would crash a

2324
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:48,800
little bit

2325
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:48,799
right so

2326
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:52,960
there's all there they're just tool to

2327
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:54,158
me it's just they're just tools in the

2328
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,679
toolbox

2329
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:57,279
it's really about what you're trying to

2330
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,880
do if you're making really beautiful

2331
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:02,399
extracts

2332
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:05,840
and flavors important i'd be growing

2333
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:08,960
organically with biostimulants right

2334
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,119
if you're looking to make thc diamonds

2335
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,800
right these you've probably seen those

2336
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,599
and that kind of product

2337
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,640
yeah

2338
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,640
then

2339
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,000
use chemical salts as long as you can do

2340
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,280
it in a way that's not damaging the

2341
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,279
planet

2342
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:23,519
right

2343
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:25,679
yeah good answer good answer

2344
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,199
so this was more of a personal question

2345
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,079
i was wondering

2346
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:33,359
do you feel like there's

2347
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:35,920
a compromise between big yields fast

2348
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:37,839
flower times and inherent quality i

2349
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,079
guess what i'm wondering is

2350
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,560
in a world filled with these ultra small

2351
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:45,039
yielding exotic plants so to speak and

2352
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,360
exotic is like you know a poor code word

2353
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:49,359
for like cookies and things like that

2354
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,519
sure i feel like there does still exist

2355
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:53,679
a plant that's like big yielding fast

2356
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,440
flowering high quality or

2357
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,679
at some point you have to kind of

2358
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,279
compromise on some of those traits

2359
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,119
we have to compromise today because

2360
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,119
those combinations of traits don't exist

2361
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,719
together but i firmly believe that

2362
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,559
through proper breeding strategies and

2363
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,560
especially with the aid of genomics and

2364
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,400
the laboratory chemical analysis that we

2365
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,159
can get the best of both worlds

2366
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:13,279
right that's the joy and the goal of the

2367
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:14,238
breeding

2368
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:15,920
is that

2369
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,759
it's all about what we can produce for

2370
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,719
the future right

2371
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,000
um

2372
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,399
and really those things are just

2373
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
combinations of traits and there's no

2374
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,679
reasons that we can't just shuffle the

2375
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,399
deck and put all those combinations of

2376
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:30,158
traits together in a specific way yeah

2377
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,000
right now the ogs and the things like

2378
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,198
that the cookies they're small

2379
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,198
right but you can

2380
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:38,479
you can embig in them maybe is the good

2381
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,159
word

2382
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:42,079
through uh through selection and

2383
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:44,238
breeding right you can improve their

2384
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,920
yield you can improve their

2385
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,319
uh their stature you can improve their

2386
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,119
resistance and that's that stuff is it's

2387
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:52,559
gonna take time right like these aren't

2388
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,399
this does not make a couple of crosses

2389
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,000
and boom next year we got a huge cookies

2390
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:57,359
right this these will be like five ten

2391
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,760
year projects

2392
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:01,279
where you learn to understand

2393
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,000
oh these are the genes that are

2394
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:06,319
important for bigness in cannabis and

2395
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,880
then you reshuffle those genes reach off

2396
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:10,880
of the deck and screen

2397
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,119
and look for plants that are that have

2398
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,719
the the genes for bigness

2399
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:17,039
and the genes for

2400
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,960
whatever quality metrics we

2401
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:21,519
we ascribe to the plants together right

2402
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,760
it's the combination of those things

2403
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,159
and like i said because of linkage that

2404
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,000
might be a little bit difficult but

2405
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,599
with the right

2406
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,920
with you know with being able to scree

2407
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,520
it's really about plants it's about

2408
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,480
having to be able to screen the plant

2409
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,320
numbers having access to the lab data

2410
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,559
and being able to afford to do it that's

2411
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:44,960
really those are the barriers

2412
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,960
right so it's not impossible but

2413
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:50,319
it's also not easy

2414
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,320
yeah right so

2415
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:55,679
i was just gonna say a bit of a random

2416
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,080
one we got submitted by the guests but

2417
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,960
they they noticed that um somehow you

2418
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:03,119
ended up on one of the george cevante

2419
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,079
dvds about how to grow marijuana and

2420
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:05,599
they were wondering what was the

2421
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,679
backstory behind that was it just like

2422
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,079
coincidental timing you were there or

2423
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,319
how'd that go down no george found me

2424
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:13,679
online i guess he was writing a new book

2425
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:15,198
and he was trying to get contributions

2426
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,319
from all these people

2427
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:17,599
and he said

2428
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:19,279
oh everybody that he asked about

2429
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,520
breeding they said come and talk to

2430
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:23,759
chimera and so he found me

2431
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,199
and i he just you know he he sent me an

2432
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,840
email one day

2433
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:29,359
and i was like no [ __ ] it's jorge i

2434
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,360
didn't know you know i just knew him as

2435
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:33,119
the guy through the books right

2436
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,920
the books and the dvds so when he caught

2437
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:37,679
me contacted me i was like right on yeah

2438
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,359
i'll uh i'll chat with you and he's like

2439
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:40,800
i want to do this breeding chapter and

2440
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,119
i'm thinking you know you're the guy to

2441
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,039
do it and so i agreed to

2442
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:47,599
to do the breeding chapter for the book

2443
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:51,519
and he came to

2444
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:52,480
vancouver about six six months later

2445
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,080
um

2446
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:56,959
funnily enough it was the the week

2447
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:58,559
before mark emery was busted by the dea

2448
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,158
on the charges that got him extradited

2449
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,440
to the united states

2450
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:06,000
and so that week before we built a grow

2451
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:08,079
room in the bank across the street from

2452
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
mark emery's shop

2453
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,519
and just for the purpose of the vid i

2454
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,880
mean we didn't grow in it but we built

2455
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,000
it for the purposes of showing people

2456
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:17,840
how to build a grow room for the video

2457
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,279
and i kind of took him around the city

2458
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,560
and introduced him to a bunch of people

2459
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:21,920
and he he said to me one day he's like

2460
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,199
you got to be in this video and i was

2461
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,359
like george i don't want to be in your

2462
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:26,238
video i'm not interested in putting my

2463
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:27,599
face

2464
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:28,799
on the video and he said we'll get you a

2465
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,639
mask

2466
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:35,360
and so that was it that was how i ended

2467
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,359
up on that video in a weird lions mask

2468
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:41,519
good good backstory and maybe you can

2469
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:43,439
fill us in likewise on this next one

2470
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,360
are you able to tell us a little bit

2471
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:49,919
about the [ __ ] morocco you selected from

2472
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:52,399
the moroccan line

2473
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,000
yeah she's a bear she's just i don't

2474
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:55,198
know i don't know how moroccan she was

2475
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,479
you got to understand it's like you were

2476
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:58,479
saying before

2477
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:00,158
things kind of get modernized because

2478
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:02,959
people bring in

2479
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:03,920
um new genetics right so

2480
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,920
what

2481
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,760
moroccan originally was i think it came

2482
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,440
from turkish hemp because it's just it's

2483
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,800
so similar

2484
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:12,479
um

2485
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,279
and the cannabinoid contents were really

2486
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:16,879
low for traditional moroccan hash now

2487
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,319
obviously over the last 30 years they've

2488
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,359
been bringing dutch seeds down there all

2489
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:23,279
the time it's not very far and as you

2490
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:25,119
know i mean moroccan hash is one of the

2491
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:27,439
main major one of the major export

2492
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:29,039
centers for moroccan hash is amsterdam

2493
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:30,638
so there's definitely a lot of back and

2494
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:32,238
forth that people are doing between

2495
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,960
business between those two places and i

2496
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:36,319
think as the guys would come up to to

2497
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,840
sell their hash

2498
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:39,198
they'd buy some seeds and bring those

2499
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,119
back down and those things would get

2500
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:44,399
crossed into

2501
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:46,800
uh the natural populations and over time

2502
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,559
they become more modernized so this one

2503
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,320
plant that we got there that i pulled

2504
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,239
out of the population

2505
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:53,920
it was fat i mean it was like six and a

2506
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:56,079
half weeks seven weeks and it was like

2507
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,679
pretty much done but it had this really

2508
01:23:56,079 --> 01:24:00,319
strange well it wasn't this

2509
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:01,920
unheard of trait but it used so it put

2510
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:03,840
on so much weight in like week three and

2511
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,199
week four like it was bulking up before

2512
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,960
other plants were even putting little

2513
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:08,479
cotton balls on the tips of their their

2514
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,079
shoes

2515
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:14,319
um

2516
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:16,238
and it used it used so much nitrogen

2517
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:18,238
that if you if you if you stopped

2518
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:20,319
feeding it vegetative food

2519
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:22,238
and then switched to to flowering food

2520
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:24,399
right at 12 12 or when you induced it

2521
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:26,559
into flour by the time you were like the

2522
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:28,238
end of week three or beginning week four

2523
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,000
the plant was really yellowing out

2524
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,119
significantly

2525
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,479
um

2526
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,238
and it was doing that because it was

2527
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:37,119
using so much nitrogen to build that

2528
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:38,079
really early floral mass

2529
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:39,119
and

2530
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,039
uh

2531
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:42,479
that was a pretty neat trait if you

2532
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:44,158
could you know as soon as i learned that

2533
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:45,519
about the timing of the trade it it

2534
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:46,559
caught me off guard for a couple of

2535
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,400
grows

2536
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,320
and then finally i was like i'm gonna

2537
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:52,079
hit this thing with with way more

2538
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,559
nitrogen than the rest of the plants

2539
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:55,679
early in flower and it managed to stay

2540
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,239
green all the way through and the thing

2541
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,600
just bulked like crazy

2542
01:24:58,238 --> 01:25:01,359
um

2543
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,800
really good like we were talking about

2544
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:04,319
growers plants before this one was a

2545
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,000
grower's plant

2546
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:08,319
but it had a really nice kind of

2547
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,198
raspberry nose to it

2548
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,198
um

2549
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:13,039
fruity but like really in that kind of

2550
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:15,119
raspberry flavor class

2551
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:16,800
and she just became something i was like

2552
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:18,158
this thing is actually worth

2553
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,560
keeping and worth breeding with so we

2554
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:23,359
did we made a bunch of crosses with it

2555
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:26,400
and she's still around but it's um yeah

2556
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:28,399
that's that's what we're using

2557
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:30,559
there you go a great little explanation

2558
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:32,399
on that one on to the next strain of

2559
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,480
yours i'm interested in and we've had a

2560
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:36,559
few people inquire about you even

2561
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:38,559
mentioned it yourself the mental floss

2562
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,400
will you ever remake it and what do you

2563
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,400
think it was about that lime which made

2564
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:44,000
it so memorable in so many people's

2565
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:46,079
minds

2566
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,760
probably the name

2567
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:50,079
it was a great commercial plant it was

2568
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,079
for me it was a great commercial plant

2569
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:54,158
um i could i could pull two pounds off

2570
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:56,238
of light no problem and it and the thing

2571
01:25:54,158 --> 01:25:58,960
that i really loved about it is it made

2572
01:25:56,238 --> 01:26:01,599
these this really really high quality

2573
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,000
bubble hash like water hash and even dry

2574
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:06,079
sift was it was incredible but it really

2575
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,119
held on to its flavor through the water

2576
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:10,559
process and it made a hash that was just

2577
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,800
fantastic i remember bringing it to

2578
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,840
amsterdam the first time i met david and

2579
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,800
david is an insane hash head

2580
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,239
and

2581
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,480
our you know our mutual friend bubble

2582
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,799
man he was there and he said david you

2583
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:25,039
really got to try this hashish

2584
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,520
and pulled it in and there's something i

2585
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:29,359
call the tell or the bubble towel when

2586
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,560
when the hatch is of such a high quality

2587
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:32,079
and you put it in the pipe for someone

2588
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,239
and they can see the ball when they're

2589
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:36,000
br when they're burning it their eyes

2590
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:37,198
open up and their eyebrows essentially

2591
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,800
hit the roof

2592
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:40,799
right because they're so surprised at

2593
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,880
the the way that it melts and and the

2594
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,279
flavor that comes off of it

2595
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,719
and uh you know i put it in dave's bowl

2596
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:48,399
and

2597
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:50,000
he was uh

2598
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:52,719
he definitely gave the bubble tell it

2599
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,198
was like you know it was

2600
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,639
it was hard for him to not you know to

2601
01:26:55,198 --> 01:26:58,079
to be like i can't you know it was hard

2602
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,239
for him to not give me respect at that

2603
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,679
point in time because not only did he

2604
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:03,599
think i knew what i was talking about i

2605
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,039
might have been a lot younger

2606
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,400
but um

2607
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,639
you know

2608
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:10,399
i had the good quality hash and that's

2609
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,000
kind of like the

2610
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:15,519
the secret handshake to get into the

2611
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,840
club right if you show up with the great

2612
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,360
hash that you've made

2613
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,960
yourself um

2614
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,279
it's kind of like you're welcome to sit

2615
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,359
at the table right

2616
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:27,439
yeah of course

2617
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:29,359
so that's one of the reasons why she's

2618
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:30,638
also got a beautiful color i mean you

2619
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:32,399
can probably see that picture on my

2620
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,319
twitter and you might have seen them

2621
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:36,079
online she does this great

2622
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:38,238
lovely rainbow thing when it goes at the

2623
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,920
end of flowering the leaves go from

2624
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:41,839
purple to yellow

2625
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,079
shades of purple and yellow

2626
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:47,039
all on the same leaf and it's just a

2627
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:50,880
beautiful plant with a beautiful smell

2628
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:50,880
great yield super dense nugs

2629
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:55,599
and so yeah so i've got it'll come back

2630
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,920
in in some form i've got tons of

2631
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,520
different hybrids of it but i'm really

2632
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,199
working on the right combination of

2633
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,560
plants for the next release of it

2634
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,559
there's still tons of the original i

2635
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,440
mean i've got to have there's

2636
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,679
there's

2637
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:09,599
you know at least 10 20 000 seeds left

2638
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:11,760
over the first one so

2639
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,520
if anybody wants it you can still hop on

2640
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,520
board

2641
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,080
that's exciting to hear

2642
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:21,280
the next one i wanted to ask about was

2643
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:24,238
in your sassafras cross you use what you

2644
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:25,439
refer to as the superior afghan skunk

2645
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:27,519
would you be able to tell us a little

2646
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:29,279
bit more about that and what made it so

2647
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,440
memorable and just superior to the

2648
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:32,960
others in your mind

2649
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:35,359
well it was superior to the others i

2650
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:38,000
think going honestly going back

2651
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:40,000
i probably wouldn't use that plant again

2652
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
um it was superior than the other afghan

2653
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,800
skulls that i had seen because it had a

2654
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,760
great growing characteristic and stature

2655
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,079
and a nice flower

2656
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,600
it was it was old school

2657
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:53,920
weed it wasn't

2658
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,320
new school weed right it wasn't it

2659
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,079
didn't have that banging

2660
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:00,000
scent profile that a lot of the newer

2661
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,840
stuff has

2662
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,679
it was great that you could grow it

2663
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,119
surreptitiously you know like i could

2664
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:07,359
hand it to commercial growers and they

2665
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:09,519
could put up big growers of it and

2666
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:11,920
not worry about scent that kind of stuff

2667
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,880
but i've really moved away from those

2668
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,079
plants

2669
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,520
um

2670
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:18,079
i tried to move away from those plants

2671
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:20,159
because i think that we've

2672
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:21,679
graduated out of that phase of having to

2673
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,319
grow

2674
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,279
low set

2675
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:27,439
plants

2676
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:28,800
right i went into this hydrostar once

2677
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:30,559
and when i first moved to vancouver i

2678
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,239
went into this hider store and you know

2679
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,080
some of my girlfriends

2680
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:36,399
brought me in to meet this plant

2681
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:38,158
pathologist girl that was working there

2682
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:39,839
and they introduced me and she said oh

2683
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,439
you grew you invented the free you bred

2684
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,600
the frostbite didn't you and i said yeah

2685
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:46,079
i did actually and she was like that

2686
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:49,039
plant almost got me [ __ ] busted you

2687
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:51,600
know she was so limited about how much

2688
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,920
that plant stank right

2689
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:56,000
and and it was like you know i was like

2690
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,239
yeah that's kind of what

2691
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,158
we select for now right like that's

2692
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:01,039
that's what we want

2693
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:03,519
um

2694
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:06,679
get some carbon filters so

2695
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,679
but yeah

2696
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,719
yeah

2697
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:12,158
sorry sorry please go on no just she

2698
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,520
relayed the story about her landlord

2699
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:15,198
standing outside and she was trying to

2700
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,960
get rid of them it was

2701
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:20,719
you know grower problems right

2702
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,000
that's it right thankfully carbon

2703
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,520
filters are pretty good these days

2704
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,198
yeah yeah

2705
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,840
so the next one

2706
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:31,919
the c4 strain this had always caught my

2707
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:35,360
eye because obviously the name it's very

2708
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,760
close to the c5 which is a notable clone

2709
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:39,519
a northern lights haze however the

2710
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:41,600
genetics couldn't be more different on

2711
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:43,679
paper a cotton candy crossed by shishka

2712
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,679
berry was this an intentional play on

2713
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:48,560
words because you saw some similarities

2714
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:50,639
or purely coincidental no the c4 for me

2715
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,719
meant fast and explosive there was a

2716
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,239
kind of porsche porsche carrera 4 and

2717
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:55,439
that was really what was named after

2718
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:57,039
that and the

2719
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:58,719
idea that it was so fun i mean it hit

2720
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,840
this thing also hit like week six and

2721
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:04,319
seven and just exploded

2722
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:06,400
um and i i really thought that it was i

2723
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:07,920
still do feel like it was a big

2724
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:10,000
improvement on either of the two parent

2725
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,158
plants like when they came together

2726
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,600
you know one plus one definitely equaled

2727
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:16,960
three

2728
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:19,600
um it had the best of both really rock

2729
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,600
hard flowers i remember i had this one

2730
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,520
one grower i think he went by the name

2731
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,400
reggie the roddy and he used to grow the

2732
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,239
stuff

2733
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:27,359
and just turn the the entire crop into

2734
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:29,839
hash

2735
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:31,519
and he had this the hash was white like

2736
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,840
it was beautiful it was the most

2737
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,679
light-colored hash i've ever seen

2738
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,239
and you'd put a flame to it and it would

2739
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:40,560
just turn to a liquid right away

2740
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:40,559
um

2741
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:44,800
and so yeah i'll i'll probably do

2742
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:46,638
something with that in the f when i want

2743
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,960
to get some space to actually grow into

2744
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:51,760
we've actually got an opportunity now

2745
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,439
um with two different 20 plus acre legal

2746
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,480
farms that are within an hour of where i

2747
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:56,319
live now

2748
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:58,000
and they've both offered me as much

2749
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:59,039
space as i want to kind of play over

2750
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,719
there

2751
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:02,719
and just screen for things and we're

2752
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,119
gonna start you know try to improve the

2753
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:06,560
auto lines that we're working with and

2754
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,960
really try to make

2755
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,920
true to type

2756
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,520
um

2757
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,199
auto plants you know a lot of times

2758
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,880
you'll buy like these days you'll buy

2759
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:16,719
auto plant that's like auto cookies or

2760
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,239
auto whatever the name is

2761
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:20,880
and they don't actually smell anything

2762
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,479
like the named plant right because autos

2763
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,319
are a little bit of a

2764
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:25,759
a tricky thing to work with breeding

2765
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:27,759
wise that you have to breed them in a

2766
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,280
slightly different way you can't keep

2767
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:32,079
backup clones

2768
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:34,880
or most people can't keep backup clones

2769
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:36,800
um so because they're just difficult to

2770
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,400
keep alive in that in the clonal state

2771
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,440
unless you're using a specific tissue

2772
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,839
culture

2773
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:41,839
regimen

2774
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:46,158
so we're going to try to use genomics

2775
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:48,000
and

2776
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:50,879
you know classical breeding techniques

2777
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,719
to actually make auto versions of

2778
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,400
all the plants that you you know that

2779
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:55,920
you'd want to have on the market because

2780
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:57,599
that kind of thing in canada would be

2781
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,719
really ideal for

2782
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,719
the new um

2783
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,800
the new industry where people are

2784
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,039
growing purely for

2785
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,440
you know for example rosin extracts

2786
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,600
right you want to have like

2787
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:12,960
a few acres or more

2788
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,480
ideally

2789
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,239
of plants that are going to fall that

2790
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:18,079
are going to flower fast

2791
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:20,079
uh we have a relatively short season

2792
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:22,158
here in in canada compared to say

2793
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,519
california we can't grow you know you

2794
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:24,960
got to pretty much be done and out of

2795
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,080
the ground by

2796
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,679
mid to

2797
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:29,198
late september in most parts of the

2798
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,760
country

2799
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:33,519
and even going that long you might be

2800
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,719
well into the wet season so you're

2801
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,480
risking

2802
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:38,158
you know molds and all the bad things

2803
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:40,238
that come with rain

2804
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:41,599
um and flowering cannabis together

2805
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:43,599
outside

2806
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:46,560
so the idea is to like really try to

2807
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:48,560
breed those things um

2808
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,159
and screen a lot of the old stuff i mean

2809
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,960
you just can't i've got so many seeds

2810
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:52,960
like

2811
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,158
you can't grow them

2812
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,679
you know all indoors are in the

2813
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:56,719
greenhouses we just don't have that much

2814
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,119
room so

2815
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:00,960
a couple of 20 acre plots is pretty

2816
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:03,359
attractive to

2817
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,198
uh to look at for screening right the

2818
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:07,519
question is will everything finish in

2819
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:09,839
time but you just you don't know until

2820
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:12,000
you do it so

2821
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,880
yeah sure sure

2822
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,119
so maybe a bit of a hard one to answer

2823
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,800
but out of all the various lines you've

2824
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:20,559
worked thus far

2825
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,440
which are you most proud of or most

2826
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,440
pleased with the results

2827
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:27,519
it's kind of like asking a father what

2828
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:29,839
kid child is their favorite

2829
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,880
um honestly the most proud

2830
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,199
one

2831
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:35,520
of the last couple years has been

2832
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:37,039
this beta-caryophyllene cbd plant that i

2833
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,199
bred for the group down in california

2834
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:40,319
that was subsequently patented

2835
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:42,559
um

2836
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:47,119
cbdv is a chemical everybody knows about

2837
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:48,320
thc thcv but cbdv is

2838
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:50,479
um

2839
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:53,359
a chemical that's even more effective

2840
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:55,519
for epilepsy than cbd

2841
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:57,599
and so we created a variety when i found

2842
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,880
the the propyl plants and started

2843
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:03,039
breeding them into the cbd background

2844
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,199
we ended up finding plants that were

2845
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:07,760
like roughly 50 50 percent of the

2846
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:10,638
cannabinoid fraction was cbd and the

2847
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,639
other 50 was cbdv with like very little

2848
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,600
thc in it

2849
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,440
so it had zero recreational or fun

2850
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,719
potential it was not that kind of

2851
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:21,039
program

2852
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,719
um but the idea hidden came to me at one

2853
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:24,399
point in time actually i was at the icrs

2854
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:26,158
listening some speakers talk there about

2855
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:26,960
beta carryoff lean

2856
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:29,759
and

2857
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,560
they mentioned that beta carotene was a

2858
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,199
um

2859
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,120
it had anti-spasmodic properties

2860
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:36,879
and i was like damn that's perfect i

2861
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:40,479
need to breed a beta-caryophyllene

2862
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:41,440
terpene profile into the cbdv line

2863
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,119
um

2864
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:45,119
and then i started looking at what other

2865
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:47,359
terpenoids could also have

2866
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:48,800
anti-spasmodic defect and linole which

2867
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:51,119
is from lavender

2868
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,960
also has some anti um

2869
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,158
convulsive properties

2870
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,679
and so i was like you know what i'm just

2871
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:59,039
gonna try and find a plant that i can

2872
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:00,480
stack with cbd cbdv and if i can make it

2873
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:03,198
have a terpene profile that's like

2874
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:04,718
beta-carotene and little rich

2875
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:06,079
then that's probably going to be a good

2876
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:08,079
plant for

2877
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:10,639
kids with epilepsy or right that was

2878
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,800
kind of the the genesis is like how do

2879
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,719
you take a medicine like cbd that all

2880
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,679
these children are using for

2881
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:17,679
you know

2882
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:19,119
what is it lennox gusto syndrome or

2883
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:21,440
whatever it's called

2884
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:24,000
um these epileptive disorders for

2885
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:25,919
children and they're really massive

2886
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,439
these these these kids have epilepsy so

2887
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,960
bad that it leads to these massive

2888
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:30,319
developmental problems i don't know if

2889
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,239
you know the story of

2890
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:36,000
charlotte figgy but i mean

2891
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:38,079
you know she she passed this year and

2892
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,359
she was just a kid like she was a baby

2893
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:40,238
really

2894
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:42,000
um

2895
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:43,678
and it's just horrible watching these

2896
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,279
kids go through this stuff and if you

2897
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,359
can make a medicine that actually works

2898
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:50,158
for them

2899
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:52,238
that's pretty awesome and so i'm not in

2900
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:54,638
the medical testing space like that's

2901
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:56,559
really i don't consider that my job

2902
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:58,480
i kind of see my job as

2903
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,080
let's make the plants and then let the

2904
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:01,599
doctors figure out what's going to work

2905
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:02,639
for the kids

2906
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,800
but

2907
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:08,639
when when we cross the cbd v plant that

2908
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,400
i'd made into

2909
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,079
the plants for the desired

2910
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:13,279
terpene profile

2911
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:14,559
we had to flip through a couple of

2912
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:16,238
generations but after a couple of

2913
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,480
generations this one plant popped out

2914
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:20,559
and boom it had the right cannabinoids

2915
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:23,039
and it had the right terpenoids

2916
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,719
and it was really like the in my opinion

2917
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:26,399
and maybe i'm biased in saying this but

2918
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,719
i think that in my opinion it was really

2919
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:30,719
one of the first

2920
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:32,480
plants that was made

2921
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,480
so that you had the cannabinoids that

2922
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:36,158
were effective for

2923
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:37,198
are potentially effective for this one

2924
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:38,638
condition

2925
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:41,439
and then you surrounded it with an

2926
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:46,079
entourage effect of molecules

2927
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:47,118
that that had the you know that also

2928
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:48,800
had

2929
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:51,599
been shown in the scientific literature

2930
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,560
to do that same kind of thing right

2931
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:57,440
and uh it just to me it was like it kind

2932
01:37:54,560 --> 01:38:00,159
of epitomized that new kind of potential

2933
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:03,439
that what we could do with cannabis

2934
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:05,679
where you're creating a plant with the

2935
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:07,839
idea that it's actually optimized for a

2936
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,359
specific condition right a specific

2937
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,199
ailment

2938
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:12,960
um

2939
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:14,319
and so when it popped out and it worked

2940
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,000
it was you know it started off as a

2941
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:17,759
breeding goal like can we do this it was

2942
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,679
a breeding experiment

2943
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,600
and when we found the plant it was like

2944
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,880
man it was just a really good feeling

2945
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,920
you know

2946
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,000
um

2947
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:28,079
so yeah i hope i hope that plant ended

2948
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,719
up making it into the hands of people

2949
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:33,359
of children that could use it

2950
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,800
yeah what a powerful and fulfilling

2951
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:35,759
feeling that must have been at the end

2952
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,360
of it all

2953
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,119
yeah well i mean you know we've always

2954
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:40,960
been breeding for how plants make you

2955
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:42,960
feel and there's nothing wrong with that

2956
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,960
it's just a totally different it's a

2957
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,480
different type of cannabis it's like

2958
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,719
okay i'm gonna make some cannabis that's

2959
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:49,919
not for the stoners

2960
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,239
right and

2961
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,399
to be able to create a plant with

2962
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:55,919
potential therapeutic benefit that's

2963
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:57,519
gonna help children that are really

2964
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,600
suffering is like

2965
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,199
jesus dude it's so rewarding like i

2966
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,679
can't even tell you how good it made you

2967
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:05,599
feel when it pat when it popped up

2968
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:07,440
right it's like yeah let's let's let's

2969
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,320
figure out how to make more plants like

2970
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:09,919
this

2971
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:13,118
that have no

2972
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,639
fun potential right

2973
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:16,238
you know because it's great i like

2974
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:17,600
making the fun plants too i mean i'm all

2975
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:18,879
about it right

2976
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,960
but um

2977
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,400
it's just another it's just another

2978
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,079
thing to help a different group of

2979
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:26,879
people right

2980
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:28,559
yeah so so

2981
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,079
getting towards the tail end of things

2982
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:33,199
just so you know i

2983
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:36,719
don't want to keep you too late um

2984
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:38,638
are there any bc varieties that you feel

2985
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,800
don't really get the mention they

2986
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:42,560
deserve ones that kind of fly under the

2987
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,320
radar and the add-on to that would be

2988
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,239
are there any maybe older school

2989
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:50,000
breeders who similarly don't really get

2990
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:50,000
the recognition you think they deserve

2991
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:54,000
yeah there's probably tons of them i

2992
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:56,079
mean i think most people i try to be

2993
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,800
pretty good about propping the guys that

2994
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,319
i

2995
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,920
like i mean i really like jaime from

2996
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:01,599
residence deeds there's a few other

2997
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,920
people over working with otto's in spain

2998
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,679
i've got a good friend named roberto

2999
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,039
who's who has a seat company i think

3000
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:08,960
he's actually folded the company but

3001
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:10,079
they were doing grass-o-matic

3002
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,520
and they were they're kind of neat

3003
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:13,840
little hybrids

3004
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,840
um

3005
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:17,839
i think anybody that's working you know

3006
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:19,439
jaime from resin seeds has worked with

3007
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,360
catatonic

3008
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:23,839
my friend salvatore cassano that is not

3009
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:26,238
a drug he's a he works more with like

3010
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,880
hemp and cbg varieties and he's an

3011
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:30,399
incredible agronomist and

3012
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,319
you know there's a there's a lot of

3013
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:35,039
people out there

3014
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:36,238
that are doing things just quietly and

3015
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:37,840
you know i just met another guy

3016
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:39,759
yesterday and he lives just on an island

3017
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,600
just off the coast here

3018
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,719
and um

3019
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,719
he's doing a whole bunch of interesting

3020
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:46,800
work and i'd never even met him i didn't

3021
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:48,319
even know he existed so

3022
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,000
you know just i'd like to reach out to

3023
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:52,479
all those people and meet them and then

3024
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,279
you know see how we can support them and

3025
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:56,799
how we can help make their work better

3026
01:40:55,279 --> 01:41:00,479
um

3027
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:02,719
in terms of the vancouver island stuff

3028
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,479
our industry out here got really went

3029
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:06,079
through a a

3030
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,000
not a great phase with all the purple

3031
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:10,158
cushions i mean everybody liked it you

3032
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,198
know the market certainly loves it

3033
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:12,559
but

3034
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:14,000
the genetic diversity amongst the

3035
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,600
growers is like everybody started

3036
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,760
growing the purple and the paint kush

3037
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,679
and baba kush and you know at least we

3038
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,280
have these plants here people call like

3039
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,600
death bubba and all these different

3040
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:25,599
variations on the kushes they're really

3041
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,039
all the same flavor

3042
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,039
class they're

3043
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:31,279
they're they're different variations of

3044
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:33,679
high limonene uh high mir mircine and

3045
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:34,880
high beta karyophiline plants

3046
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,760
um

3047
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:40,319
so kind of in that og master kush family

3048
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,719
of plants

3049
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:45,039
but um yeah we've got the market here

3050
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,880
has really gone through a period where

3051
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:48,800
it's like no i it's like if you want to

3052
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,319
grow and sell weed everybody was growing

3053
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,920
and selling kush

3054
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:53,759
and it wiped out a lot of the genetic

3055
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,840
diversity

3056
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,880
and that was all happening right around

3057
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,560
the time that i kind of left for

3058
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,079
california and so

3059
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,080
when i went to california we did this

3060
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:03,439
like i said this massively deep dive and

3061
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:05,600
analyzing all these different types of

3062
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:08,079
cannabis from all over the market

3063
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,760
and in the process learned a lot about

3064
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:12,719
the different types of chemistry's

3065
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:15,119
terpene profiles that can exist

3066
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,560
and so that's kind of really one of my

3067
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:18,559
things right now is that i'm trying to

3068
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,560
bring all those things back

3069
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,239
and

3070
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:24,239
re-diversify the market here

3071
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:25,519
right so that it's more than just that

3072
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:28,319
one

3073
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,520
flavor profile and you know like we were

3074
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:31,039
talking about before we're trying to

3075
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:34,159
bring back some of these

3076
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:36,238
milder varieties of cannabis right which

3077
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:36,960
again sounds counterintuitive to people

3078
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:38,638
but

3079
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,800
it's all about

3080
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:43,039
providing the the breadth and diversity

3081
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:44,960
of the cannabis species

3082
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:46,719
so that anybody that wants to use

3083
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,679
cannabis can have something that they

3084
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,319
enjoy

3085
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,679
right and i don't have to like you know

3086
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,880
like if i want to give something to my

3087
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:58,158
mom like if i gave her a toke of an og

3088
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,359
dude she'd be on the couch for a week

3089
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:01,039
you know

3090
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:02,479
so

3091
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:03,519
having these lighter

3092
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:04,718
lighter

3093
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,360
kind of more

3094
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:09,760
social varieties

3095
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:11,679
for certain population groups like you

3096
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,360
know a gift to grandmas and stuff that

3097
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,719
don't want us that don't want to get

3098
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:16,559
blasted and they just want to have their

3099
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:17,760
pain taken away i think that those

3100
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,880
things are really important out on the

3101
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,199
market too

3102
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:23,679
and it's uh we're facing a little bit of

3103
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:26,158
a challenge with growers and with

3104
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:28,158
distributors who don't you know they

3105
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:29,920
think that they know better

3106
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:31,679
and maybe they do but i i don't think

3107
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,039
that the the distribution people know

3108
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:34,560
better you know

3109
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:36,639
they just know that the only thing that

3110
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,800
sells is high thc stuff so they only

3111
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:40,079
want high thc stuff well it's kind of

3112
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,360
like having a liquor store that only

3113
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:43,118
sells whiskey

3114
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:44,238
right you can't get a beer or a bottle

3115
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:47,519
of wine

3116
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:48,399
and it's not really a diverse market

3117
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,040
yeah

3118
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,399
it's it's sad but true

3119
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:55,118
um

3120
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:57,679
what are your thoughts and experiences

3121
01:43:55,118 --> 01:43:59,439
on hawaiian strains and the mexican

3122
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,000
strains in general i know you've got a

3123
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:03,919
good sort of um experience base with

3124
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,238
them but the thing which interests me is

3125
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,399
that you commonly hear about thais and

3126
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:10,638
southeast asian lines being all the rage

3127
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:12,238
these days no one ever really mentions

3128
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,940
mexican do you think they'll ever make a

3129
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:15,198
comeback

3130
01:44:13,939 --> 01:44:16,879
[Music]

3131
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:18,719
i think when

3132
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,199
i mean mexico is developing an industry

3133
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:22,800
they're about to uh

3134
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:24,799
like they've got some version of

3135
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,560
legalization essentially with they're

3136
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,400
allowing home growers or not home

3137
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,760
growers but people to grow

3138
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:31,039
a little bit of their own and i think

3139
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,360
that they're trying to work out how the

3140
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:34,719
system what it's going to look like

3141
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:36,000
um so i'd like to take a lot of those

3142
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,399
things back there

3143
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,639
and replant them

3144
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:40,638
um

3145
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:43,279
again the way cannabis was grown there

3146
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:44,800
it was all grow there was nobody was

3147
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:47,039
growing from clone back then everything

3148
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,800
was grown from seed so there's probably

3149
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,238
a lot of dogs but i think that if you

3150
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,079
took them

3151
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:53,439
back down there and grew them in the

3152
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:55,760
right environment or even in very

3153
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:56,879
southern california

3154
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,159
um

3155
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,319
that you'd be able to find a lot of

3156
01:44:58,158 --> 01:45:03,359
traits of really you know related to

3157
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:05,840
resistance and

3158
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:07,198
i'd really like to see these equatorials

3159
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,000
i mean it would be hard to sell them in

3160
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:12,799
the canadian marketplace because just

3161
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,238
you know the market wants big fat buds

3162
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,400
it's kind of a weird thing i mean it's

3163
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:18,479
just what it is what it is

3164
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:20,719
but um you know i'd like to put on like

3165
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:22,158
the the the hot the guerrero and that

3166
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:24,560
highland mexican cross with the

3167
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:26,719
blueberry because it's it just makes

3168
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:29,520
these weird knuckly

3169
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:31,439
long fox taily spirals just collections

3170
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,480
of bracts right

3171
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:34,399
and

3172
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,319
again that's i think that would be a

3173
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:38,238
sign of a healthy market when they there

3174
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:40,479
is that diversity

3175
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:44,079
in choice for consumers

3176
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:47,039
right a legal market of just kush isn't

3177
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:49,439
very exciting to me

3178
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:51,118
yeah sure i think everyone's a bit burnt

3179
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:52,960
out on that right now

3180
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:54,559
it's got its time in its place but it's

3181
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,560
like not they want to smoke it first

3182
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:59,199
thing in the morning

3183
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,880
yeah exactly exactly

3184
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:04,158
so

3185
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,719
what are your thoughts on males found in

3186
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:09,198
s1's like i think the most notable case

3187
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:11,439
of this is can a biogen release like the

3188
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:13,118
peyote purple line which supposedly was

3189
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:15,599
the result of like a male they found in

3190
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:17,679
some bubba kush s ones do you think this

3191
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:20,480
is a like a a case of pollen

3192
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:24,239
contamination or they do occur and if so

3193
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:24,238
would you be hesitant to use one

3194
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:27,198
well again i'm trying to move away from

3195
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,960
mail so i probably wouldn't use it

3196
01:46:27,198 --> 01:46:30,399
unless it had some special set of

3197
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,439
characteristics

3198
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:33,359
um

3199
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:36,158
if it is like you got to remember we can

3200
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:38,719
confirm all these things now using

3201
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:41,279
lab data or genomics right and so if you

3202
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:43,439
have a plant that is free from

3203
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:45,118
markers associated with the male sex and

3204
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:46,479
you self that plant

3205
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:48,000
and then you find

3206
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:49,678
that plant you know you find a plant

3207
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,079
that comes up as

3208
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:53,760
we'll call it in quotes male

3209
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:55,679
you can send that lab that plant to the

3210
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,679
lab the dna lab and see if it has male

3211
01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:00,079
markers if it does

3212
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:02,960
well it's a pollen contamination

3213
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:05,198
right and if not and it's a plant that's

3214
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,719
just producing male flowers

3215
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:08,638
for some other reason you know one of

3216
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:10,480
these weird genetic anomalies that we

3217
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:12,239
were talking about before

3218
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:13,599
then to me those are also interesting

3219
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:16,000
from a research point of view it's like

3220
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,920
well let's figure out why

3221
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,520
um but i don't think that i'd be more

3222
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:21,199
likely to use them

3223
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,760
because i just don't i don't know what

3224
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:25,678
benefit that it would add right but i'd

3225
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,520
probably self the plant i'd probably try

3226
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:28,560
to solve the plan and see if i could you

3227
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:32,400
know

3228
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:34,000
would that trait pass on right

3229
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:35,439
i was telling a story the other day too

3230
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,560
when rob and i were in morocco we were

3231
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:38,000
walking through these fields with

3232
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,440
thousands of plants and we found this

3233
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,039
one plant

3234
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:43,839
that was

3235
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:43,840
it was a female

3236
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:47,279
um

3237
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:49,199
but it looked for all intents and

3238
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:51,599
purposes like a male but rather than

3239
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,198
having

3240
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:55,600
male flowers they were female flowers

3241
01:47:53,198 --> 01:47:57,279
but the morphology of the flower and the

3242
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,639
way the growth habit and the stretch and

3243
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:01,198
everything

3244
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:03,118
it was a you know it was a it was a male

3245
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:06,479
it was a just a bizarre one of those

3246
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:08,238
weird off types like those really rare

3247
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:11,519
you know

3248
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:13,039
one in 10 000 kind of genetic anomalies

3249
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,800
or it looked like

3250
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:16,079
and uh

3251
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,079
you know

3252
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:19,359
it was it was just it was it was neat to

3253
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:21,039
see because it's not something that you

3254
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:22,799
see all the time

3255
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:24,158
um if i ran into something like that

3256
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,279
yeah i'd probably try to breed it out

3257
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:27,759
just for the

3258
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:30,319
anomaly of it right just to see

3259
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,840
is this can this trait be passed on

3260
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:35,118
or is it something in the plant that's

3261
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,119
just reacting to the environment

3262
01:48:35,359 --> 01:48:38,479
yeah

3263
01:48:36,158 --> 01:48:40,479
understandable it's it yeah it could be

3264
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:42,000
could be one of many things right

3265
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:43,599
yeah it could be anything and until you

3266
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,840
start doing the experiment your

3267
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,840
experiment and and analyzing it with the

3268
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:49,520
tools that we have available to us

3269
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,079
you can't actually figure it out right

3270
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,199
it's like everybody can hypothesize

3271
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:55,118
you know

3272
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:57,198
doobie is a great you know louis dewey

3273
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:58,719
the breeder for uh for ace he really

3274
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:01,039
knows what he's talking about he's also

3275
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:03,118
another super nice guy in the industry

3276
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:05,359
just a really good person

3277
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:05,359
and

3278
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,400
he knows what he's doing

3279
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:10,158
but

3280
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,238
there's you know i have another friend

3281
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:13,920
in spain

3282
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:15,519
he lives there he's actually jorge

3283
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,960
cervantes and he goes to these like

3284
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:18,400
neighborhood meetings

3285
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,079
he went to one meeting and some guy

3286
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:20,799
showed up with a male cannabis plant in

3287
01:49:20,079 --> 01:49:23,279
like

3288
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,800
in august and he ranted and raved at

3289
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:25,920
everybody in the neighborhood meeting it

3290
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,800
was like

3291
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:31,920
this is a male cannabis plant you have

3292
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:34,000
to destroy it right because

3293
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,118
you guys are all pollinating my stuff

3294
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,118
right

3295
01:49:35,118 --> 01:49:39,359
and that's kind of an inevitable thing

3296
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:41,439
with cannabis pollen like it does travel

3297
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:43,198
on the wind and and depending on what's

3298
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:44,879
going around your neighborhood and how

3299
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:48,079
you know how serious the year about your

3300
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,920
filter in takes on your grow rooms right

3301
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:52,000
pollen can get in and

3302
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,279
cross you can get cross-contamination

3303
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,118
and especially if you're doing other

3304
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:57,759
types of breeding around i mean

3305
01:49:55,118 --> 01:49:59,759
it can happen right so

3306
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,840
before i would really believe that a

3307
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:03,679
male plant came from an s1 seedling i'd

3308
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,039
want some actual data to be like okay

3309
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:07,440
let's actually just confirm your

3310
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:08,880
hypothesis and say yeah let's look at it

3311
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:11,118
and say are there genetic markers you

3312
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,719
know or is does it look like there's a

3313
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:14,158
genetic contribution from an outside

3314
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:16,000
plant and we can figure all that stuff

3315
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:17,920
out now because we have all these tools

3316
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,560
at our disposal

3317
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,079
so again i think that the

3318
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,600
growing and breeding community really

3319
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:25,519
needs to embrace these kinds of

3320
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:27,760
technologies rather than being afraid of

3321
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,760
them

3322
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:32,639
yeah definitely i mean it makes sense

3323
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:34,000
just to utilize the new in the in the

3324
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,039
current

3325
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,479
so

3326
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:40,479
i think that brings us to our final five

3327
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:42,559
questions i love these questions i we

3328
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:44,718
ask them to every guest always get great

3329
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:47,119
answers out of them so the first one is

3330
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:49,840
what's your absolute most memorable

3331
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:51,359
strain or bud or hash you've ever smoked

3332
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,199
the one that stands out more than any

3333
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:55,039
other

3334
01:50:53,198 --> 01:50:56,799
i think again it's probably nostalgia

3335
01:50:55,039 --> 01:51:01,118
but there's a friend brought me

3336
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:01,119
something that he had he worked at a

3337
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:05,600
a back country cabin up in the mountains

3338
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:08,000
of british columbia one summer and he

3339
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:10,079
came back to the town that i lived in

3340
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,560
and he had this this flower and it was

3341
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:14,000
grown from an island out here on on in

3342
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,520
the vancouver island strait or the

3343
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,880
strait in between vancouver island in

3344
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,159
the mainland

3345
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:22,079
a little a hippie island called leskidi

3346
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:24,079
and this plant was called leskidi

3347
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:26,559
sweetie is what they called it

3348
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:28,079
and it was some kind of haze variant and

3349
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,320
it was so

3350
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:32,079
ripping strong

3351
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:34,079
at least to my memory it was like really

3352
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:35,519
strong and i don't know if it was that

3353
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:37,118
everything else that i was smoking back

3354
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,040
at the time keep in mind this is i was

3355
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:41,759
in high school this is a long time ago

3356
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:42,719
um but it was it was so much stronger i

3357
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,320
don't know if it was just so much

3358
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:46,560
stronger than what i'd been smoking or

3359
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:48,079
it really was this anomaly planned but

3360
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,840
yeah that one really i remember it

3361
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:52,079
really whacking me more than anything i

3362
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:54,000
had ever said and i've never

3363
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:55,599
of course never been able to track it

3364
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,079
down again to be able to duplicate the

3365
01:51:55,599 --> 01:52:00,079
experience

3366
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:01,760
but that was a memorable one there's so

3367
01:52:00,079 --> 01:52:03,039
many i mean

3368
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:06,159
you know

3369
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:07,840
when i came back from morocco with rob

3370
01:52:06,158 --> 01:52:10,960
um

3371
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:12,880
i got we we both had the same meal the

3372
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,480
last night in morocco

3373
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:17,039
but i had

3374
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:18,559
mayo on on the fries some there was like

3375
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:19,679
a garlic mayonnaise that they had put on

3376
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,360
my fries

3377
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,960
which i shouldn't have should have known

3378
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:24,960
not to eat in like a country like

3379
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,399
morocco but of course i did

3380
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,039
and i got the worst case of food

3381
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:31,679
poisoning i've ever had like salmonella

3382
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:32,719
and i felt like i was on my deathbed uh

3383
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:35,199
coming back

3384
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:36,639
from morocco to amsterdam

3385
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:37,919
and like i mean there was people on the

3386
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:39,199
plane that were trying to kick me off

3387
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,920
the plane they thought i was spreading

3388
01:52:39,198 --> 01:52:45,039
ebola to europe and stuff like that

3389
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:46,719
i really didn't look good um

3390
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:49,118
and so we had to back we ended up back

3391
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:51,039
on you know i was i'm sleeping on the

3392
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:52,000
floor in rob's apartment for a few days

3393
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:54,079
because

3394
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,079
my host in amsterdam

3395
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:58,158
david's wife she's had the surgery and

3396
01:52:56,079 --> 01:52:59,279
she's immunocompromised so i can't just

3397
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:00,319
show up

3398
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:02,238
you know

3399
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:04,559
puking bugs all over the place right so

3400
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:07,118
i wouldn't stay on this little

3401
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:09,679
cushion on rob's floor

3402
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:11,679
and um

3403
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,760
simon had he had met with simon when we

3404
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:14,880
got back and simon had brought a little

3405
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,440
jar of

3406
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,960
uh cali mist and so i remember

3407
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:21,519
lying on the floor

3408
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:24,399
trying to like keep my bodily fluids in

3409
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:26,480
check smoking a joint of simon's cali

3410
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:28,079
mist grown in amsterdam by simon it was

3411
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:29,839
a pretty cool thing

3412
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:31,039
you know it was a little

3413
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,960
not everybody gets to have that

3414
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:35,519
experience

3415
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:37,679
well yeah that must have been very very

3416
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,080
memorable i guess on the opposite end of

3417
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:42,560
the spectrum was there ever a strain

3418
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:44,479
that just got hyped up phenomenally and

3419
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:46,560
you were really excited to try and then

3420
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:48,879
when you finally got it you were just a

3421
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,080
bit unimpressed yeah tons there's so

3422
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,239
many of them

3423
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:54,800
there's you know vancouver unfortunately

3424
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:56,399
was full of the kind of stuff we we kind

3425
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,639
of classified them all into this

3426
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:00,079
category we called bimbo bud

3427
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:02,159
and they were like you know it was what

3428
01:54:00,079 --> 01:54:03,679
the the

3429
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:05,118
the brokers that were always running

3430
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:07,199
around vancouver trying to buy all the

3431
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:08,479
weed to send down to the states that i

3432
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:09,598
kind of kept away from those guys

3433
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:10,879
because i always thought they were just

3434
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:12,319
a heat score

3435
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,560
but that was the kind of stuff that they

3436
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:16,719
were looking at and it was um

3437
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:18,080
bimbo bud was just lime green

3438
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,719
really bright

3439
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:23,279
kind of white

3440
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:24,880
and all kind of just smelled generic and

3441
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:26,079
you know everything just kind of fit

3442
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:27,920
into that thing and there were so many

3443
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:29,519
of those that were just disappointing

3444
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,359
you know sugar shack that was one of

3445
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:33,760
them there's a whole bunch of them jbud

3446
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:35,439
there's a ton of them

3447
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,599
they were all really just biker grown

3448
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:39,359
hash plants that were stuffed full of

3449
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:42,079
hydroponic nutrients and really really

3450
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,279
frosty but not very not very much punch

3451
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:45,679
to the

3452
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:48,399
you know to their appearance

3453
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:51,279
yeah yeah sure

3454
01:54:48,399 --> 01:54:54,479
so the next one is if you had to be

3455
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:56,479
dropped off on a sort of deserted island

3456
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:58,799
left to your lonesome you can only take

3457
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:03,559
three strains with you what strains are

3458
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,560
you gonna take just kill me man

3459
01:55:04,158 --> 01:55:07,839
yeah i'd probably take a a high

3460
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,760
trapenoline variety i'd take something

3461
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:11,360
in that hazy kind of sweet skunk family

3462
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:14,400
and

3463
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:14,399
hmm it's tough call

3464
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,639
yeah

3465
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,679
yeah i'd probably it's a tough call i

3466
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:24,159
mean it's it's it's that's my nightmare

3467
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:25,599
right to be limited to three how unfair

3468
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:29,198
would that world be

3469
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,199
i used to only give people two

3470
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,800
i don't know cookies og something for

3471
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:34,639
the bitter carry off in class i mean as

3472
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,800
much as i rage on the cushes there there

3473
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:38,880
is a beauty to them you know

3474
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,960
yeah definitely i've i've got a very

3475
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,760
sweet spot for cookies myself even

3476
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:44,960
though

3477
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:46,639
people like to call me a fanboy so

3478
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,639
this one uh

3479
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:51,199
is is the opposite end of the last

3480
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:53,599
question let's say instead of you being

3481
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:55,279
marooned on the island someone you're

3482
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:56,960
not the biggest fan of is getting

3483
01:55:55,279 --> 01:55:58,960
marooned on an island and you get to

3484
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:02,319
pick the three strains they get left

3485
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:02,319
with what are you gonna leave him with

3486
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:05,920
oh man

3487
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:09,359
what can i say do on to others as you

3488
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:09,359
would have others do unto you

3489
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,880
there you go would you give them the

3490
01:56:11,439 --> 01:56:16,799
same as what you'd take yeah why not

3491
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,800
i love that very diplomatic we've you're

3492
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,960
the second guest to have shown that they

3493
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,599
uh have a bit of humanitarian in them so

3494
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:24,639
i do appreciate that right

3495
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:26,880
so

3496
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:28,800
final question for the interview and one

3497
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:31,520
of the fan favorites if you could go

3498
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:34,159
back to any point in history anywhere

3499
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:36,320
around the globe and presumably collect

3500
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,679
seeds or a cutting where would you go

3501
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:39,599
and when

3502
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:41,520
well i would take the seeds

3503
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:44,400
and it would have to be

3504
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:46,719
in the heyday you know before

3505
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:48,238
you know i was born in the 70s so

3506
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:49,679
i'd probably want to go back into the

3507
01:56:48,238 --> 01:56:52,879
60s

3508
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:54,880
and uh late 60s and go to all those hot

3509
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:59,359
spots you'd go to columbia and thailand

3510
01:56:54,880 --> 01:57:01,840
and you know india it was southern india

3511
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:04,000
like karaya area kerala

3512
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:06,159
um

3513
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,880
pakistan afghanistan back when it was

3514
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:11,839
friendly to do so as a as a caucasian

3515
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:14,239
person um

3516
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:14,239
you know

3517
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:19,920
really i want to go all those places and

3518
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:21,359
that's one of the reasons that you know

3519
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:23,359
one of the things i really respect and

3520
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:25,519
love about david is that he went and did

3521
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:26,399
all that stuff

3522
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,000
um

3523
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:30,638
and i get to learn

3524
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,079
as we do all we all do when we respect

3525
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:33,679
and appreciate our elders we get to

3526
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:36,000
learn from them

3527
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:38,158
you know

3528
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,639
and and learn those experiences through

3529
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:42,479
him he had some incredible experiences

3530
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:45,199
traveling around the world

3531
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:47,279
and um

3532
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:49,039
yeah it's a shame that we don't we can't

3533
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:49,840
do that today

3534
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:51,118
but

3535
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,639
we can do things today that they

3536
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:55,598
couldn't do back then too so it's kind

3537
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:57,760
of a trade-off right

3538
01:57:55,599 --> 01:58:00,480
yeah certainly

3539
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:02,560
so i think that just about brings us to

3540
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:03,919
the end of things was there any shout

3541
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:06,880
outs or comments you wanted to make

3542
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:10,079
before we wrap up yeah just much love to

3543
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:12,400
anybody grow on the plant

3544
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:14,960
keep it clean keep it safe don't spray

3545
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:14,960
chemicals

3546
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:20,719
and you know much love to our elders you

3547
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:21,598
know the folks that led the way for us

3548
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:24,319
the

3549
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:26,079
mel franks and rob clarks and david

3550
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:28,559
watsons and all those people even

3551
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:29,519
neville i mean you got to give respect

3552
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,520
you know

3553
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,000
again david says his thing and it's true

3554
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:34,800
we all stand on the shoulders of giants

3555
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,319
right

3556
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:39,119
we wouldn't be where we are today

3557
01:58:36,319 --> 01:58:41,198
without the efforts of so many people

3558
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:43,279
that have contributed to the community

3559
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:45,279
and contributed to the plant

3560
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:47,439
and um

3561
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:49,039
let's just keep moving it forward and

3562
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:50,399
and

3563
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:53,039
you know it would be great if we can

3564
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:55,198
like i said we get legalization and

3565
01:58:53,039 --> 01:58:58,158
you get to experience you know a legal

3566
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,598
regulated system down under and

3567
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:01,439
you know all these different places in

3568
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:03,360
the world that need it europe right

3569
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:05,919
let's make it happen

3570
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:07,759
it's about time

3571
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:11,118
here here i think that's a sentiment we

3572
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:12,880
can all get a hundred percent behind so

3573
