34
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,840
a good minute now very thrilled to be

much Sean of flying lion research for

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,259
joining me today

38
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,359
happy to be here

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,040
lovely to have you on my friend first

40
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,739
question we've been asking people lately

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,659
what have you been smoking on today

42
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:52,560
uh today

43
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,700
we've been dabbing on the lemon fat man

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,439
um it's the flavor I dreamed up long ago

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,020
from the lemon tree days we always

46
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,199
dreamed of something being so lemony but

47
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,359
that actually would hit you like an OG

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,280
and so that's where the original project

49
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:13,620
came from uh Bodhi uh plant more seeds

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,459
finally fixed up the whole lemon tree

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,039
debacle by getting the original lemon G

52
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,939
and hitting it with his you know hash

53
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,620
plant you know pollen like he does and

54
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,739
so that was the lemon hash plant version

55
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,459
two seeds I got to test out and it had

56
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,860
that smell I hit it with the fatso cut

57
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,300
um that I got from finest

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,800
first ever tissue cultured cut but

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,660
anyone I've ever talked to was able to

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,280
hit nice pollen too

61
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,919
essentially

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,219
you know not wrapping any diseases into

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,018
the DNA from making seeds

64
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,539
for the first time available it's a

65
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,580
great tool for breeders really and so

66
00:02:54,539 --> 00:03:02,219
all the progeny have been high yielding

67
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:05,640
and do what we want to do which is yield

68
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:09,239
for fresh frozen live rosin and you know

69
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:11,158
those 90 you heads and have that lemon

70
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,739
terp flavor that's really hard to

71
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,299
capture yeah

72
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,860
and the main reason is you know it's

73
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,500
like you're doing

74
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,260
work all day and it's a it's a work High

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,959
yeah keeps you going

76
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,699
that sounds delightful and I love how

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
many different Avenues you gave me to go

78
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,899
on let's quickly start off I want some

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,360
body love when I was cruising through

80
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,920
your Instagram I saw you got a lot of

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,720
different experience with various body

82
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,439
strains what are some of the memorable

83
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,439
ones to you

84
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,280
um well it all started out with his

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,519
um Afghani crosses with his uh g1388

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,360
hash plant pollen

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,060
and

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,840
basically anything that we've always run

89
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,719
from him for the fresh frozen process

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:04,439
the flavor lingers in your mouth longer

91
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:07,739
than We've ran 20 30 breeders

92
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:12,299
on my farm over many many years and

93
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,680
so many of his things were just everyone

94
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:21,079
asked for it again let's see The Wookie

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,079
orgasmatron was a real winner oh yeah

96
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:28,259
um yeah he's got lots of far out names

97
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,939
uh his jalalabad star uh his strawberry

98
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:34,080
Mill

99
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:36,240
uh yeah just so many winners

100
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,219
love it yeah there's there's endless

101
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,620
ones we could go into you just

102
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,360
referenced you know flavors that linga

103
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,639
and I guess to sort of tie it back to

104
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,379
the the lemon tree I would have to say

105
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,360
lemon tree is probably up there with

106
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:49,978
some of like you know in terms of

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,319
flavors that linger there's got to be in

108
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,879
the top five for me do you think there

109
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,680
are others that are better than it or is

110
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,319
it likewise for you one of those really

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,379
stand out ones

112
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:05,339
uh I mean I always thought Elementary

113
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:08,819
was amazing until I grew the lemon G uh

114
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:11,219
myself and saw that it had no real

115
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,839
structures a nice fuzzball perfect for

116
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,240
extraction perfect for what I was

117
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,819
working you know looking for really

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,100
and then to hear Bodhi worked with it to

119
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,099
increase its potency it was exactly the

120
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,979
kind of seeds I was looking for

121
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,960
um I think the sour diesel cut that the

122
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:31,019
lemon tree is made out of really watered

123
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,299
down the like lemon tree high that is

124
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,680
like supposedly kind of in the marketing

125
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,079
I feel like

126
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,600
so it's just good to actually bring that

127
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,839
terpene so people are like oh wow it's

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,240
unmistakable

129
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,339
yeah and I'm I'm not super up to date

130
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,019
with the origins of the lemon G but from

131
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,758
what I read people say like it might

132
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,339
just be like a Colombian or something

133
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,840
and and that sort of matches some of the

134
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,519
descriptions you hear what's your

135
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,519
thoughts on the origin of the lemon G

136
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:04,198
um I mean it's pretty common knowledge

137
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,840
that people say it came from Ohio so

138
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,180
it's the Ohio lemon G cut which was

139
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,119
passed around in their 80s

140
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,639
and from there yeah we would need to do

141
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,220
the whole you know genome mapping

142
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,819
interpene analysis and then look at you

143
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,740
know

144
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,038
stuff like that and actually deduce

145
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,160
where the actual land race came from

146
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,659
yeah certainly certainly so it just to

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,660
rewind for a moment you were talking

148
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,280
about how hop late and viroid is sort of

149
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,919
everywhere and you were able to get that

150
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,779
uh tissue cultured fat so I'd love to

151
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,459
hear your perspective because obviously

152
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,799
you know being in California you're

153
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,959
surrounded by it how bad is the

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,418
situation in your mind in regards to the

155
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,060
hop latent virus

156
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:50,879
I mean people are finding it in plants

157
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,339
that they think are healthy so that's a

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,199
big like you know scary thought like oh

159
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,119
there's nothing wrong and experienced

160
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,400
Growers are getting lab tests and

161
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,199
finding it's not in the unhealthy plant

162
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,219
it just needed more minerals it's in

163
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,038
this one

164
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,800
so it's just kind of sitting there

165
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,839
hidden sounds real scary honestly can't

166
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,418
look at it with a microscope you've got

167
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,000
to take tissue samples to figure out if

168
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:17,399
you have this virus

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,680
um I mean most everyone in the last five

170
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,538
years I would say 95 percent of people

171
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,579
I've talked to have had to eliminate

172
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,918
their mom rooms and reset everything

173
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,859
absolutely

174
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,139
do you think it'll come to a point where

175
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,180
we have to everyone tries to start

176
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,019
afresh at the same time or do you think

177
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,220
it's just going to be one of those

178
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,318
things that's just going to persist

179
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,539
forever now

180
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,580
uh I think just like anything you know

181
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,318
the genetics are here to adapt and

182
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,839
they're here for us so

183
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,759
like what I did this year putting seeds

184
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,339
out and letting things succumb to

185
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,259
diseases and you know that's the real

186
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,019
breeding work we can eventually breed

187
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,280
away from it

188
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,719
yeah interesting I've been wondering

189
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,239
that one myself but that's that's an

190
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,220
angle I haven't thought of I like that

191
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,079
so just to come back to the very start

192
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,120
of all of this we you were saying you

193
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,159
know this this uh the lemon hybrid

194
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,800
you're been enjoying today so it's a

195
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,599
good work strain I love the idea of work

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,300
strains they're the exact sort of things

197
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:17,459
I want to smoke myself what sort of

198
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,079
things lend themselves to that category

199
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,060
in your mind besides obviously just

200
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,918
saying you know sativas are there any

201
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,500
specific sorts of strains you think

202
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:29,598
really fit that category

203
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:35,339
well it's really the combination of

204
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:38,759
limonene and Alpha pinene being high in

205
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,580
the extract that's gonna tighten up all

206
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,038
your blood vessels

207
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,560
vasoconstrictor versus vasodilator

208
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,139
associated with Indica FX

209
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,479
so that constrictive action causes your

210
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,179
heart to pump harder you feel like

211
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,139
you're ready to do push-ups or run a

212
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,319
mile

213
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,539
that's a great thing when you're uh

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,060
worked all day the day before or worked

215
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:05,819
all night pushed yourself and your

216
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,679
body's soar in the morning but yet the

217
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,260
plants are ready they want to get in the

218
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,000
freezer

219
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:14,639
I love the plates I'm ready to get in

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,559
the freezer tell me more about your

221
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,720
fresh Frozen activities because I'll be

222
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,419
honest I I still have a lot to learn

223
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,259
about fresh frozen what how would what's

224
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:27,240
how would you sell it to me

225
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:30,240
well we've been

226
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,159
fresh freezing here on our farm for

227
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,139
seven years now

228
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,480
so I've been doing it longer than most

229
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,419
anyone I've talked to we've done the dry

230
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,820
ice we've done the scientific freezers

231
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,000
we've done generators in the back of the

232
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,000
truck

233
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:50,219
if I was gonna sell it to you I would

234
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,778
say hey if you're a farmer you only get

235
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,300
paid for the total weight of

236
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:57,299
cannabinoids that you produce

237
00:09:54,299 --> 00:10:00,059
and those finer cannabinoids are

238
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,919
evaporating in your curing room and

239
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,319
that's why it smells good in there

240
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,240
so if you're okay with burning some of

241
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,700
the finest effort that you ever had

242
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,220
every year go ahead and cure your crop

243
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,000
stay in the past

244
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,459
I'll be here fresh freezing

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,100
like a Zen monk I love it I love it okay

246
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:21,899
because I noticed on your Instagram you

247
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,480
had something that I had never heard of

248
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,080
before it was what you called Fresh

249
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,639
froze fresh frozen

250
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,740
pressurized rosin tell me about the

251
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,559
pressurized component that seems like

252
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:39,060
quite Innovative to me

253
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:41,338
yeah so a lot of people do cold cure or

254
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:43,679
what's known as fresh pressed rosin

255
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,560
where they just take it out of the rosin

256
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,899
press and put it in a jar

257
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,599
um this is a way to actually conceal

258
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,799
some of the qualities of your rosin

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,620
because if you know what you're doing

260
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,500
you can squeeze out your rosin and then

261
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,679
freeze it and keep it fresh pressed and

262
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,860
it kind of hides if it'll Char the

263
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,599
dab nail later or if it'll be harsh it

264
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,899
just all looks clear

265
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,120
and so if you whip your 90 you

266
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,278
which is like what West Coast Alchemy

267
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,679
does that's kind of the brand that sets

268
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,639
the standards right now

269
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:21,000
um

270
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:24,838
you got this wet look on your 90u and

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,078
that's the terpenes coating the thca in

272
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,540
this nice kind of achievable quality

273
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,819
where you're like oh okay so the indoor

274
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:35,399
or really organic outdoor from

275
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,100
experienced Growers that'll have this

276
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,839
really wet look because it has a high

277
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,820
amount of terpenes and that's what

278
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,640
people want is a lot of flavor with

279
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,560
their rosin and it's hard to find

280
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,199
a lot of flavor

281
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,179
in rosin because you know only a few

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,820
cultivars work for that process

283
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:56,639
genetically

284
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,278
brilliant a lot of a lot of details

285
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,319
there I'm gonna have to go over again

286
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:05,039
tell me how do you think we can get more

287
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:08,278
of the general public onto these higher

288
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,679
types of concentrates such as hash 90 IU

289
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,740
things like that because I think there's

290
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,359
a conundrum in that like you need to

291
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,579
show people of course but like there's

292
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,379
not a lot of it around so what's your

293
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:21,719
thoughts

294
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,480
well the price of rosin is dropping and

295
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,660
people are learning the fresh freeze and

296
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,180
the collapse of the flower market with

297
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:32,458
the overproduction on the White Market

298
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:35,219
and the cartels

299
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:38,099
has pushed small craft Growers into

300
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,620
understanding fresh frozen whether they

301
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,540
wanted to or not so if you've got a

302
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,060
family and you've got a big grow set up

303
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:47,039
and you've got everything rolling if you

304
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,539
dried everything last year you're still

305
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,819
sitting on it and you're looking at

306
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,219
selling it at a loss if you want any

307
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,320
cash whatsoever before the next flood

308
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:59,060
comes in

309
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,160
20 days two weeks that's it

310
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:04,559
interesting and and with all that excess

311
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,419
stock from the White Market do you think

312
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,819
eventually a bunch of it will get turned

313
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,319
into just like simple concentrates and

314
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,000
that'll have like a big flood on the

315
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,339
market

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,559
yes and that's why all your white Market

317
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,660
investors are pushing for interstate

318
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,838
commerce because we're at the breaking

319
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:24,659
point in the next year 95 of cannabis

320
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,480
companies didn't turn a profit last year

321
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:30,059
so you've either got billionaires who

322
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,220
want to keep losing money to prepare for

323
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,319
federal legalization

324
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,759
so their brand is ready

325
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,278
or

326
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,620
you got to make some sort of lobbying

327
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,778
effort between a state that's just

328
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,879
coming online and doesn't have a good

329
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:47,519
environment to grow

330
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,620
do you foresee that Federal legalization

331
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,360
in those opening of borders happening in

332
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,159
the near future

333
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,019
well it's hard to say there's so many

334
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,679
things at play and so many things

335
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,940
distracting from World Wide weed as I

336
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,399
call it

337
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,800
um you know this it's amazing resource

338
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,539
that can unite the world uh the first

339
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,099
multi-trillion dollar industry that

340
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,439
could

341
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,019
um unite third world countries and First

342
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,839
World countries and put everyone on a

343
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:22,019
different playing field as far as Global

344
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,240
terpene Production and a global

345
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,639
blockchain to

346
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,579
you know honestly take care of all the

347
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,339
logistics right it's like people want to

348
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:34,199
buy weed we have the World Wide Web why

349
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:37,200
isn't it just you can just go on there

350
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,240
and see like hey I'm a farmer I do these

351
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,639
are the soil tests this is my terroir

352
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,799
these are the terpenes that Grass Valley

353
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,240
produces better than anyone I'm sure

354
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,338
there's other areas that are going to

355
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,560
produce unique terpenes but here in

356
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,680
Grass Valley we can produce a wide

357
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,479
variety of nice ones so that terroir

358
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,659
will be understood on the World Market

359
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,060
if everyone can just get over themselves

360
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:02,939
and see that we can employ

361
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,919
millions of people yeah

362
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,360
wow that's so cool to hear I've been

363
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,458
thinking about this because I've been

364
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,379
getting more into wine recently and I

365
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,359
was wondering do you think that will be

366
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,120
the end State we get to where like for

367
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,519
example if you're in France in the Loire

368
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,839
you're probably growing Shannon Blanc do

369
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,278
you think that's what will happen to

370
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,420
like what you're describing where like

371
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,100
if you're in Grass Valley you're

372
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:24,778
probably growing extreme because it's

373
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,339
just the terroir matches or something

374
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,439
like that or do you think it'll be more

375
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,180
variable than say wine where it's quite

376
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,360
homogeneous

377
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:36,479
it'll be more variable than Wine but it

378
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,220
will become more homogeneous but that

379
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,980
will lead to like the Ultimate

380
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,940
Experience for the consumer because as

381
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,339
the real small Market Farmers survive

382
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:50,100
then they'll have to use the lab and the

383
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,339
soil test to differentiate themselves

384
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,278
and have genetics being made on site to

385
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,139
make true land races for our

386
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,980
place just like

387
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:05,399
everyone else has done it's this whole

388
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,199
Colony colonization of weed that's been

389
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,360
happening right like

390
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,939
Skunk Man Sam

391
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
and that whole crew from Santa Cruz you

392
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,240
know I grew up in Santa Cruz I'm

393
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,380
familiar with where blue dream was

394
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,379
created

395
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:21,778
over in last chance

396
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:24,179
this is some smart hippies you know who

397
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:26,578
were like oh wait like these tribes have

398
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,500
already done thousands of years of work

399
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:30,719
to hybridize their unique cannabis

400
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,720
strains they don't have airplanes or

401
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,399
breeding sites like let's go to Thailand

402
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,680
and collect their seeds let's go to

403
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,778
Pakistan let's go to Oaxaca Let's cross

404
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,519
all those together and that's where they

405
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:42,600
made Blue Dream the number one we'd ever

406
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,480
sold

407
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,459
yet those tribes still don't have

408
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,740
running water or solar panels

409
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:53,578
so that's that's the real next step

410
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,940
right the ethics of genetics worldwide

411
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:58,919
yeah hugely you can't deny that um the

412
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,440
the funds are not getting back to a lot

413
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,958
of these indigenous areas I'd be

414
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,179
interested to know in this like sort of

415
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,578
future situation we describe do you

416
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,100
think people would be growing

417
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,959
um like more likely modern stuff that's

418
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,698
refined to suit the area or do you think

419
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,419
certain places will just literally go

420
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,419
back to land race

421
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:25,100
I think with the global understanding of

422
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:28,679
worldwide weed and the market potential

423
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:31,379
and the pharmaceutical understanding and

424
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,440
then that joining hopefully in a good

425
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,360
way it will lead to Labs being built

426
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,820
everywhere where weed has been

427
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:41,519
indigenously bred for thousands of years

428
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:44,579
if you've got Israel a big Corporation

429
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:47,819
willing to buy 40 million dollars worth

430
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:50,038
of weed from Canada

431
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,899
just to research not to smoke just to

432
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,200
put in their gas chromatography machines

433
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:59,640
and genetic analysis machines then we've

434
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,819
got this onus on us as humans to build

435
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,100
those labs and get that information to

436
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,558
those local tribes and we'll find some

437
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:10,259
unique terpene in there that's going to

438
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,019
heal all these diseases that are caused

439
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,819
from our modern society and then those

440
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,679
people will have something valuable to

441
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,240
hold on to yeah

442
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,400
yeah that's interesting we've never

443
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,200
really brought that topic up on the show

444
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,320
but I'd be interested to know do you

445
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,298
think anyone is even remotely close to

446
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:31,038
Israel in terms of their research or

447
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,038
interest in cannabis like medically

448
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:36,599
no no one has the investment potential

449
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,859
they've put more in they I mean they've

450
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,319
only released that they had the

451
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,500
bioreactor last week to produce

452
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,298
cannabinoids without plants yeah that

453
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,000
was wild yeah I was reading that I was

454
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:49,679
like that has massive like scalability

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,538
production and they could just be

456
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,298
pumping that out

457
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:58,379
big time uh it's you know the whole

458
00:18:54,298 --> 00:19:00,359
thing about like the ethics of CBD

459
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,039
um a lot of people who maybe weren't

460
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,500
involved in cannabis grew and

461
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,700
overproduced CBD and then went bankrupt

462
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,339
just kind of

463
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,759
magical cannabis Spirit protects herself

464
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:13,740
from being too taken advantage of

465
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,619
um but yeah but the real goal right is

466
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,740
to have CBD super cheap so that these 40

467
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:21,899
dollar CBD bombs don't have 30

468
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,940
milligrams of CBD they have 3 000

469
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,580
milligrams because it just costs three

470
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,380
dollars for that much now so that's what

471
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:30,418
we want is for everyone to have these

472
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,780
things available so everyone can benefit

473
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,820
and then the price point won't alienate

474
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,798
most people who aren't into cannabis

475
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:41,038
already as far as

476
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,379
getting more people to understand

477
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,599
yeah nice and I mean while we're on the

478
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,280
topic quickly are there any minor

479
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,859
cannabinoids that you're particularly

480
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,859
passionate or a fan of

481
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:56,519
oh absolutely we're having great results

482
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:58,979
with uh CBG uh from the Matterhorn

483
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:03,240
strain from the hemp industry

484
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,440
uh the pure CBG distillate has about 80

485
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:10,319
percent naturally occurring CBG and 10

486
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,840
CBD

487
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,859
absolutely amazing I've been giving it

488
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,038
to

489
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:19,199
all sorts of my friends and people tell

490
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,900
me from all walks of life from all

491
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,940
different diseases

492
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,700
my one friend has a gastrointestinal

493
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,160
disease where he throws up unexpectedly

494
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,779
and then he has lots of nausea and he

495
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,460
would spend a lot of time trying to find

496
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,259
certain weeds that would help that and

497
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,200
sometimes he would and then sometimes

498
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:39,660
the same strain wouldn't do anything

499
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,720
and make it worse and he finally found

500
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,480
CBG he told me every time he adds it to

501
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,740
cannabis his nausea is gone the same

502
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,079
with the 50 year old basketball

503
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:55,500
Aficionado I will call him he loves

504
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,019
basketball but he's getting old and the

505
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,359
joints the pain he tells me all about

506
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,819
how he just can only play for 10 20

507
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:06,779
minutes before his legs and knees hurt

508
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:10,379
and after I gave him CBG came up to me

509
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:13,139
ecstatic you know Sean like the CBG like

510
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,500
it it went inside I I played a two-hour

511
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,020
game I I haven't done this in 10 years

512
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,720
so those kind of experiences you know

513
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,519
they keep me dedicated to the whole

514
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,440
cannabis Realm

515
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,240
yeah that's beautiful to hear it can

516
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,940
give that sort of relief to someone and

517
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,179
improve their quality of life in your

518
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,820
personal experience do you feel like the

519
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:38,700
individual pharmacology is like person

520
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,319
to person or do you think it is like oh

521
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,019
if you have

522
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,418
um this particular issue CBG will work

523
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:49,019
well for everyone

524
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:51,659
I would say CBG has a higher efficacy

525
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:55,500
for most people it does have specific

526
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:58,260
uses just like anything in their CBN and

527
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,980
other minor cannabinoids that do have

528
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:05,158
other you know pros and cons but for CBG

529
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,259
it's I would say the Panacea because

530
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,940
it's known as the mother cannabinoid

531
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,640
from what I've been told from chemists

532
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,460
all the other acetates are created from

533
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,500
CBG within the plant so it creates CBD

534
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,798
and terpenes

535
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,259
wow yeah that's really cool to hear uh

536
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,639
just to rewind for a moment I I forgot

537
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,740
to ask you so I want to quickly do it

538
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,780
before we move on in that future

539
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,460
scenario we were talking about where you

540
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,440
know there's like more Federal and maybe

541
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,600
even International legalization of

542
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,880
things where do you think fresh frozen

543
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,439
would sit in that realm do you think it

544
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,720
would be like one of the top dogs or

545
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,400
still something which is you know upper

546
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,200
echelon you know like your high tier

547
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,538
whiskey equivalent of alcohol something

548
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,058
like that

549
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:50,759
I would say the concentrate Market is

550
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:52,918
growing steadily if you look at you know

551
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:57,480
any of the sales on the White Market and

552
00:22:52,919 --> 00:23:00,360
any of the trends uh obviously to take a

553
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,779
nice dab requires a laser thermometer

554
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:05,759
and a quartz bucket and a torch and so

555
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:09,720
there's going to be a slow adaptation

556
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:12,000
when there's a complicated tool set to

557
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,140
anything like that and so that's why you

558
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,798
see a big push to rosin disposable pens

559
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,659
or cartridges and that technology is

560
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,339
going to keep getting better so someone

561
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,860
can just literally

562
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,639
suck on a tube and taste the best rosin

563
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,740
ever

564
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,740
more people are always going to do that

565
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,620
I mean we had a big reggae show here in

566
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,079
Grass Valley and all the guys who breed

567
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:40,558
and grow cannabis here were excited to

568
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:44,639
be backstage to give their rosin pen to

569
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:47,460
Marlin Asher or you know Stephen Marley

570
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,679
or all the guys you know oh fun my

571
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,240
cannabis thing oh we have the best rosin

572
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,460
pen because if you think about it right

573
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,859
the worldwide weed Market happens like

574
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,840
people want a bunch of pens for like

575
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:00,779
birthday or a party

576
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,240
big wedding celebration oh like we fell

577
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:05,339
in love over this cannabis flavor and so

578
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,798
we're having it made up in pens so

579
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,658
everyone in our wedding gets one it's

580
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:12,000
it's just like natural like it's the

581
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:15,140
flavor it's it's gonna be

582
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,079
easier for a

583
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:23,000
inexperienced consumer to articulate the

584
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:26,939
differences of the Cannabis high with

585
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,940
rosin or live resin diamonds as opposed

586
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,640
to normal cannabis fresh frozen allows

587
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,000
for those terpenes to really tip the

588
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,659
scales of is this super exciting is this

589
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,019
super grounding am I super tired is this

590
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:45,240
cannabis super narcotic if you gave just

591
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:47,158
a beginner you know Sour Diesel and some

592
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,859
lemon G it'd be hard for them to just

593
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,360
totally

594
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:53,939
articulate oh okay is this one's super

595
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,219
racy but with that amount of terpenes

596
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,798
hitting your brain at the right time

597
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,140
without any carbon in there it's nice

598
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,119
and clean

599
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,640
no cough if it's done right right that's

600
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,859
a smooth thing for a lot of new

601
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,100
consumers they don't want it to be harsh

602
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:12,418
or to burn and so all those things are

603
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:14,639
remedied by doing the fresh frozen

604
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,220
Harvest and going through that work to

605
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,780
extract it

606
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,279
wow what a beautiful answer I I

607
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:22,500
wholeheartedly agree with all of that

608
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:23,759
and I've I've got to like tell you this

609
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,159
quick story now because I don't think

610
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,839
I've ever told you this but at one of

611
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,140
the emerald cups one year I think it was

612
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,298
like 2017 2018 you came up to me and you

613
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,980
gave me a dab of this thing I don't

614
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,139
remember what it was but to this day

615
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,140
it's still the turfiest thing I've ever

616
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,520
smoked and honestly it really uh it

617
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,799
really helped me understand how like

618
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,259
some guys can get full into like that

619
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:47,940
whole I'm the Terps slurper dude like it

620
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:50,158
was like the light bulb moment for me

621
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,080
and so my question is

622
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,539
do you remember what that dab was by any

623
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,619
chance and like what was your light bulb

624
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:57,720
moment

625
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,399
let's see here

626
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,038
I remember you had like a little

627
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,240
elephant uh rig that yeah that was what

628
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,980
I took a hit out of it was like a little

629
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,440
elephant I think

630
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,200
oh yeah okay okay so that was definitely

631
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,798
the grape crinkle diamonds yes so

632
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,140
because I you know wanted to be known as

633
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,359
doing something unique in my Lane I was

634
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,840
breeding and I still am breeding

635
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:25,678
autoflowers also known as Rooter Alice

636
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:28,319
for concentrates and I wanted to explore

637
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,798
all the new terpenes that were within

638
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:35,399
that whole realm since at the time there

639
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:37,619
was just blue dream OG sourdy cherry pie

640
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,480
diamonds that everyone had already tried

641
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:41,639
you know along with your million

642
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,440
varieties of gelato diamonds that all

643
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,700
tasted the same

644
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,700
so

645
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,700
the rooteralis seemed to make sense uh

646
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,319
it was totally organic unlike light

647
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,058
depth which requires you to build

648
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,359
massive infrastructure and have

649
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:59,579
greenhouses PVC tarps nine yards you

650
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,959
really put a seed into the Earth if

651
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:04,918
you're gonna Farm

652
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,558
resin which is what I do and breed resin

653
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,919
for the consumer right to have unique

654
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,658
experiences so

655
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,538
yeah that great crinkle really put me on

656
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:18,720
the map because it was you know I could

657
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:21,720
just bring the frozen weed pre uh prop

658
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,220
64. to companies and then they would

659
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,079
make live resin because they knew I

660
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,100
didn't use pesticides and I had a permit

661
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,859
to grow

662
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:30,418
so everything was great and my diamonds

663
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:33,538
really got out there and I heard a lot

664
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:36,299
of cool feedback because no consumers

665
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:37,679
had ever tried a ruderalis diamond you

666
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:40,379
know they didn't even know what that is

667
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,720
so this is a great you know kind of

668
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,299
mystery to explore now that I'm seven

669
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,220
years deep in that mystery oh it's a

670
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:48,418
whole world and there's a lot more to go

671
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,419
yeah

672
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:54,120
tell me tell me a bit more about your

673
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,919
first experiences growing autos and how

674
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,219
it was you came to be like you know what

675
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:04,919
this is what I'm going to launch into

676
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,919
so the first time I saw Autos was

677
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:11,219
2007 and it was right around the time

678
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:14,058
where we had gotten good at you know

679
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,339
selling weed in San Francisco

680
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:20,399
and we had our art gallery and

681
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:21,959
everything was going good and you know

682
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,600
right around a certain time and some are

683
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,400
all the depths would uh sell out so

684
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,079
there'd be no more depths and it'd be

685
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,419
like oh you have to wait till October

686
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,960
for outdoor season you know no one's got

687
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:36,960
indoor in the summer

688
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,120
and this girl showed up and she had the

689
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,600
most lemony

690
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,339
big buds I I had seen in a long time and

691
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,199
they just looked so fresh I was like

692
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,298
when were these cured she's like oh two

693
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,240
weeks ago I grew them in my backyard in

694
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:54,418
Oakland it's an Autoflower and I just

695
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,120
was so amazed of the quality and The

696
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,700
Taste and the high and the timing at the

697
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,579
market right right when everyone was

698
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,720
willing to pay whatever and she had it

699
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:08,460
perfectly and I asked her about it and I

700
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,579
bought a bunch of seeds from different

701
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,038
Autoflower companies

702
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:18,359
and I had mixed results and finally

703
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:21,538
found a good breeder a Fisto from Spain

704
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,879
great great guys I work with them and

705
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:26,339
sent them pictures and

706
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,278
you know made seeds and you know made

707
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:31,019
extracts sent them lab results and they

708
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,640
were like wow this guy really takes our

709
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,679
seeds seriously so they sent me their

710
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,020
experimental seats so I could get ahead

711
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,059
of the whole ruderalis wave so I could

712
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,339
have my own flavors and

713
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,259
yeah I've you know just been surfing

714
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,720
ever since

715
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,220
man that's so neat to hear

716
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,558
um obviously you know mephisto's

717
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,019
regarded in the industry as a really

718
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:54,720
top-notch Auto breeder

719
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:56,700
um what what if the uh the sort of

720
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,380
unreleased lines that they sent you

721
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,600
caught your attention what did you

722
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:04,620
decide to run with

723
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:07,439
so about yeah six or nine months before

724
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:09,479
they released their pink Panama and

725
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,519
their

726
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,500
um

727
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,440
glue strains they're orange glue and

728
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,519
their orange Sunshine strains

729
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,500
um

730
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,839
basically

731
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,538
I had these testers and I was able to

732
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:29,819
breed with them for you know the live

733
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:33,119
resin process and because the THC was so

734
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:35,700
fresh and there was no diseases or spray

735
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,959
or anything because the autoflowers are

736
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,298
so fast

737
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,819
the bugs just couldn't figure it out and

738
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:44,639
climb onto them and so hearing from the

739
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:47,519
lab they would say oh the diamonds

740
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,799
crashed out of your thing in like four

741
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,119
days it usually takes three weeks this

742
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,158
is amazing

743
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,038
so I would breed those varieties that

744
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,399
worked for the process of live resin

745
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:02,220
into the experimental experimental ones

746
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:05,759
they gave me and people love the pink

747
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,980
Panama it's absolutely amazing yeah

748
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,220
that's so awesome to hear and you got me

749
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:14,460
thinking is there like any differences

750
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,460
in like selection in terms of how you do

751
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,259
orders versus females because you sort

752
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,179
of allude like you use the lab to help

753
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,038
guide you do you just also use the

754
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,899
general principles of breeding like you

755
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,658
know this is sort of my criteria I like

756
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:31,259
to see how does it differ

757
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:34,580
well it's you can't hold on to a trait

758
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:37,140
it's like riding a wave so when you're

759
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:39,119
reversing your winner which you're

760
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,620
guessing is a winner from the seed stock

761
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,038
that you've already

762
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:46,500
ran you're making educated guess and

763
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,480
then you're doing that guess with a few

764
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,398
things and so then now you have a few

765
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,440
different seed stocks from a few

766
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,019
reversed females

767
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,000
and then you test those out and then you

768
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:59,099
can compare okay so that has the trade I

769
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,679
want this one doesn't so then you move

770
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,079
one into production and you hold on to

771
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,960
the seeds that you can produce more of

772
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,759
what you want just like a hundred and if

773
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,980
you have that hundred then you can make

774
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,359
more of those ones and find more of

775
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,679
something you like or cross it into

776
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,319
something new

777
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,059
so you can't actually hold mom stock at

778
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,839
all you just have to hold

779
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:24,480
seeds of the winners and basically you

780
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,579
know out of every plant that each one

781
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,200
has to be uniquely marked and you have

782
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:31,879
to like get the biggest seeds out of

783
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,380
there and test those out uniquely yeah

784
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,299
wow you you answered the next question I

785
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,399
was gonna ask which was like technically

786
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:40,319
how do you breed Autos but I guess you

787
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,699
just sort of did that do you know of any

788
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,678
other ways because I I can't remember

789
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,679
who but someone said there's like a

790
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,960
chemical you can use that'll like stop

791
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,399
the plant from flowering and I was like

792
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,899
that's interesting I hadn't heard of

793
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,898
that do you know anything about that

794
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,859
um well as far as breeding Autos like

795
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,360
obviously you can have uh regular

796
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,119
autoflowers

797
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,339
um but Mephisto doesn't really let out

798
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:10,439
regular autos because then it's easy for

799
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:13,740
you to produce a lot of seeds so I won

800
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,620
one pack of white stomper from Mephisto

801
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:20,099
in an auction one time

802
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:22,739
so when you're feminizing seeds you're

803
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,359
using silver thiosulfate and that's a

804
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,179
mixture of chemicals that are going to

805
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:30,658
block the femininity from being

806
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:33,480
expressed and your feminine plant is

807
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:36,240
going to grow balls and those balls

808
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,919
don't have a man

809
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,319
Sheen in there they don't have the

810
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,440
chromosome to make a male so all the

811
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,839
seeds are going to be feminized

812
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,360
so this is a great process if you want

813
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:51,658
to lock in a trait however if you read

814
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:55,139
genetic you know warnings after four to

815
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:58,380
seven generations of feminizing you can

816
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,679
end up in a genetic dead end and have

817
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,080
lots of hermaphrodism and problems so

818
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,019
you kind of want to zip up your Gene

819
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,838
with feminization and then unzip it with

820
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:11,398
a regular Autoflower seed which is the

821
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,799
work I've recently been doing after

822
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:18,418
doing five generations of feminization

823
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,879
now I hit it with male autoflowers

824
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,098
wow that's so cool and then is the plan

825
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,139
then to work like sort of fresh

826
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,000
feminized stock Ford that's not in that

827
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,300
bottleneck or do you want to work the

828
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,418
male female stuff just out from there

829
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,580
yeah exactly once you unzip it then you

830
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,559
can zip it back up in a direction that

831
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:40,159
you want and the direction that I'm

832
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:43,019
going is to make full melt

833
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,220
trichomes that fall off to make live

834
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,099
rosin

835
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:50,878
a hundred percent in the Genome of the

836
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:55,019
autoflowers so once right now it's like

837
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:57,779
60 you know have the nice tacky wash

838
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:59,759
look 40 percent are going to be greasy

839
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,580
still and are going to work better for

840
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,380
live resin and B BHO or butane

841
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:06,659
extraction

842
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,180
yeah wow and I guess while we're here

843
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:11,039
what are your thoughts on some of the

844
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,319
other forms of concentrate like I'm sure

845
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,659
you don't hate them do you have like a

846
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,280
hierarchy of like concentrates in terms

847
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:18,838
of like maybe fresh Frozen's at the top

848
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,099
and then other stuff or what's your

849
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:23,159
thoughts

850
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:26,579
well you've got your BHO diamonds and

851
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:30,358
you've got your live rosin so those two

852
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:32,039
things are premium extracts when done uh

853
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:33,000
with the genetics that they're supposed

854
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:35,639
to

855
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,639
you can express flavors that you can

856
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:42,539
never capture in rosin in live resin

857
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:44,420
diamonds because butane can capture more

858
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:48,239
terpenes in a way

859
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:50,460
in another way a really good rosin has a

860
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,159
unique flavor and a unique High compared

861
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,220
to the diamonds so as long as they're

862
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,799
done right and from the right genetics

863
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:01,559
it's an amazing experience you've got

864
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,079
your you know tiny trichomes on all your

865
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,480
gelato flavors if someone's going to

866
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,019
grow that to an A plus like an apples

867
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,719
and bananas that makes amazing diamonds

868
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:15,000
and the flavor comes through but you're

869
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:18,480
not going to get that deep flavor if you

870
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,820
try and wash that strain but banana OG

871
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,099
and you know strains like that they're

872
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,338
going to make the amazing banana flavor

873
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:29,220
for bras and new consumers love because

874
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:31,159
that banana terpene is so smooth and

875
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:34,259
candy like

876
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:36,358
that's really interesting to hear and uh

877
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,980
what's your thoughts on straight water

878
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,679
hash because some of the heads you know

879
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,079
they still regard really nice you know

880
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,759
dry sieve or water hash to be in that

881
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,859
Premiere tier what are your thoughts on

882
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,040
it

883
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:52,319
so I've been making full melts

884
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,539
um for a long time I mean since I've had

885
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,880
my farm and moved into genetics I've

886
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:59,338
moved away from making my own full melt

887
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,980
and all that but before refresh Frozen

888
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:03,000
was invented we were all about the full

889
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,338
melt

890
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,900
that was the way to go that was the best

891
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:12,000
hash you could get from let's see 2005

892
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,820
to 2000

893
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,980
14 maybe so

894
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,619
you know focusing on strains that worked

895
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,800
with that process and made really big

896
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,740
heads made for a great experience I've

897
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,500
had glass blowers design me you know

898
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:30,719
glass rods and things like this before

899
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,219
dabbing invented so we've had our own

900
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,858
ways to like

901
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:36,239
smoke it in a way and yeah it was

902
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:40,199
amazing

903
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:42,659
um but since the rosin was invented and

904
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,239
since squishing it I mean I've squished

905
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:49,500
my own flower and rosin it's amazing

906
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:51,779
just like how uh you have to decarb some

907
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,820
THC to make it work for Edibles and this

908
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,859
whole decarbing process

909
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,140
I guess it goes back to your original

910
00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:01,920
question maybe that I didn't get to

911
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:04,920
um you asked about pressurized rosin

912
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,780
so like there's the cold cure and you

913
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,460
can whip it but when you have a lot of

914
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,280
cold cure and you're like okay we will

915
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,800
try this people realize that you could

916
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,920
put that cold cure into a vacuum purge

917
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,380
oven which actually you know sucks out

918
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,400
all the air and it's what we used years

919
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:25,140
ago and we would make butane shatter

920
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,420
so it creates like about 90 degrees

921
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:31,440
temperature

922
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:32,880
and 180 moles of pressure similar to you

923
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,380
know out there in outer space or

924
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,900
something like that

925
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,079
and it causes a nucleation and the

926
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,838
terpene separation of the rosin and this

927
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,720
causes a texture change and then you can

928
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,880
load your rosin into pens at the same

929
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:50,459
time you've caused the terpenes to

930
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,559
change and so they're easy to get into

931
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,338
your brain and it's a clearer quicker

932
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:58,619
High when you turn your rosin into rosin

933
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:01,460
Jam there's like that's the tech rosin

934
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:04,680
Jam Tech or there's rosin Diamond Tech

935
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,420
but only certain strains are going to

936
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,480
work for this process there's certain

937
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,119
finer terpenes that are completely

938
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,599
antagonized if you try to make jam

939
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,640
wow so so variable before I forget I

940
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,440
want to quickly ask you just described

941
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,759
what sounds like making a really nice

942
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,980
rosin that you said you know you might

943
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,200
be able to get into a pen I'm interested

944
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,639
to know like obviously the vape pens are

945
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,439
here to stay so to speak there's always

946
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,779
going to be a big sort of casual Market

947
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,820
that really likes them do you think they

948
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,740
will get better over time or do you

949
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,599
think they will be limited at a certain

950
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,078
point just by sort of the design or the

951
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,079
inputs

952
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:44,098
I said this at the beginning when Vape

953
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:47,519
carts were you know first invented that

954
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:49,740
that we needed a PhD thermodynamic guy

955
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,599
in there to really figure this out and

956
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:54,000
we need some Physics guys and they all

957
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,920
need to talk together and you know

958
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,199
there's a bunch of corporations that are

959
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,019
jumping on this and they're busting out

960
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,539
pen so far all their failure rates are

961
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:05,639
too high to you know put your valuable

962
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:07,139
medicine in there so it kind of hurts

963
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,539
when you know you got the failed

964
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:11,039
hardware and your consumers like well

965
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,679
[ __ ] you're like all right well here's

966
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,480
another one you know so it's so wasteful

967
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,598
it's like God damn it but there's some

968
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,699
companies using hemp plastic and the

969
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,619
pressure's on right now for that sort of

970
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:24,539
thing so like they have enough money

971
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:27,720
they've made enough money from selling

972
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,519
us the [ __ ] B grade carts and

973
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,259
they're gonna have a new line in the

974
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,960
next 10 years that are going to be the

975
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:36,660
smoothest ever experience that it's

976
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,079
gonna make it so that more people will

977
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:41,639
dab absolutely

978
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,859
incredible and I mean do you think in

979
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,900
the long term the overall Market will

980
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,239
move away from flowers and more towards

981
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,420
concentrates because as you've alluded

982
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,819
to you know like easy use higher terpene

983
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,380
sort of Expressions if like the inputs

984
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,019
are really good where do you think we're

985
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,660
heading in general

986
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:04,338
absolutely it matches up with global

987
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:08,219
scalability uh global Shipping medical

988
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:10,500
analysis medical efficacy it's just the

989
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:13,019
raw materials is weed right right it's

990
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,820
like the real raw materials really good

991
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:18,300
wheat make sure your wheat is the best

992
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,579
so you have the best raw materials

993
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,680
I love that I love that I think people

994
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:24,720
will kill me if I don't ask so we better

995
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,539
jump into it would you be able to give

996
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:30,000
us a bit of an overview of what your

997
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:31,019
process is specifically for making fresh

998
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,380
Frozen

999
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:38,039
uh sure for like harvesting

1000
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,480
in terms of like from Harvest to say

1001
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:41,159
when you've got it in a jar if you could

1002
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,420
just touch on some of the major dot

1003
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:46,440
points here you don't have to drill into

1004
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,320
Super intense details but just generally

1005
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,179
yeah so it all starts with being in line

1006
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,519
with the biodynamic calendar we don't

1007
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:55,739
work on off days we work on flower days

1008
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,380
this has been scientifically Illustrated

1009
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:01,078
you get higher yields from flower crops

1010
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,440
and the seed oils that come from flower

1011
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,539
seed crops if you harvest them on flower

1012
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,059
days so we're in line with the

1013
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:12,480
biodynamic calendar

1014
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:14,960
and we got a crew of lovely ladies that

1015
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,639
comes and harvest the plants every night

1016
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,800
the plants have to be cold to the touch

1017
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:22,259
obviously if it's overcast then it's

1018
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,820
okay too but you can't Harvest lettuce

1019
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,740
in the Sun and then go sell at the

1020
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,800
market it'll melt into a pile of mush

1021
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:32,098
right same principles you gotta

1022
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,980
disconnect the plant from the earth when

1023
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,539
it's cold to the touch ideally at six in

1024
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,579
the morning right if you can motivate

1025
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:40,800
your crew you cut down that's when they

1026
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,200
have maximum terpene production from

1027
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,720
defending themselves from insects all

1028
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,699
night so right at six a.m you're going

1029
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,439
to have that high terpene production as

1030
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:52,019
soon as the light hits then your

1031
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,960
terpenes drop considerably on the plant

1032
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,940
every day that cycle happens so

1033
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,519
you kind of you know get in there when

1034
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,858
you can and then get those plants into

1035
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,920
the freezer as fast as you can and you

1036
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:07,559
can't put it all into one freezer all at

1037
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,300
a time because then it'll compost in the

1038
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:10,318
middle of itself because it's hot plant

1039
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,619
matter

1040
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:17,039
so you gotta bag up 500 to a thousand

1041
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:19,559
grams at a time put it on dry ice or in

1042
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:22,199
a lonely freezer not next to other fresh

1043
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,619
frozen weed trying to get Frozen

1044
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,299
and make a frozen block and then put it

1045
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,680
in the other freezer with the Frozen

1046
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,500
weed

1047
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:33,779
it I mean essentially like

1048
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,639
if there was someone listening who like

1049
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,740
grew up in a Butchery they would

1050
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:39,299
understand all the principles and that's

1051
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:41,098
what I tell people who are trying to

1052
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,339
learn I'm like look at how you would

1053
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:46,440
treat a wagyu cow in Japan look at how

1054
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:49,318
Native Americans break down a deer

1055
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,440
there's a timing there's a way to

1056
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:55,400
eviscerate an animal and get those vital

1057
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:59,579
nutrients and stakes and organs

1058
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:02,400
backed packed sealed and in a freezer to

1059
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:04,318
celebrate life later and that's the same

1060
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,380
kind of principles you got to be on it

1061
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,358
and you got a big leaf beforehand so

1062
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,460
there's not too much backlog while

1063
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,559
you're trying to get it into the bags

1064
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,900
you don't want a big leaf too much to

1065
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,818
shock the plant while it's alive there's

1066
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,858
a balance there

1067
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:22,318
uh obviously you want to look with your

1068
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:24,960
microscope and see your trichomes and

1069
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,880
see where everything's at and make your

1070
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,220
decisions and when you're freezing you

1071
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,740
write greasy or tacky to determine if

1072
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:33,299
it's going to work for what process so

1073
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:35,338
many guys jump into it and think they

1074
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,200
can make oh I'm gonna make full melt

1075
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:39,779
live bras and I froze all my weed I'm

1076
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,419
like okay and so what did you grow like

1077
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,500
oh I grew like low pops it's a gelato

1078
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,559
cross

1079
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,380
like okay bro so you're gonna see like

1080
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,578
one percent of your crop yield into hash

1081
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,318
I don't know if that's really going to

1082
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:53,760
pay for anything but you're welcome to

1083
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,980
do it

1084
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,560
oh so much to go into there I want to

1085
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,199
quickly ask what is the track color you

1086
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:05,880
like to harvest at

1087
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:07,739
50 milky 30 milky

1088
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,140
um depending on the weather right if

1089
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:13,618
it's 20 milky and it's like seven days

1090
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:15,719
of storm let's go you know

1091
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:17,519
okay cool and is that because like it

1092
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,259
continues to mature for a little bit

1093
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,739
after that or

1094
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,140
uh because sometimes you it's easy to

1095
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:27,059
underestimate how much labor is involved

1096
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,578
in the fresh frozen Harvest just like

1097
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:31,259
it's easy to underestimate if you've

1098
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:33,300
never killed an animal and then broken

1099
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,420
down all its parts into meat how much

1100
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,039
work that is yeah certainly so take me

1101
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,680
back to the process so we got the plants

1102
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:43,019
in the freezers they're happy where do

1103
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:45,358
we go from there yes so now they're

1104
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:49,440
either labeled by strain labeled by

1105
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:52,139
their date labeled with a paint pen if

1106
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,420
you use a marker in the freezer it all

1107
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:56,818
rubs off and you don't know what's what

1108
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,079
you got a bunch of Frozen bricks of weed

1109
00:45:56,818 --> 00:46:00,119
that you can guess

1110
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,280
uh then you gotta get it to your

1111
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:06,240
extractor right so you've either got to

1112
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:08,760
buy dry ice and put it in totes or a

1113
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,799
freezer that you know is frozen and then

1114
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,660
if you're driving 30 minutes you can

1115
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,079
just unplug a freezer put it into your

1116
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:17,879
truck obviously but

1117
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,200
it's yeah it's dangerous so if you're

1118
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,358
taking like a three hour mission you

1119
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,699
gotta have an open bed flat bed truck

1120
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,858
with a generator powering your freezers

1121
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:27,779
while you drive or you're buying a bunch

1122
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:30,299
of dry ice to load into something to

1123
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,940
keep it cold just like you know you want

1124
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,740
your meat to rot

1125
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,659
and once you get to your spot you're

1126
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,818
either going to bring stuff that they're

1127
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:42,358
going to crush up and load in for

1128
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:45,779
gassing for butane extraction or you're

1129
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:47,818
gonna throw it into your cold room for

1130
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,859
your water extraction and obviously you

1131
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:53,179
want to work with an extractor who has

1132
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:56,039
you know good ice cubes good

1133
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:58,440
understanding of trichomes

1134
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,619
the cement mixer you know there's some

1135
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,300
people who do it by hand

1136
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:04,619
there's a lot of options as far as that

1137
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,260
goes but

1138
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:09,358
there's a lot of details and so you

1139
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,859
really want to be on it with your

1140
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,719
extractor about like what your

1141
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:14,519
percentage is and how much you're

1142
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,618
getting back

1143
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,838
there's so many guys and there's only so

1144
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:21,000
much you can do what I do is I grow a

1145
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:25,739
bunch of the same thing and I give fresh

1146
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,739
frozen to say resin Ranch full flavor

1147
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:31,019
and Gold Country so now they all know

1148
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:33,000
they have the same Frozen weed from me

1149
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:35,579
so I've created like a little mini

1150
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,159
competition who's gonna yield the most

1151
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:40,980
who's gonna make the terpiest out of all

1152
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:43,940
the same material and you see a huge

1153
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,380
variance a huge variance

1154
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,000
interesting uh before we jump into those

1155
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,240
collabs because I noticed them and they

1156
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,579
look cool I I've noticed that like it

1157
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,500
seems like you're one of the guys who

1158
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:58,440
I I might be going out on a limb here

1159
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,358
but it seems like you recognize the

1160
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,858
limits of where you want to spread

1161
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:03,480
yourself too thin and you're like I'm

1162
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:04,679
not the guy who does the extraction

1163
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,599
because you need to be really

1164
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:07,919
knowledgeable in that area I'm sure

1165
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,900
you've got a lot of overlapping

1166
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,519
knowledge but is that largely how you

1167
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,900
see it where you're like I can't do

1168
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,519
everything it would just be spreading

1169
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,440
myself too thin I need to have like a

1170
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,358
sort of demarcation of where my skill

1171
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,460
set is going to finish and I'm going to

1172
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:22,639
focus on this is that how you view it or

1173
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,838
have I just confused it a bit

1174
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:27,239
absolutely that you're absolutely

1175
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:31,440
correct yeah I mean I got into hash

1176
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:35,459
before anyone was in hash so in 2001

1177
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,619
right I got kilos of hash that I you

1178
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:41,639
know helped people out in college with

1179
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:43,800
in a medical setting under prop 215 and

1180
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,379
this hash was from soldiers who were

1181
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,359
coming back from Afghanistan and this

1182
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,480
[ __ ] was pressed with a gold seal

1183
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:54,900
probably five ten percent opium in there

1184
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:57,900
you know the these kind of full melts

1185
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:00,420
from the international market uh were

1186
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,280
the first hashes and everyone was like

1187
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,260
wow this is amazing but most people

1188
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,180
didn't know what it was didn't know what

1189
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:09,480
it was about so I've always been

1190
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:11,578
interested in resin production and why

1191
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,818
cultures got into it and how long the

1192
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:17,880
history of all that and

1193
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:20,219
finally when rosin was came around and I

1194
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,260
had already been making full melts and

1195
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:24,719
I knew

1196
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,180
the amount of Labor it takes to produce

1197
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,459
weed I've worked on many farms and seen

1198
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:32,699
many failures go down

1199
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:35,039
so I'm in an educated position to make a

1200
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,919
decision for myself about how I can

1201
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:41,880
change the Cannabis industry space

1202
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:45,599
for the better and it's by focusing in

1203
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,818
my lane on what I uniquely know and if I

1204
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,740
spread myself too thin like he said oh

1205
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,960
I'm gonna wash it and I'm gonna extract

1206
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:54,659
it I'm gonna do all the stuff you know

1207
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,838
then you can't focus on the genetics

1208
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:59,818
right and I'd love to get to a point

1209
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,519
where I can just have more cuts and more

1210
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:04,559
genetics so that I can just work with

1211
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:07,318
that and move actually out of resin

1212
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:11,279
production itself and into just looking

1213
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:13,440
at resin production and choosing the

1214
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,359
best genetics for that process a hundred

1215
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,900
percent of the time

1216
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:21,358
beautiful very admirable a man honing

1217
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,818
his craft I like that and just to jump

1218
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,440
back to what you referenced before you

1219
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:27,179
know you work with these various

1220
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,679
extractors and I noticed you had this

1221
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:30,598
what I thought was a really impressive

1222
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:33,719
little collab box you put together with

1223
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:35,760
a Gold Country resin and what I really

1224
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,519
found interesting about it was each of

1225
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,040
those uh six different offerings in that

1226
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,838
box was like a different sort of terpene

1227
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,199
dominate concentrate so you're really

1228
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:48,058
giving people all the base colors to see

1229
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:50,399
what see what like the primary colors

1230
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:51,599
are basically I wanted to know what

1231
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,059
inspired you to do this because it's

1232
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,140
such a neat idea and um yeah what was

1233
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:57,140
the thinking behind that

1234
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:06,119
so I had the first test at SC Labs

1235
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,280
um with a rare terpene long ago uh my

1236
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,019
friend Alec he is one of the guys who

1237
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,760
started that I went to college with him

1238
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:14,219
at UC Santa Cruz

1239
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,980
so when I first got into the rooteralis

1240
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:19,318
plants and I had my own rooteralis nugs

1241
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,900
I obviously brought it to

1242
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:24,480
SC labs and I was like wow you can do a

1243
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,980
terpene test wow and they called me back

1244
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,199
and they were like we've never seen this

1245
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,838
terpene before at a three percent level

1246
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:33,659
this is amazing what kind of flower is

1247
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:36,480
this and getting that feedback really

1248
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:39,118
did inspire me and send me on the

1249
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,099
journey I am today like just going on

1250
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,579
like because I was like oh [ __ ] this is

1251
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:47,338
a discovery and there's a lot of rare

1252
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:50,339
kind of things out there right and then

1253
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:52,858
like you said at the beginning how do we

1254
00:51:50,338 --> 00:51:54,000
get more people excited about cannabis

1255
00:51:52,858 --> 00:51:56,699
well

1256
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,338
we're at this point where

1257
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:02,219
because the market and the government

1258
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:04,679
don't get along it's harder for the

1259
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,659
consumer to understand what's going on

1260
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:08,759
and so because the White Market people

1261
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:11,039
are losing money and the dispensaries

1262
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,500
are losing money and the government is

1263
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:16,019
making it harder for those people the

1264
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,420
effect is the consumers are confused

1265
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:20,759
about one of the largest growing markets

1266
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,700
with so many products being invented

1267
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,740
daily right and so it's very confusing

1268
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:28,379
for someone to go into a store and see

1269
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:30,358
something called live resin and it's

1270
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,000
super harsh and it's made from trim

1271
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:35,818
there's no regulations in California and

1272
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,059
so they use like CRC Clays and filters

1273
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:42,480
and then blast a bunch of trim and then

1274
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,859
call that live resin at the store and so

1275
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,019
then people have like these bad

1276
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:48,440
experiences right and then the tech you

1277
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:51,358
know the test on the side it's like 90

1278
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:53,760
THC with a bunch of other numbers and

1279
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,818
it's super like

1280
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:00,599
confusing like okay well I I guess I'll

1281
00:52:56,818 --> 00:53:03,179
have the 90 instead of the 88 uh yeah

1282
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,800
but consumers are just getting you know

1283
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,558
literally confused by that information

1284
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,079
because the

1285
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:13,019
government doesn't require terpene tests

1286
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,539
so what I did is I terpene tested a

1287
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:18,420
bunch of black market rosins that I felt

1288
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:20,880
like people wouldn't really understand

1289
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,680
like if they just put their nose over it

1290
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,420
I don't know but if I got the terpene

1291
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:27,179
test and showed how all these things

1292
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,800
were different and how rosin can you

1293
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:31,318
know bring you up help with workouts

1294
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,180
help with sex help with cooking help

1295
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:35,880
with appetite help with all these random

1296
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:38,838
things according to the terpenes then

1297
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:42,059
people could start seeing Oh

1298
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:43,679
oh the mercying that works for me when I

1299
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:46,319
get home from work okay

1300
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:49,739
oh yeah that's what's in papaya okay so

1301
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:52,800
I like papaya because it has Alpha

1302
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:54,239
pinene oh okay and so then people can

1303
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,519
start making these decisions for

1304
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,279
themselves as opposed to constantly

1305
00:53:56,519 --> 00:54:01,500
become being confused about

1306
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,720
THC percentages which have little to do

1307
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,760
with the high or how the high affects

1308
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:08,098
you

1309
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,559
what a great answer and just out of

1310
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:14,099
curiosity do you think that these really

1311
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:16,260
single dominant terpene profiles are

1312
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:17,880
sort of more interesting from your point

1313
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,920
of view or do you think like a really

1314
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,380
mixed variable one can be equally as

1315
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,139
interesting

1316
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,358
so yeah that's kind of the world that I

1317
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:28,980
want people to explore right and that's

1318
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,380
kind of the world that we want to create

1319
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:34,199
to create the understanding of the

1320
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,780
terroir we have to create this language

1321
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:39,118
where people understand that like the

1322
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,420
first three terpenes are gonna very much

1323
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:45,539
dictate the effects and so I got those

1324
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,880
first four on there and yeah most people

1325
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:50,699
were very surprised even Gold Country

1326
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:54,059
himself he was like wow I can't believe

1327
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:57,539
so many rosins are just high in limonene

1328
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:59,880
I thought that GMO and papaya were so

1329
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:02,099
different but they're both

1330
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,260
have limonene as the dominant terpene

1331
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:05,700
but the secondary terpene is different

1332
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:09,119
in both of them

1333
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:11,879
so it kind of teaches people about like

1334
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,318
their nose and what our sense of smell

1335
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,720
is and I feel like that's really

1336
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:17,699
important in this world is our sense of

1337
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:19,980
smell is our sense of instinct it's

1338
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:22,019
connected to our memory there's a lot of

1339
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,838
things trying to disconnect us from our

1340
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:27,659
sense of smell and having this terpene

1341
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:30,599
Kit allowed people to do their own self

1342
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:33,000
research right a bio essay like the

1343
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,039
medical term for how you felt when you

1344
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,199
took your dab you know

1345
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:40,139
like and then people can actually have a

1346
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:42,598
language like oh okay well they can go

1347
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:45,539
into the club and say hey so I Got This

1348
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,599
research kit and this one with mercine

1349
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:51,119
and beta-cariothalene in equal amounts

1350
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:53,039
really actually work the best out of all

1351
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,559
of them do you have anything like that

1352
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,719
and that's the kind of nuanced question

1353
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,240
that will put pressure on the bud

1354
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:03,480
tenders to put pressure on the Growers

1355
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:05,279
to get the terpene test and some Growers

1356
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,519
and rosin manufacturers are already

1357
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,339
doing this uh one company out of Oregon

1358
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,559
would put a little terpene chart in

1359
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:17,058
there so I was really impressed with

1360
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:20,160
that with each gram yeah but not much

1361
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:23,660
explanation about that effect so that's

1362
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:26,219
where we need to flesh everything out

1363
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:28,980
yeah brilliant hopefully it becomes a

1364
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,239
more Mainstay of the labeling and uh you

1365
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,980
can get a better idea of what's going on

1366
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,598
under the hood but you you mentioned it

1367
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,519
twice and it's sort of been on my mind

1368
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,140
why do you think papaya is getting such

1369
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,139
a big Resurgence at the moment

1370
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:44,818
so first of all uh they're dropping the

1371
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:47,299
market value of dried flour is going to

1372
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,300
change everything

1373
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,318
um uh that's gonna push people to look

1374
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:56,940
for cuts that work for hash

1375
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:58,739
and papaya has an amazing flavor and it

1376
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,960
always hits above four or five percent

1377
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:03,419
if you get the good papaya cut

1378
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,460
and so you're gonna get you know your

1379
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,139
economic value out of that and you're

1380
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:10,079
going to get your rosin yields so that

1381
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:12,598
your washer gets his percentage

1382
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,059
and

1383
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:17,640
globally speaking most people haven't

1384
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:20,640
had a papaya you know like it's still

1385
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:22,980
exotic as [ __ ] so when you tell people

1386
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:25,558
oh hey like I remember saying oh I've

1387
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,838
got papaya and you know after saying it

1388
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:30,300
to however many people who come up to my

1389
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:32,279
booth one person's like what's a papaya

1390
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,440
and I was like oh [ __ ] yeah because

1391
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,619
papaya is so exotic some people just had

1392
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,599
like the fruits that they know of and so

1393
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:42,900
it's just it's just gonna keep spreading

1394
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:46,440
papaya and oh and personally I feel that

1395
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:48,780
the high is like you know like similar

1396
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,579
it's got a little bit more relaxation on

1397
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,740
the muscles but it's got a lot of Mind

1398
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,980
engagement and we'll keep you going in

1399
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:58,078
the day and help with sore muscles yeah

1400
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,880
perfect so we've been talking a bit

1401
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,519
about the papaya strain and I wanted to

1402
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,700
ask you about your durian strain my

1403
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:07,440
buddy osgrown Exotics shout out he he

1404
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:09,179
wants a durian strain he's got his heart

1405
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,318
set on it so tell me about yours what's

1406
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:13,679
it like

1407
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:18,659
all right so the durian project is

1408
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:22,318
hitting onion Fritter into the papaya

1409
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:26,039
so uh we have like the Charlotte Sashimi

1410
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:29,460
from tea bezel and that's a good rosin

1411
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,599
strain that gives it a Savory uh terp

1412
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,539
profile

1413
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,519
so if you hit that with Papaya we think

1414
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:38,279
that within that seed stock that we'll

1415
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:41,159
find like the true durian expression

1416
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,480
yeah beautiful so you reckon you're just

1417
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,118
a little more hunting and you'll be

1418
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,240
there yeah that's the goal right now is

1419
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,579
we're trying to find uh the durian and

1420
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:54,000
passion fruit the passion fruit project

1421
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:56,640
is forbidden fruit legendary OG hit with

1422
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,239
bodhi's lemon hash plant version two

1423
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:03,298
and the durian project is the

1424
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:06,899
uh shallot shashimi

1425
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:08,759
and and papaya cross together yeah my

1426
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,858
friend you just made my day that you're

1427
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,540
doing a passion fruit project half the

1428
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:14,880
time when I talk to people about passion

1429
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:16,500
fruit they they don't they like what you

1430
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,880
said earlier it's an exotic fruit some

1431
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,159
people aren't like they're not familiar

1432
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,900
with it and whatnot but

1433
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,578
I've got a passion fruit line I'm

1434
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,760
working on we need to trade seeds my

1435
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:30,298
friend my one is uh triangle pupil so

1436
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:32,700
like TK by Pakistani star pupil by

1437
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:34,920
raspberry Mama which is like a pink

1438
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:38,338
Champagne sort of thing if you remember

1439
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,980
that from back in the day oh I love pink

1440
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:42,179
Champagne yeah right so perfect I'm

1441
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:44,579
gonna remember that I'm gonna send you

1442
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:46,440
some seeds because yeah I too have long

1443
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:48,298
been looking for a passion fruit strain

1444
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,039
and sometimes you get close but you're

1445
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:51,539
not quite there and it would be really

1446
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:54,119
neat to find one

1447
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:56,699
yeah I was just talking today with uh

1448
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:59,160
the village guys uh who found like the

1449
00:59:56,699 --> 01:00:01,980
Amarillo that's what they're saying is

1450
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:04,318
there some females within the Amarillo

1451
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:07,139
or expressing passion fruit some of them

1452
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:09,779
more pineapple so I haven't been able to

1453
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:12,719
find the Amarillo cut I'm doing my

1454
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,480
breeding project here starting hopefully

1455
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,699
before the ego Clash

1456
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,980
um we've got lots of winners lined up

1457
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:23,098
from this year that I've made into

1458
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:25,380
clones and yeah we're gonna do the honey

1459
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:26,940
bananas since it's my favorite rosin and

1460
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,818
it won the ego Clash

1461
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,460
we're reversing the honey bananas into

1462
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:34,558
as many winning Cuts as I can find

1463
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:37,260
ideally if I can do the honey bananas

1464
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,140
into Amarillo I think we'll find

1465
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,660
something there I have the sun Satsuma

1466
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:45,358
sherbet

1467
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:48,139
and the Purple Rain which is a masonic's

1468

I love it so many Avenues to dive down

1474
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,959
before we jump off the topic we've been

1475
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,879
talking about some Australian stuff I

1476
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,720
was interested to know what's your

1477
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:13,980
experience with the Australian genetics

1478
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:18,199
yeah I had one worker uh did come back

1479
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:22,619
from Australia she met an Aboriginal guy

1480
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:26,460
and he gave her seeds and I crossed that

1481
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:27,660
onto like gelato and ancient OG and a

1482
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:31,139
few others

1483
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:33,598
to make Aussie lotto and yeah right I

1484
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:35,098
was gonna ask you so I wanted to ask you

1485
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,200
specifically about that because we you

1486
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:39,359
gave me a pack of the Aussie Lotto I

1487
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,279
brought it back to Australia

1488
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:43,558
um and I think my buddy grew it out on

1489
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,660
his farm in the far Northern Rivers like

1490
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:47,819
near that real hot spot of Australia

1491
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:50,338
like that nimbin sort of area and um

1492
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:54,058
yeah I wanted to ask you do you remember

1493
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:57,480
much about that Australian line you used

1494
01:01:54,059 --> 01:02:01,140
yeah it was amazing absolutely

1495
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:04,920
yeah it had super cool structure super

1496
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:08,338
vigorous growth and uh

1497
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,960
you know drought resistance

1498
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:11,759
what did it look like because I imagine

1499
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,559
it might be similar what I was talking

1500
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,180
about because they're phenomenal plants

1501
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:16,619
Outdoors but it's just the effects not

1502
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:21,000
really my thing

1503
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:24,079
it had the structure of yeah kind of old

1504
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,079
school White Widow

1505
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:28,318
um

1506
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:31,139
you know not anything like we have here

1507
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,960
that's for sure

1508
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:36,900
it wasn't round at all you know like no

1509
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:40,798
no round big buds ever

1510
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:43,380
small little bracks yeah yeah wow

1511
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,239
interesting that's um that's very

1512
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:48,358
interesting to hear I'm trying to get my

1513
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:51,358
hands on uh a line in Australia called

1514
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:53,338
Zoid fuel which was made by these guys

1515
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,440
back in the day they're on the Forum

1516
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:56,940
they were called um the Wizards of Oz

1517
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,519
but I guess the interesting thing about

1518
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,440
this line is it's the only really

1519
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,719
notable line where there's any info on

1520
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,519
it where it was bred from a hundred

1521
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:08,098
percent

1522
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:10,679
non-european or American stock

1523
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:14,220
and it's just made from three land races

1524
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:17,338
it's made from a Chinese Yuan uh a PNG

1525
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:20,578
gold and like an Australian sort of you

1526
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:23,519
know heirloom sativa sort of thing and

1527
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:25,200
um it looks like a real modern strain

1528
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:26,699
like it's one of those sort of like I

1529
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:27,899
think Neville spoke about it once where

1530
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:29,759
he was like I could never do something

1531
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,920
like that like spin together a couple of

1532
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,200
land races to make something that looks

1533
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,240
like modern sort of stuff but yeah

1534
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:38,759
there's this lion Zoid feel it's meant

1535
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,399
to be super racy from the PNG gold high

1536
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,299
like just real

1537
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,298
anxiety-inducing and so I'm like give me

1538
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:46,920
more of that and um yeah I'm trying to

1539
01:03:45,298 --> 01:03:48,119
get my hands on it if I ever do I'll be

1540
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,639
sure to get you some because I reckon

1541
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,980
it'd be right up your alley as well

1542
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:55,078
oh absolutely

1543
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,179
um yeah speaking of land races we've got

1544
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:59,880
a 16-footer that just made it through

1545
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:02,279
three rainstorms completely unharmed

1546
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,838
zero molds

1547
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,660
I

1548
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:09,539
uh had my mother she was going to

1549
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:11,399
Tanzania and I was like oh I want the

1550
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:13,019
seeds you know if you meet anyone give

1551
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,019
me the seeds and she met these tribal

1552
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:19,440
people who gave her real wild Tanzanian

1553
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:21,798
seeds and I found a male that you know

1554
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,679
dropped pollen on like

1555
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:28,079
November 10th you know I was like oh it

1556
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:31,139
opened up then and so

1557
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:33,240
I had my farm manager at the time had

1558
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:36,358
gone over to yoga School in Southern

1559
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:39,659
India to Karnataka

1560
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:41,880
and she got wild weed that was amazingly

1561
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:44,699
purple she picked the purplest you know

1562
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,980
and brought it back the seeds just real

1563
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:49,679
land race from India and so I made a

1564
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,780
Tanzanian India cross and that's that's

1565
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,139
what's growing right now yeah

1566
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:56,460
it'll be done by Thanksgiving

1567
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:59,098
man that's incredible were you getting

1568
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:03,838
any interesting sniffs off it yet

1569
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:05,460
yes honestly I forgot like well I grew

1570
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,599
those and they were just getting so big

1571
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:12,298
and had zero smell and now

1572
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:15,119
wow they are amazing they smell nothing

1573
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:17,818
like anything in my garden nothing even

1574
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,559
close and I've done this before you know

1575
01:05:17,818 --> 01:05:22,019
everyone knows you're not going to get a

1576
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:23,760
lot of biomass or Bud off of it it's

1577
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:27,358
going to be low yielding

1578
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,920
but from experience you put 20 30

1579
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,838
percent of that biomass in with

1580
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,519
something regular and then make your

1581
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:34,440
live resin diamonds

1582
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:36,599
a hundred percent of the consumers

1583
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,940
notice they're like this land race terp

1584
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:42,119
it's amazing I've never felt anything

1585
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:44,220
like this so it's worth it

1586
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:46,980
wow that's so interesting you remind me

1587
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:48,659
of a like a talking point Bodhi

1588
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,480
mentioned to me years ago which is like

1589
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:54,058
just like not not restricted to one

1590
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,519
specific area but in general the whole

1591
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:58,500
art of blending is not really being

1592
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,940
explored that much in cannabis whether

1593
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,739
we're talking about like blending

1594
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,780
strains or blending like cannabis with

1595
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:05,519
other plants what's your thoughts on

1596
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,319
blending do you think it's got a spot do

1597
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,480
you think it's the future so I've been

1598
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:11,579
dealing with blending from the beginning

1599
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,440
since I've been fresh freezing and so

1600
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:15,359
there's a minimum batch size for your

1601
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,220
diamonds six thousand grams and then

1602
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:21,318
there's your minimum batch size for

1603
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:24,058
water hash sometimes 20 000 grams so

1604
01:06:21,318 --> 01:06:26,159
you've got to think about what's going

1605
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:28,680
to work because I have Blended stuff and

1606
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:32,098
then I tried it and I was like oh

1607
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:34,219
dang it I totally Blended that one and

1608
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:36,539
one of the terpenes is now completely

1609
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:38,879
overpowered and you remember those

1610
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:41,579
mistakes because you kind of know

1611
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,619
intuitively like how much people would

1612
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:45,180
have been impressed if that had been

1613
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:47,220
pulled off and then you're like people

1614
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,679
will never know

1615
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:52,139
oh man that's a shame

1616
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:54,118
yeah so there's gonna be winners and

1617
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:57,598
there's gonna be losers and you

1618
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:59,338
basically want to do like your cakey

1619
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,338
strains with like a little bit of lemon

1620
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:04,259
right and you don't want to mix super

1621
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:07,798
fruity unique strains like you wouldn't

1622
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:09,720
want to mix apples and a papaya so you

1623
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:12,960
wouldn't if if I had apple fritter and

1624
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:15,419
papaya I would mix them both rather with

1625
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,940
like a cush mince or something

1626
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:20,338
instead of together because then they

1627
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:22,380
would antagonize each other's flavors a

1628
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:23,759
lot of times they do Dosey dough is a

1629
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:27,119
good background for any of the fruity

1630
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,319
ones wow yeah just even listening to

1631
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,760
this makes me realize like I don't have

1632
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:31,798
anything meaningful to say because I've

1633
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,200
got no idea about this right it's such a

1634
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,538
novel field

1635
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:39,419
uh yeah I mean last year at the ego

1636
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:40,980
Clash a blend one so now that's kind of

1637
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,920
like standard where people are like

1638
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:46,380
putting it on the label like okay uh

1639
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,619
this is my new flavor you know it's 30

1640
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:50,338
this 30 that and thirty percent this you

1641
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:52,260
know

1642
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:53,759
so it's telling you that they're putting

1643
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:56,339
three flavors together that they think

1644
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:59,039
will work good together people have been

1645
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:01,980
blending rainbow belts and Dosey dough a

1646
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,260
lot and the moonbow blending that into

1647
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:08,159
pure rainbow belts so it's like more

1648
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:09,359
Moon bow-ish yeah wow interesting stuff

1649
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:12,118
and I guess

1650
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,460
the idea of blending in general I you

1651
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:16,380
know it's been proven as a an effective

1652
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,960
Concept in other Industries like you

1653
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:20,579
know wine and spirits but but also it

1654
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,759
lends itself as you were saying earlier

1655
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:26,219
to the scale up of massive Ag and being

1656
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,079
able to acquire a bunch of concentrates

1657
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:30,899
and blend them together to make your

1658
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:34,019
Jack Daniels number seven so to speak

1659
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:36,238
foreign yes now that is the ultimate

1660
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:38,880
goal right the one rosin Corporation

1661
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:41,218
right all small farmers were in the one

1662
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,500
rosin Corporation where all have our

1663
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:46,079
name is one legally so none of us can be

1664
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,819
taxed and we can produce the best rosin

1665
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,039
because we all have so much of

1666
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:53,759
everything that we can do huge terpene

1667
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:56,039
analysis and then always make the most

1668
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,159
potent of each of the thing the same

1669
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:01,439
time but the problem is is there's a

1670
01:08:59,159 --> 01:09:03,599
huge variance in terpene expression grow

1671
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:06,358
to grow because of the seasonal change

1672
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,600
of temperatures even within indoor the

1673
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:12,539
outside affects that and the soil and

1674
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,060
the grow technique and the water PH and

1675
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:16,920
so you're seeing a still a wide variety

1676
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,660
of that sort of thing and I think the

1677
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,659
nutrient companies working with the

1678
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:24,059
Breeders is going to change that

1679
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:25,798
so just to bring it back to the last

1680
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,719
question you mentioned working with

1681
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:30,060
Masonic and I saw that you'd done some

1682
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:32,039
collabs with big mace tell me a little

1683
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,500
bit about that and um what sort of

1684
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:37,140
things we can expect from those seeds

1685
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,420
yeah so this year

1686
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:42,179
um we ended up with lots of seed stock

1687
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:44,880
from last year's biodynamic project

1688
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,798
where we tried to you know torture the

1689
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,259
hell out of all the males and you know

1690
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,719
put them next to russet-made infected

1691
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:54,238
plants and the whole nine yards

1692
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:57,239
and break them in half rip off their

1693
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:59,039
balls time uh the days it takes for the

1694
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:01,439
balls to regenerate

1695
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:04,380
we start with the hundred males

1696
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:05,579
and so last year the Wilson's cake

1697
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,100
Crasher

1698
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:10,380
uh just had an amazing Vigor no matter

1699
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:13,140
what you did ripped it down broke it in

1700
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,640
half it still was growing just like

1701
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:17,160
normal

1702
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,159
so I had already had experience with

1703
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:22,198
females making good rosin

1704
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:25,198
and I had

1705
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:27,359
my nice fruity you know lemon fat man's

1706
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:30,419
that I'm wanting to increase their rosin

1707
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:32,460
yield and hold on to that lemon terp so

1708
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,960
I figured the Wilson cake Crashers a

1709
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,239
good project

1710
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:39,359
and with the whole Wedding Crasher

1711
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,759
Wilson name you know and then the lemon

1712
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:43,979
fat man we figured of calling it like

1713
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,900
Owen Wilson or just Owen after that

1714
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:48,359
movie right

1715
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:51,179
so basically we'll have the different

1716
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:53,219
costumes that Owen has played throughout

1717
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:55,319
his like Hollywood career as the

1718
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:58,319
different final hunts as we go through

1719
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:59,519
the different frozen plants of this seed

1720
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:03,439
variety

1721
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:05,940
so people will get to try uh sour Owen

1722
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:09,059
offensive Owen

1723
01:11:05,939 --> 01:11:12,979
uh lemon Owen you know

1724
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:14,880
yeah and um you know I obviously

1725
01:11:12,979 --> 01:11:17,819
I'm pretty

1726
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,699
um undogmatic as far as like seed guys

1727
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:23,158
go like I go to places where I trade

1728
01:11:20,698 --> 01:11:25,079
seeds I go to the seed swaggle I trade

1729
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:27,119
I'm I'm down you know I've been going to

1730
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,380
Emerald cup for a long time

1731
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:30,179
and

1732
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,159
yeah Masonic was just always down to

1733
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:34,619
trade and when it came time to like put

1734
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:37,079
seeds in the earth like I must have

1735
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:41,179
grown 30 breeders my first year here on

1736
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:41,179
the farm in 2015 and

1737
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,179
you know you just freeze them and then

1738
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:48,300
you look at the numbers right like you

1739
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:50,640
look at who survived who just fell over

1740
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:53,640
and all the bugs ate you up

1741
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,739
and yeah masonics always hit above four

1742
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,179
percent for our live rosin process

1743
01:11:55,738 --> 01:11:59,698
always

1744
01:11:57,179 --> 01:12:02,719
and even ones that you know didn't look

1745
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:05,099
that healthy still made good rosin so

1746
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,140
like other plants you know they would

1747
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,159
look uh pretty good and then give us two

1748
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:11,460
percent

1749
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:13,738
so eliminated those and

1750
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,658
yeah so we need someone who's passionate

1751
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:17,759
and excited about keeping the flavors

1752
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:21,059
going so

1753
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,140
pass the test and he's a nice guy so

1754
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,539
there you go

1755
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:26,820
that's all the information I need I mean

1756
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:29,698
I've seen so many people say that their

1757
01:12:26,819 --> 01:12:30,719
seeds are so fancy and charged so much

1758
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:33,238
for them

1759
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,119
and they look good too and then they

1760
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:38,579
just don't perform so

1761
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:40,380
proof's in the pudding you know I think

1762
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:42,179
everyone needs more science in their

1763
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,219
life and less Dogma

1764
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:45,600
I love that yeah it definitely proof's

1765
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:48,899
in the pudding I've been trying to

1766
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,719
factor that more into my explanation of

1767
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:55,439
things but I'd love to know I feel like

1768
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:56,819
that trop flavor is on like oranges in

1769
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,619
general I think are coming back into

1770
01:12:56,819 --> 01:13:00,840
Focus I think they died off for a bit

1771
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:02,219
now they're coming back I'd love to know

1772
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,719
because I think you would have your

1773
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:06,119
finger on the pulse more than most

1774
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:07,920
anyone what flavor do you think is going

1775
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:10,439
to be the next big thing to hit the

1776
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,719
scene and what do you think in general

1777
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:16,738
of the scene at the moment

1778
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:18,179
well let's see I mean you know how Bloom

1779
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:19,019
Seed Co you know you're familiar with

1780
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:23,819
them

1781
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:28,940
yep so I got their drop you know of the

1782
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:32,340
uh strawberry guava Tropicana cookies

1783
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:34,559
uh and their pink marshmallow cross the

1784
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,420
strawberry guava

1785
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,620
but as far as

1786
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,020
um

1787
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:43,859
yeah chop cookies man

1788
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:46,320
I had this indoor chop cookies from

1789
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:49,019
heads that roll who won the ego Clash

1790
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:52,139
the last few years

1791
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:55,260
I I've never seen pink rosin until now

1792
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,760
it was bright pink I I'm telling you

1793
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:58,619
I've never seen anything like this they

1794
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,960
pressed it was such a low temp to

1795
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:04,198
preserve some of the purple anthocyanins

1796
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:07,260
and so it made this pink rosin

1797
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:09,079
and my God the high was the strongest

1798
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:12,840
most effective

1799
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:15,300
for like athletic performance like I hit

1800
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:18,539
this before the skate park and I had the

1801
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:21,360
best skate of my life and then I put

1802
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:23,039
away that gram and would only hit it

1803
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,139
right before I was going to the skate

1804
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:27,238
park Forever After

1805
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:31,260
so I'm gonna be growing the chop cookie

1806
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:33,299
crosses this 2023 here

1807
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,940
that's beautiful to hear and you just

1808
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,980
reminded me I remember that last video

1809
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:39,960
you posted of you shredding it up at the

1810
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:41,698
skate park like it made my day to just

1811
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,279
see someone crushing it on the blades

1812
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:50,879
how long you been doing it for

1813
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:52,859
let's see it started at 14 yeah so

1814
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,760
well that's a long time yeah more than

1815
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:59,399
25 years yeah I can still go higher

1816
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,079
in the air than all the skateboarders or

1817
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:04,619
scooters hey

1818
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:07,319
I'm strapped in I can do flips I'll be

1819
01:15:04,619 --> 01:15:10,198
40 in January I don't know how many 40

1820
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:13,079
year olds who don't have any gray hair

1821
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:15,479
and still do flips at the skate park so

1822
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:18,899
I think there's something to me giving

1823
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:20,819
up smoking weed and shifting my whole

1824
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:24,059
life to the future of dabs and fresh

1825
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:26,819
frozen and if I can be that example I I

1826
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:28,260
am right like I am the living example if

1827
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:31,380
you're falling apart because you switch

1828
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:33,140
to 100 dabs No One's Gonna follow you

1829
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:36,000
down that road

1830
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:38,400
wow before I forget I gotta encourage

1831
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,738
everyone to go to your page look at that

1832
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:42,359
video it's it's incredible but to follow

1833
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:44,459
up on what you just said that's

1834
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:46,679
interesting so so yeah so your no flower

1835
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:48,359
your just dabs are you like low temp

1836
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:50,640
only is there any other components to

1837
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:54,779
sort of this lifestyle you adhere to

1838
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:57,300
yeah seven years uh low temp dabs

1839
01:15:54,779 --> 01:16:00,059
um some you know vape pens no desolate

1840
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:02,699
you know nothing weird only stuff from

1841
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,900
my farm or from my friend's Farms

1842
01:16:02,698 --> 01:16:07,619
um

1843
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:10,139
yeah I would say everyone man uh woman

1844
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:13,380
especially if you're in your 30s please

1845
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:15,619
get a testosterone test get a hormone

1846
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:18,359
test figure out where you're at

1847
01:16:15,619 --> 01:16:21,119
and if you need to change your diet

1848
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:23,219
because you're too dogmatic maybe it's

1849
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,500
time and listen to science because

1850
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:28,619
that's what helped me I had insomnia I

1851
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:31,140
had all sorts of issues now I run my own

1852
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:34,019
business with five employees we have

1853
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:37,679
seeds going to all over the world Peru

1854
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:40,500
Austria recently you know like it takes

1855
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,980
Health to make a healthy successful

1856
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:46,380
business it takes a lot within yourself

1857
01:16:42,979 --> 01:16:49,319
I see a lot of people get successful and

1858
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:51,539
then the next year just falls apart

1859
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:54,539
because they can't maintain

1860
01:16:51,539 --> 01:16:57,000
so you have to invest always with

1861
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:59,760
yourself I've eaten a lot of my

1862
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,520
investments you know I've made money and

1863
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:05,280
then I'll just eat really good food hey

1864
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,860
and get really healthy and then you can

1865
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:10,079
do a lot more

1866
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:12,359
that is some incredibly Sage advice

1867
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,279
which I would urge everyone to take on

1868
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:15,658
board for sure it definitely is an

1869
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:16,738
investment in yourself that's worth

1870
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:19,319
doing

1871
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:22,019
I wanted to ask quickly

1872
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:23,698
if you had theoretically unlimited

1873
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,960
resources or maybe like you're even a

1874
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:26,219
bit in the future where you you know

1875
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,560
there's like a little more technology

1876
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:31,319
than what currently exists what do you

1877
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,500
think will be the absolute ultimate way

1878
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:36,238
to extract cannabis resin in a sense

1879
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,698
because you got me thinking you know

1880
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:40,019
with the the pink rosin you spoke about

1881
01:17:38,698 --> 01:17:41,519
it's like okay that's like the next

1882
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,500
level up they've done like a bit of a

1883
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,480
game changer there so what do you think

1884
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,399
theoretically will be like the ultimate

1885
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:50,339
you can foresee

1886
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:52,319
so if you talk to some scientists and

1887
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:55,199
some extraction artists they say the

1888
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:59,579
ultimate thing would be like

1889
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:02,698
like a cold tube like a cold trap like

1890
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:06,359
without water without anything just to

1891
01:18:02,698 --> 01:18:08,879
conveyor belts and a tube and by the

1892
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:10,079
time the weed the product gets to the

1893
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,340
end

1894
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:17,399
it's gone through pure sublimination

1895
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:20,100
so if you could sublimely separate those

1896
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:21,420
tbhc parts it would be you know we're

1897
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,280
talking

1898
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:26,279
hundreds of millions of dollars and

1899
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:27,960
Engineers but yes you could extraciate

1900
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:30,420
you through sublimination through the

1901
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:33,658
process of the temperature changing

1902
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:35,399
itself rapidly wow and so what it would

1903
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:37,920
it would essentially go from being in

1904
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:40,439
the trichome to just turning into gas

1905
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,420
and then collecting it somewhere I mean

1906
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:45,059
if you could get it to absolute zero

1907
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:47,158
super quick then everything might just

1908
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:49,140
fall apart if it was just on a conveyor

1909
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:51,960
belt with a 90 U Micron screen

1910
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:53,699
underneath yeah with nanotechnology you

1911
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,698
know to separate all the little bits to

1912
01:18:53,698 --> 01:18:58,439
capture the bits before that part right

1913
01:18:55,698 --> 01:19:00,539
wow yeah that's interesting it is it is

1914
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:02,698
cool to think yeah what's what's

1915
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:04,019
possible but there you go food for

1916
01:19:02,698 --> 01:19:06,719
thought I'm really interested to hear

1917
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:07,980
that to take us back to just a question

1918
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,800
before when you were talking about

1919
01:19:07,979 --> 01:19:12,658
growing the various breeders outdoor I

1920
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,640
would love to ask who are some breeders

1921
01:19:12,658 --> 01:19:17,219
who you've generally been impressed by

1922
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:21,020
their work well obviously third gen

1923
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:25,198
Brandon uh all his amazing Skittles

1924
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:28,860
stuff is you know super time tested from

1925
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:30,619
his farm so it has that genetic work

1926
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:34,019
um one of the guys who's moved into the

1927
01:19:30,619 --> 01:19:37,380
Consulting space dragon with matches

1928
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:38,219
always had outstanding genetics

1929
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:40,920
um

1930
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:43,079
bodies or staple guy now he's going to

1931
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,119
be mainstream because of his burner deal

1932
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:47,158
which I think is good yeah

1933
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,359
he needs to get paid he's done so much

1934
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:52,738
work

1935
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:55,319
I mean for so long you know uh

1936
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:56,939
well there's a bloom Seed Co is just

1937
01:19:55,319 --> 01:20:00,000
killing it because they were breeding

1938
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:01,799
for a full melt before rosin that's the

1939
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,960
thing they were just making thankful

1940
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,320
melt seeds and then so they have a head

1941
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:10,319
start on a lot of people right now

1942
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:13,500
um Bloom seed code just took you know

1943
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:17,359
the smoking jacket with cannabis Chris's

1944
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,359
extraction and growing skills

1945
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:21,678
um they found like a pineapple Empanada

1946
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:25,099
Fino

1947
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,100
very specific

1948
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,800
um but yeah I mean I've been put in

1949
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:35,219
seeds in the earth and seeing you know

1950
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,079
who does well like for so long I mean I

1951
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:39,060
was able to give that Aussie Lotto to

1952
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:40,198
[ __ ] because he came to the ego Clash

1953
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,340
one year

1954
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:44,579
so

1955
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:47,400
hopefully cookies realizes that you know

1956
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:49,619
they should start a tribal fund for

1957
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:53,399
Aborigines and grow that strain out and

1958
01:20:49,619 --> 01:20:56,158
they can make a bunch of PR and money

1959
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:57,238
right definitely definitely well I

1960
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:59,279
wanted to quickly ask because you

1961
01:20:57,238 --> 01:21:01,759
referenced Brandon there and in past

1962
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:03,899
questions you reference the ego Clash

1963
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,239
what's your thoughts on the current

1964
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:07,920
state of the cups because I've noticed

1965
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:09,899
like more and more people seem to be

1966
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,719
more excited for these smaller more

1967
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:14,939
organic based events like the ego clash

1968
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,500
and the general trend is that things

1969
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:18,599
like the emerald cup sort of feel like

1970
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,158
they're dying off what's your analysis

1971
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,020
of the state of the industry in that

1972
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:24,779
respect

1973
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:26,699
you're absolutely correct it was

1974
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:28,500
heartbreaking to see because I've had

1975
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:30,119
fun with you there I've given you a

1976
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,679
mind-blowing dab that changed your mind

1977
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,599
right like that's why I went to Emerald

1978
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,399
cup that's why it existed but that [ __ ]

1979
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,739
is gone that [ __ ] has changed and that

1980
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:41,279
[ __ ] is no more last year was The

1981
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:44,759
Ultimate slap in the face of like let's

1982
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:46,619
allow a huge beer garden from the

1983
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:49,800
biggest corporate beer thing we can

1984
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:52,260
think of and let's push all the small

1985
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,600
farmers into one area so no one can

1986
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:57,780
actually see how cool they are spread

1987
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,460
out and let's harass them with their

1988
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:01,738
displays because they're showing people

1989
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:03,960
weed that they would smell in a jar and

1990
01:22:01,738 --> 01:22:06,479
then they could buy in a bag that's it

1991
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,420
let's let's harass them so like the

1992
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:12,479
[ __ ] Bureau of cannabis control came

1993
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:16,199
out there all karen like like super

1994
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:18,000
Karen's like let's stop this are these

1995
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:20,460
guys trading hash or are you selling it

1996
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,679
we're gonna have to confiscate this and

1997
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:24,480
it was like so different in all the

1998
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:26,039
years before and you could tell like

1999
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:28,198
they didn't even know what they were

2000
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:30,000
doing and it was like this whole you

2001
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:31,859
know social media blitz with the

2002
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,920
Humboldt local and got a shot of them

2003
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:36,658
being all [ __ ] shady and harassing

2004
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,219
everyone like we're just people dude

2005
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:39,960
we're just you're the state you're

2006
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:42,719
supposed to help us what are you talking

2007
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:45,359
about like get the [ __ ] out of here dude

2008
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:47,340
like we are good people and we make

2009
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:50,339
seeds we're not the cartel you're

2010
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:52,020
looking for how are they producing all

2011
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:54,900
this pounds and you're here at the

2012
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:57,780
emerald Cup right like come on yeah so

2013
01:22:54,899 --> 01:22:59,639
the whole thing fell apart and it just

2014
01:22:57,779 --> 01:23:02,579
went corporate and there was so much

2015
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:04,199
douchery and so much trickery and like

2016
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:07,679
you could go up to like a booth and be

2017
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:09,719
like oh like hey could I see the weed

2018
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,760
and they're like no like you can't just

2019
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:15,600
smell the hash you can't smell the weed

2020
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,800
like uh like and like some booths would

2021
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,239
be like okay [ __ ] it we're gonna break

2022
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,860
the rule here you can like smell the

2023
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:22,759
weed but you can't hold it or you can't

2024
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:26,399
like see it up close like Jesus Christ

2025
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:28,560
dude do you know how to do business or

2026
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:29,819
do you just like and then like all the

2027
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,500
free giveaways couldn't give away

2028
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:33,960
something free so I had like this

2029
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:35,460
ridiculous penny jar so it's like one

2030
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,380
penny jars filled with pennies and

2031
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:39,179
another one's filled with like nothing

2032
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:41,100
and so you take one penny and put it in

2033
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:43,980
the other jar and so they're like no

2034
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:47,060
here's a free joint saves a pay like all

2035
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:50,339
these wastes of time bureaucracy like

2036
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:52,320
absolutely horrible these people from

2037
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,719
Sacramento who made up these laws have

2038
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:57,000
never taken the time to farm anything in

2039
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:59,579
their [ __ ] lives I wish they would I

2040
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,399
wish that the governor had made it so

2041
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:04,439
that agronomists and

2042
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:06,779
um like people with degrees in

2043
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:09,658
universities within our system would

2044
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:11,158
hire people who knew about plants to

2045
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:13,198
work for the Bureau of cannabis control

2046
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:14,759
instead instead they hired people who

2047
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,219
knew nothing about anything

2048
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,739
and so now we're left with this space of

2049
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:22,140
unelected officials you know essentially

2050
01:24:19,738 --> 01:24:24,859
stopping the largest global cannabis

2051
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:28,079
Market in the world

2052
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:29,519
what a uh apt analysis I guess it's fair

2053
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:31,140
to say you won't be going to the emerald

2054
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,800
Cup this year

2055
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:37,260
no we're gonna do the eagle Clash we're

2056
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,060
gonna serve waffles at the Eagle clash

2057
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:41,400
and then we're gonna go to T bezel's

2058
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:44,039
birthday for the next day and surf

2059
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:46,079
waffles again

2060
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:47,460
beautiful man I was thinking of going to

2061
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:49,500
the emerald cup but I was like I can't

2062
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:52,140
bring myself to buy a ticket

2063
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:54,119
like even the scene has changed like

2064
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,980
last year I even wanted to see the

2065
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:58,079
headliner and this year the headliner is

2066
01:24:55,979 --> 01:25:00,359
like E-40 and all these gangster rappers

2067
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:01,380
who aren't that good so the whole thing

2068
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:04,079
is yeah

2069
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:07,140
gone down the tubes I mean I'd love to

2070
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:09,960
hear in general your analysis and sort

2071
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,460
of thoughts on the current state of the

2072
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:13,920
legislation I mean a lot of people feel

2073
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:16,079
like small farmers are perpetually being

2074
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,500
pushed out of the industry it's it's

2075
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:21,179
hard to have a small scale operation

2076
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:22,560
where do you see the need for change in

2077
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:23,819
the laws what would you like to see

2078
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,860
changed

2079
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:28,679
yeah as I've said before you know

2080
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:31,979
[ __ ] worldwide weed blockchain

2081
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:35,760
analysis of the terpenes to market the

2082
01:25:31,979 --> 01:25:37,919
information the genetic analysis to show

2083
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:41,219
the terroir to show the pharmaceutical

2084
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,899
Industries and then boom I can sell my

2085
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:44,880
specific thing to Israel if they want to

2086
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:47,339
research it I can sell it to some sick

2087
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,199
person in Germany

2088
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:50,699
um yeah absolutely because there's a lab

2089
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:52,738
here I should be able to just bring them

2090
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:54,899
the pound they can process it give me

2091
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:57,000
the magic stamp give it to an

2092
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:59,519
exportation business that deals with the

2093
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,738
state to Interstate to inter-country

2094
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,860
Commerce and boom there you go everyone

2095
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:07,399
gets paid and small farming continues

2096
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:10,139
there needs to be stricter regulations

2097
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:12,000
because like what I said before the

2098
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:14,159
there's no agronomists there's no people

2099
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,899
who are bought in this who are working

2100
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:19,559
within the law so they're actually

2101
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:21,359
allowing for all this poison to like

2102
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,100
come out where people are feeding and

2103
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:24,960
spraying too late and a lot of the

2104
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:27,960
pesticides that are allowed on the White

2105
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:30,899
Market will make for a shitty experience

2106
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:32,520
for the consumer in the end run and if

2107
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:35,219
they're prohibited it would make it

2108
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,020
harder to grow cannabis at scale and

2109
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:39,060
thus less people would enter the market

2110
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:40,739
or fail miserably

2111
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:44,159
so it's this whole thing where it's like

2112
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:46,198
the ethics of Organics can protect the

2113
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:49,500
small craft farmer because doing

2114
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:51,899
Organics at scale will never compete

2115
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:54,238
because it always goes crazy and falls

2116
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:56,039
down on its face because that's not what

2117
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:57,539
it's meant to be it's not meant to be

2118
01:26:56,039 --> 01:26:59,760
scalable

2119
01:26:57,539 --> 01:27:01,800
out of curiosity what do you think is

2120
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,840
the upper limit that an organic facility

2121
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,760
could operate at if someone was like you

2122
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,760
know I'm happy to accept your advice you

2123
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,139
can't scale infinitely but where what do

2124
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,340
you think is the upper limit because

2125
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:13,500
I've been having discussions with

2126
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,420
friends about everyone wants to call

2127
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:18,060
themselves craft but it's like if you've

2128
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:20,340
got a certain you know if you've got a

2129
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:21,960
10 Acre Farm is that craft if you've got

2130
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:23,880
a Hundred Acre you know what I mean like

2131
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,439
where does Craft end I guess and what's

2132
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,079
the upper limit for organic indoor in

2133
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:31,500
your opinion yeah I mean the whole craft

2134
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:34,198
thing and small batch and Nano batch and

2135
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:36,300
all these discussions are you know

2136
01:27:34,198 --> 01:27:38,759
they're great because that's what we

2137
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:41,039
need we need to Define this kind of

2138
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:44,400
undefinable thing that's gonna help

2139
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:46,800
perpetuate small craft Farmers to thrive

2140
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:49,379
and help those who don't want to stay

2141
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,000
that transition into something that will

2142
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:52,020
Thrive that won't compete with them

2143
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,738
right

2144
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:59,639
so I would love it if I saw like uh you

2145
01:27:55,738 --> 01:28:01,439
know a five acre cap right and like yeah

2146
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:03,119
if you've ever seen five acres of

2147
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:07,138
production like it doesn't look anything

2148
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:10,319
small or craft I mean I've seen 3.5

2149
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:12,840
Acres that looks insane like a wall to

2150
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,880
what 3.5 Acres takes a hundred people

2151
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:17,880
so like how many employees do you have

2152
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,760
to manage like when is it small craft I

2153
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,679
feel like once you go above like

2154
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,900
like

2155
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:27,420
if you get to like 20 people

2156
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:29,339
to like run the farm

2157
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:31,319
that's not a small craft Farm you're

2158
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:33,239
having team meetings you've got multiple

2159
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:34,559
employees you've got multiple shift

2160
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:36,658
managers

2161
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,620
you know what I mean

2162
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:42,899
like it's big that's bigger it's hard to

2163
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:45,420
yeah it's hard to like if like 10 people

2164
01:28:42,899 --> 01:28:47,279
can like manage all that and then have a

2165
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:49,319
crew come in and harvest then [ __ ] more

2166
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,899
power to them right

2167
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:54,179
but yeah the small craft farmer will

2168
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:57,000
always be defined because that's what it

2169
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:59,399
is like you can just literally test all

2170
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,260
the stuff and see that anything big does

2171
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:03,299
not make the good terpenes anything fit

2172
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,800
all the salts doesn't have all the fancy

2173
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:07,039
terpenes

2174
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,600
so I think it's more about the market

2175
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:12,658
understanding what it needs and thus

2176
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,280
demanding that and then the mar all the

2177
01:29:12,658 --> 01:29:16,019
people who produce will have to flex to

2178
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:18,300
that or realize that they can't Flex to

2179
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:20,580
that and try something else

2180
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:23,060
instead of competing with us

2181
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:25,439
we haven't spoke about it much yet but

2182
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:28,500
obviously you know you're an organic

2183
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:30,479
biodynamic guy tell me what's the

2184
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,520
difference between like synthetic or

2185
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:34,979
salt-based concentrates what's the thing

2186
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:38,639
you notice is the difference

2187
01:29:34,979 --> 01:29:41,579
so my friend uh started growth science

2188
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,859
nutrients they have an organic line and

2189
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:46,559
a

2190
01:29:42,859 --> 01:29:49,079
conventional line or synthetic line and

2191
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:51,420
yeah I ran my auto flowers I had the

2192
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:53,460
opportunity to run the same strain

2193
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:56,880
completely organic and completely

2194
01:29:53,460 --> 01:30:00,179
synthetic freeze the material label it

2195
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:03,060
extract it and the synthetic material

2196
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:07,079
made larger diamonds less terpenes and

2197
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:10,139
considerably less yield 1.5 percent out

2198
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:12,840
of the total biomass weight however the

2199
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:16,619
biomass growth was at least

2200
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:20,219
40 to 30 percent more

2201
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:23,698
so the Organics grew smaller had smaller

2202
01:30:20,219 --> 01:30:27,359
flowering sites extremely like

2203
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:30,238
3.5 and 4 percent yield versus a 1.5

2204
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:34,619
percent yield on your fresh Frozen

2205
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:37,259
and smaller diamonds more terpenes

2206
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:39,779
interesting interesting I mean a lot of

2207
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:41,880
people would sort of say that that's

2208
01:30:39,779 --> 01:30:44,340
that's very much in line with sort of

2209
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:46,679
the conventional things we hear in terms

2210
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:49,199
of Organics you know maybe yields a

2211
01:30:46,679 --> 01:30:50,880
little less but higher quality you know

2212
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:53,579
definitely

2213
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,739
and I wanted to ask you because you're

2214
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:58,198
so involved in the the sort of

2215
01:30:55,738 --> 01:31:00,658
concentrates realm does that spill over

2216
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:03,960
for you into the Edibles Realm

2217
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:07,799
absolutely yeah we've been making you

2218
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:10,439
know chocolates and gummies and taffies

2219
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:13,380
I've been making chocolates for what 20

2220
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:15,238
years now so I've always made Edibles

2221
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,159
and loved the infusion and the

2222
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:20,039
difference between the edible High and

2223
01:31:17,158 --> 01:31:22,019
the dabbing or smoking High

2224
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:24,119
that's Incredibles I want to know what's

2225
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:26,880
your go-to edible I've just recently

2226
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:29,300
gained a better appreciation for them so

2227
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:32,579
I'd love to hear what's your favorite

2228
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:35,760
uh so when you make like you know rosin

2229
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:37,738
you get like the 45 you is like the food

2230
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,079
grade you know and then like there's the

2231
01:31:37,738 --> 01:31:43,079
90 you which is like the like dabbing

2232
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,939
grade and like 120 is like still dabbing

2233
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:46,920
grade so there's a few grades right but

2234
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:49,019
when you make rosin you have some like

2235
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:51,060
food grade where it could you know

2236
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:53,340
collect some particulates or some plant

2237
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:54,780
matter and stuff like that but mostly

2238
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,940
the process is down where it doesn't

2239
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:58,738
have anything like that and it's still a

2240
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:01,019
smooth smoke it's just not you know as

2241
01:31:58,738 --> 01:32:04,678
potent right so that's what we would use

2242
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:08,159
for our Edibles and uh the Gold Country

2243
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:11,399
collab we did came out really good so we

2244
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:14,879
like send you know all this 40 you rosin

2245
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:17,879
down to these Master Bakers in La uh

2246
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,340
honey and uh honey chocolates company

2247
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:23,460
and the um

2248
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:25,440
Starfire Edibles people and then they

2249
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:26,939
you know use half of the rosin for their

2250
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:28,919
Edibles and then they make a bunch of

2251
01:32:26,939 --> 01:32:31,738
Edibles with the other half with us and

2252
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:34,139
then send it packaged back

2253
01:32:31,738 --> 01:32:38,099
so then essentially we have all these

2254
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:42,000
like Gourmet donuts and vegan donuts and

2255
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:44,520
handmade marshmallows handmade wipes

2256
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,899
pumpkin pumpkin spice chocolates all

2257
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,360
with rosin

2258
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:52,679
and they'll send back 15 flavors of

2259
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:55,920
chocolates 17 flavors of donuts

2260
01:32:52,679 --> 01:33:00,420
wow what a what a plethora do you find

2261
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:02,219
that um you get different effects based

2262
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:04,739
on the strain input or by the point

2263
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:08,779
where you're at like a donut it's it's

2264
01:33:04,738 --> 01:33:08,779
more of a homogeneous sort of feeling

2265
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:14,100
so this is a big discussion right now

2266
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:16,800
with all the edible makers and all the

2267
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,960
rosin guys big time I'm really glad you

2268
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,840
asked this because I have a particular

2269
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,600
perspective so the rumor is it's not

2270
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,460
confirmed Is that West Coast Alchemy to

2271
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,079
achieve their wet look on a hundred

2272
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:31,560
percent of their 90 you not all

2273
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:35,279
cultivars will you know release a 90 you

2274
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:39,360
that looks wet is that they do a terpene

2275
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:41,399
separation on the 40u and some cultivars

2276
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:43,619
produce amazing terpenes that are caught

2277
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:46,019
in the 40u bag when you're making live

2278
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:50,340
rosin and making bubble hash

2279
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:54,239
and so basically you can put

2280
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:56,880
the 40u and squish it for like six hours

2281
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:59,698
at super low temp and put it at an angle

2282
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,739
and you'll you'll separate all the Terps

2283
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:05,219
will drip out into a jar

2284
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:07,319
and the thca will be left

2285
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:09,658
and you can take those terpenes and then

2286
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:12,539
add it to your 90u and now your 90u

2287
01:34:09,658 --> 01:34:14,039
looks super wet and glistens

2288
01:34:12,539 --> 01:34:16,560
and so

2289
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:18,960
basically most cooking processes are

2290
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:22,800
going to destroy your volatile terpenes

2291
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:26,399
so all these strain specific terpene we

2292
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:28,560
put the rosin in there I'm like nah like

2293
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:30,960
I've made gummies okay I've made them

2294
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:33,120
with all this and I know about terpenes

2295
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,800
and volatilization so when you're

2296
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:36,539
boiling that sugar mixture to make your

2297
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,619
gummies all the terpenes are gone

2298
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:40,380
they're gone

2299
01:34:37,619 --> 01:34:42,899
so it doesn't make any sense for the

2300
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:45,480
rosin makers to do it other than that

2301
01:34:42,899 --> 01:34:46,859
it's extra work so it's lazy so it's

2302
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:48,359
like you have a bunch of four to you

2303
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:50,219
just give it to the edible maker and

2304
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:52,019
then give me some edibles back and I can

2305
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:54,420
call it the strain that it is

2306
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:57,300
but really they should be separating the

2307
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:59,940
terpenes so that people can dab that

2308
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:02,639
and then giving the edible makers pure

2309
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:04,500
decarbed thca

2310
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:07,679
interesting interesting and I guess

2311
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:10,859
maybe the underlying question behind the

2312
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:14,219
last question was do you think that the

2313
01:35:10,859 --> 01:35:16,380
terpenes for the most part are what

2314
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:18,000
dictates the effect like do you think if

2315
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:20,340
you stripped it all away and you've just

2316
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,738
got the THC percent there and maybe a

2317
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:26,000
few minor cannabinoids that it's all

2318
01:35:22,738 --> 01:35:27,779
going to seem quite generic

2319
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,020
absolutely

2320
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:32,279
brilliant I love it I love it okay so I

2321
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:34,380
wanted to ask you I'm surprised I

2322
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:37,079
haven't asked already what's the most

2323
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:41,039
unique Terps you've ever come across

2324
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:43,439
so the unique terpene that I found

2325
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,539
um was when my mom was over in Amsterdam

2326
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:49,019
getting me some rooteralis seeds and she

2327
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:53,639
actually got me unfeminized ruderalis on

2328
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:59,639
accident some CBD one to one ruderalis

2329
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:59,639
seeds and we bred that into mephistos

2330
01:35:59,658 --> 01:36:06,599
and I brought that to the lab and they

2331
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:09,178
found uh this terpene called borneol

2332
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,460
as the dominant terpene and they had

2333
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:16,260
never found this before and they had

2334
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:17,760
just had a meta data scientist plot all

2335
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:19,679
15

2336
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,560
000 successful terpene tests that they

2337
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:25,199
have done on cannabis into a chart to

2338
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:27,659
show them and they showed me how almost

2339
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:29,339
80 percent is Mercy and dominant and

2340
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:31,920
then there's some Piney ones and some

2341
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,380
jack ones and a few others and how mine

2342
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,960
was like they've never seen borneol at

2343
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:40,699
3.3 percent as the dominant terpene had

2344
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:44,340
always been a super super small amount

2345
01:36:40,698 --> 01:36:47,939
0.0001 or 01 or in other cannabis so

2346
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:49,739
that really sent me on my whole thing uh

2347
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:52,439
recently I've seen lab results for the

2348
01:36:49,738 --> 01:36:54,959
cranberry Skittles cross and it's got

2349
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:57,658
some high amounts of eucalyptol which

2350
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:59,760
I'm absolutely in love with this flavor

2351
01:36:57,658 --> 01:37:01,619
of like I feel like that's a good

2352
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,780
Australia kind of thing right if we can

2353
01:37:01,619 --> 01:37:05,579
get the cranberry Z there grow it under

2354
01:37:03,779 --> 01:37:07,500
eucalyptus will it express more

2355
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:09,079
eucalyptol I think so so

2356
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,698
so

2357
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:13,738
I love it that's the Mad scientists

2358
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,779
experiments we gotta we gotta make them

2359
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:19,259
happen yeah so

2360
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:21,300
I guess I'd love to hear like what uh

2361
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:23,880
what's your advice for someone who wants

2362
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:25,199
to get into breeding some Autos is there

2363
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,060
anything you wish you could tell

2364
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:28,259
yourself looking back with what you know

2365
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:31,199
now

2366
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:32,219
always save 10 C's of everything that

2367
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,259
you grow

2368
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:36,239
so that if you grow everything out and

2369
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:37,980
you find a winner and your pollination

2370
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:40,638
is not successful you haven't lost that

2371
01:37:37,979 --> 01:37:40,638
line forever

2372
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:47,158
um yeah and then always unzip and zip so

2373
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:48,719
feminize one year and then unfeminize

2374
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:52,619
the next year

2375
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:55,079
and know what to look for in males and

2376
01:37:52,619 --> 01:37:59,420
time your mails stress your males look

2377
01:37:55,079 --> 01:38:01,260
up close at the trichomes of your males

2378
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:03,300
and

2379
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:05,340
keep track of everything that's the

2380
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,900
hardest part yeah because if you have

2381
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:09,500
seeds that don't get labeled they're

2382
01:38:06,899 --> 01:38:09,500
like ah

2383
01:38:09,539 --> 01:38:14,460
it's a lot to keep track of that's great

2384
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:16,800
advice I'd love to follow up what's your

2385
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:18,179
characteristics for picking an auto mall

2386
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,219
because you just mentioned some of them

2387
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:22,739
have resin like do you do you put a lot

2388
01:38:20,219 --> 01:38:25,079
of weight or emphasis on that in terms

2389
01:38:22,738 --> 01:38:27,119
of that smell being a trait passes on or

2390
01:38:25,079 --> 01:38:30,300
is it more complex

2391
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:33,658
so I'm looking at branching I'm looking

2392
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:35,639
at how many ball sacks and how close

2393
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:39,899
together the ball sacks are growing and

2394
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:42,119
the internodal and the Vigor and when

2395
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:44,039
you're feminizing you know oftentimes if

2396
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:45,539
you know the seed is a winner and you

2397
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:48,479
like know it's from an established

2398
01:38:45,539 --> 01:38:50,158
breeder who's won awards and you spent a

2399
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:52,138
bunch of money on like five [ __ ]

2400
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:54,719
seeds and you want to make more

2401
01:38:52,139 --> 01:38:57,779
basically you just want to look for the

2402
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:00,560
first one that expresses sexuality

2403
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:03,359
the first one that expresses that hair

2404
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:06,840
you [ __ ] take that separately and you

2405
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:08,880
spray that down and start reversing her

2406
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,340
that's the secret

2407
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:14,480
wow yeah that makes sense I like that a

2408
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:17,699
lot okay so just so I understand it

2409
01:39:14,479 --> 01:39:20,519
basically all auto strains more or less

2410
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:23,039
like are exactly what you've described

2411
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:24,780
where like you have to just test out the

2412
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:26,819
progeny and you don't really get to know

2413
01:39:24,779 --> 01:39:28,439
because the parents get burnt off in the

2414
01:39:26,819 --> 01:39:31,259
process

2415
01:39:28,439 --> 01:39:33,359
yes and breeding long season into

2416
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:35,699
autoflowers is five generation four

2417
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:38,158
generation process because it's a

2418
01:39:35,698 --> 01:39:40,738
recessive trait so like I hit something

2419
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:43,319
you know male with an Autoflower and

2420
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:46,079
only ten percent maybe five percent will

2421
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:48,960
be Autoflower out of that seed stock the

2422
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:51,658
first F1 generation

2423
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,279
and then would you just F2 them for a

2424
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:55,379
bunch more Generations until you go

2425
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,179
close to a hundred percent or how would

2426
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,579
you go from that F1 cross to the point

2427
01:39:57,179 --> 01:40:01,399
of being like hey I've now got gelato

2428
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:04,198
Auto

2429
01:40:01,399 --> 01:40:06,658
so basically you would have to start out

2430
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:08,219
with some Autoflower that you had right

2431
01:40:06,658 --> 01:40:10,500
and then hit it with something you

2432
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:13,500
wanted and

2433
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:16,198
that first generation of those seeds you

2434
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:18,359
basically would kill off 90 of the seed

2435
01:40:16,198 --> 01:40:19,979
stock because you can tell that it's not

2436
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:22,079
going to Autoflower within the timing

2437
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:24,479
right so you're just like casting hello

2438
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:26,579
seeds being like oh this is going long

2439
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:29,399
kill it you know

2440
01:40:26,579 --> 01:40:31,559
so one out of ten is gonna like go quick

2441
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:34,259
right and so then you either have your

2442
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:36,360
feminized pollen ready to paint on or

2443
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:38,159
you're feminizing something actively so

2444
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:40,559
that it ties up with that release so the

2445
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:43,259
ovum and everything's ready so you can

2446
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:46,380
make some seeds but it's not easy that's

2447
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:48,179
why feminist autoflowers are expensive I

2448
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,639
mean I've done successful runs three

2449
01:40:48,179 --> 01:40:53,279
times in a row and then I failed three

2450
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:55,920
times in a row afterwards and each time

2451
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:58,920
a unique thing happened that stopped me

2452
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,960
and it was so unique that it I couldn't

2453
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:02,359
you know perceive that it was going to

2454
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,939
happen

2455
01:41:02,359 --> 01:41:08,219
wow okay and and do you think by four or

2456
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:10,138
five generations you could have pretty

2457
01:41:08,219 --> 01:41:12,239
reasonable certainty that when you do

2458
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:14,579
the Femme reversal to sort of make the

2459
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:16,019
seeds you plan to sell that they're all

2460
01:41:14,579 --> 01:41:17,158
going to be auto four or five

2461
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:18,120
generations

2462
01:41:17,158 --> 01:41:22,198
yeah

2463
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:24,599
absolutely yes I do you know 1000c 2000

2464
01:41:22,198 --> 01:41:27,658
C tests before I release them so that

2465
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:29,940
there's no Herms and no Autos absolutely

2466
01:41:27,658 --> 01:41:31,859
that's brilliant and what do you think

2467
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:33,238
in general is going to be the future of

2468
01:41:31,859 --> 01:41:36,059
autos because there's obviously this

2469
01:41:33,238 --> 01:41:38,638
ongoing discussion about like is it ever

2470
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:40,020
going to be as good as a photo like

2471
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,940
what's your thoughts do you think we're

2472
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:44,639
almost there and what do you foresee

2473
01:41:41,939 --> 01:41:46,919
them doing primarily in the future as

2474
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,679
like a tool

2475
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:51,840
so I had this uh responded to this post

2476
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:54,500
dungeon Vault genetics who I really like

2477
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:56,940
all this work and stuff he posted like

2478
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:58,618
why does everyone grow out of like he's

2479
01:41:56,939 --> 01:41:59,698
actually grown my Autos he likes him but

2480
01:41:58,618 --> 01:42:01,198
he was just like posing this question

2481
01:41:59,698 --> 01:42:02,399
why are people grow Autos if like

2482
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:04,919
everything else is so much better and

2483
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:07,019
they're so much better weed and I was

2484
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,239
like well if you feel that way sounds

2485
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:11,340
like a business opportunity to me sounds

2486
01:42:09,238 --> 01:42:13,379
like a consumer opportunity to me if

2487
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:15,119
consumers are constantly disappointed by

2488
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:17,340
autoflowers sounds like someone hasn't

2489
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:20,519
done the [ __ ] work and I'm willing to

2490
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:22,920
do that work so hey let's do it and

2491
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:25,619
let's use the lab right like that's how

2492
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:29,399
Mephisto got famous is they got a cut of

2493
01:42:25,618 --> 01:42:31,559
the first lab tested proven above 22 THC

2494
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:33,118
to reverse into Auto that's literally

2495
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,340
how they did it they didn't do it with

2496
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:37,920
[ __ ] magic they got the first lab

2497
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:40,079
tested cut that was above 20 back in the

2498
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,319
day when you couldn't find that

2499
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:45,840
you mean they're Auto tested at that or

2500
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:48,840
they use that as a mother stock

2501
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,760
yes exactly to make their first Auto to

2502
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,619
get away from all these low percentage

2503
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:54,000
Autos that were all made from Low Rider

2504
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:56,219
and everyone had a bad taste in their

2505
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,800
mouth and Autos they

2506
01:42:56,219 --> 01:43:00,539
got what I can't remember what it's like

2507
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,219
one of the oldest guys you've had them

2508
01:43:00,539 --> 01:43:04,198
on your show too

2509
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:09,300
um he passed away recently

2510
01:43:04,198 --> 01:43:10,919
um bog yeah bog bog yeah so yeah so they

2511
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:13,980
that's how they made their first Autos

2512
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:16,079
was a bog and a ruderalis that was not a

2513
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:18,118
um you know the shitty ones from before

2514
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:20,000
and then they reversed his four

2515
01:43:18,118 --> 01:43:22,500
generations to make their first thing

2516
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,319
yeah wow what cool backstory I didn't

2517
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:27,719
know that and um I'd be curious to hear

2518
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:29,759
your thoughts on low rider in general

2519
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:31,920
you know because you don't really hear

2520
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,719
much from that dude who made it I forget

2521
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,980
his name um but yeah what's your

2522
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:36,779
thoughts on it

2523
01:43:34,979 --> 01:43:38,939
well it's just like the best he could do

2524
01:43:36,779 --> 01:43:41,639
at the time before gastromatography and

2525
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:44,939
testing so then it just didn't have ever

2526
01:43:41,639 --> 01:43:46,560
above 12 Tac so no one really wanted to

2527
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:48,839
grow it once people started to see what

2528
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:51,000
potency was and figure out light depth

2529
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:53,100
it's like no [ __ ] reason but it had

2530
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,800
its place for a couple years but as soon

2531
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:59,039
as they figured out up above 20 THC in

2532
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,539
autosin it's on and everyone was blown

2533
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:02,100
away when I would bring it to the lab

2534
01:44:00,539 --> 01:44:04,500
and they were like this isn't light up

2535
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:06,360
like what they were so impressed to make

2536
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:08,460
diamonds out of this stuff and you know

2537
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:10,679
all the guys who work at the lab they

2538
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:12,239
run through thousands of pounds of

2539
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:14,158
material so whenever they see mine

2540
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:16,079
they're like oh look at this a unique

2541
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:18,118
smell I love this Ritter Alice it's got

2542
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:21,539
the fresh rain turp it's got the fresh

2543
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:23,819
you know this terp oh wow

2544
01:44:21,539 --> 01:44:25,679
well and do you think that stock the low

2545
01:44:23,819 --> 01:44:27,599
rider was unfortunately like backed into

2546
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:29,699
a corner in that it would be hard to

2547
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,820
salvage it so to speak

2548
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:34,678
exactly like I've abandoned many of my

2549
01:44:32,819 --> 01:44:36,238
genetics already you know because I

2550
01:44:34,679 --> 01:44:38,639
marked them dead ends because I can tell

2551
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:40,859
yeah you have to abandon the seed stock

2552
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,719
of the Autos or just extract it all and

2553
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:44,039
not market for breeding once you

2554
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:45,719
understand the traits that it's

2555
01:44:44,039 --> 01:44:47,519
expressing or not gonna help the future

2556
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:49,980
like what I said the future of

2557
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:51,960
autoflowers is full melt Auto flowers

2558
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:53,638
from all the best breeders so that no

2559
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,960
one can copy it so everyone can get a

2560
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:55,920
little bit of a little bit of hash every

2561
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,899
year

2562
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,940
we can make that culture from Amsterdam

2563
01:44:57,899 --> 01:45:02,579
like for New York City have that [ __ ]

2564
01:44:59,939 --> 01:45:04,799
you know grow outside of my little

2565
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:07,859
apartment on the windowsill

2566
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,239
yeah nice nice and and do you plan to

2567
01:45:07,859 --> 01:45:11,039
ever do

2568
01:45:09,238 --> 01:45:12,059
um some more photo period breeding or do

2569
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:14,639
you think you're just gonna stick to

2570
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:16,440
orders for the moment

2571
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:19,079
um yeah we're always doing Auto flowers

2572
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:21,960
and regulars um just because of the way

2573
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:24,779
the market uh is right now you know like

2574
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:26,760
there were not to the point where we

2575
01:45:24,779 --> 01:45:28,559
want the full metal Autoflower so we

2576
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:30,900
have to keep working with all the nice

2577
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,119
full Mount regular genetics and keep

2578
01:45:30,899 --> 01:45:36,059
figuring out what the trending terpene

2579
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:40,019
profiles are uh this year I work with

2580
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:41,719
the Chile Verde male and the 24 karat

2581
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:44,280
gold mail

2582
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:46,859
resin ranches picked them out and they

2583
01:45:44,279 --> 01:45:50,039
passed a lot of my tests so we're gonna

2584
01:45:46,859 --> 01:45:52,198
see a lot of cool Chili Pepper crosses

2585
01:45:50,039 --> 01:45:55,560
like shishito I hit the cake bomb

2586
01:45:52,198 --> 01:45:58,079
Skittles with the chili verde

2587
01:45:55,560 --> 01:46:01,320
um I'm most excited about are lemon cane

2588
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:03,779
number 66 from mashuk he hunted the

2589
01:46:01,319 --> 01:46:05,519
lemon cane to work for the rosin process

2590
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:06,960
really well kind of like how I wanted my

2591
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:10,199
lemon fat man

2592
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:13,158
and I hit the Chile Verde onto that and

2593
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:15,719
so right now there is a flavor Trend

2594
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:18,960
within Latin culture and within

2595
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:21,239
California of this flavor called tahin

2596
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,279
I don't know if you know about tahin oh

2597
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:25,919
yeah but yeah we'll be released we'll be

2598
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:29,158
releasing lemon tahin at ego Clash on

2599
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:31,980
the 9th oh yeah oh bro so we'll have

2600
01:46:29,158 --> 01:46:34,259
Tajin flavored rosin oh dude you're

2601
01:46:31,979 --> 01:46:35,879
gonna have to cross that to um something

2602
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:39,060
watermelon flavor you know the old

2603
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:41,639
staple tahin and watermelon okay so we

2604
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:43,199
have the chamoy do you know about chamoy

2605
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:46,079
so that's the other spice that you

2606
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:49,618
actually put on watermelon so I got the

2607
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:52,800
watermelon ice from Cano research which

2608
01:46:49,618 --> 01:46:55,079
is garlic cocktail and pineapple Fizz

2609
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,600
crossed together and it's got the

2610
01:46:55,079 --> 01:47:00,179
freaking watermelon Terps and I hit that

2611
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,980
with chili verde so we're doing tahin

2612
01:47:00,179 --> 01:47:04,739
and chamoy

2613
01:47:01,979 --> 01:47:07,138
uh beautiful man you got me excited that

2614
01:47:04,738 --> 01:47:09,479
sounds delicious cool cool cool well

2615
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:11,279
take me back the question we normally

2616
01:47:09,479 --> 01:47:13,859
ask people at the start of the episodes

2617
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:15,300
what was your first experience with

2618
01:47:13,859 --> 01:47:18,420
cannabis

2619
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:21,840
so my first experience getting high was

2620
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:26,880
that the Shoreline Amphitheater at like

2621
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:28,980
a big concert where my friend who

2622
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:32,520
um grew his own cannabis and everything

2623
01:47:28,979 --> 01:47:34,859
you know at 16 was like here you go uh

2624
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:37,260
here's this clay pipe I fired in my oven

2625
01:47:34,859 --> 01:47:39,179
and made myself and here's just weed I

2626
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,960
grew myself I was like holy [ __ ] all

2627
01:47:39,179 --> 01:47:43,020
right

2628
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:46,560
I I prepared myself and stuck little

2629
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:49,380
incense sticks in a circle around me and

2630
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,900
I got high and I realized that everyone

2631
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:53,819
else at the concert was [ __ ] high and

2632
01:47:51,899 --> 01:47:57,000
I was like oh [ __ ] everyone's doing this

2633
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:59,579
I was like oh damn like no matter how

2634
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:02,100
old people are everyone's high like I

2635
01:47:59,579 --> 01:48:05,158
was a great 16 year old moment of like

2636
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:07,320
realizing that like cannabis unites the

2637
01:48:05,158 --> 01:48:10,679
world and all people and all cultures

2638
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:13,799
and all ethnicities and all age groups

2639
01:48:10,679 --> 01:48:16,560
it's honestly why I keep doing the sesh

2640
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:19,980
in Oakland I love the sesh the pop-up

2641
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:22,800
seshes because every race every sexual

2642
01:48:19,979 --> 01:48:25,379
orientation and every age group can come

2643
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,480
and ask me about all my cannabis

2644
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:30,179
products and the farm and everything and

2645
01:48:27,479 --> 01:48:32,099
everyone can learn and come together it

2646
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:34,319
gets me the highest of anything is the

2647
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:37,199
biodiversity of humanity and the

2648
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:39,840
biodiversity in the guard a hundred

2649
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:42,359
percent man I've only been to one of the

2650
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,579
sessions in Oakland before but like the

2651
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:46,319
vibe was popping man it was like so fun

2652
01:48:44,579 --> 01:48:48,779
just to be there and it was exactly how

2653
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:51,179
you described hey it was really diverse

2654
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:53,099
it was great absolutely that's what

2655
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:54,779
cannabis is about and that's the model

2656
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:57,600
that will be sustainable in the future

2657
01:48:54,779 --> 01:49:00,960
yes just a small little market pop up

2658
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:04,800
yeah killer killer Okay so

2659
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:08,158
talk to me about how you went from that

2660
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:10,199
Shoreline experience to thinking

2661
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:11,158
I gotta plant my own seeds I have to do

2662
01:49:10,198 --> 01:49:13,559
this

2663
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:16,198
I was lucky enough

2664
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:18,659
to go to college and grow up in Santa

2665
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:19,859
Cruz and I understood the lifestyle

2666
01:49:18,658 --> 01:49:22,738
somewhat

2667
01:49:19,859 --> 01:49:24,839
um really started to unpeel the meaning

2668
01:49:22,738 --> 01:49:28,919
of Santa Cruz when I went to UC Santa

2669
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:32,639
Cruz and sold cannabis out of my little

2670
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:35,819
you know apartment dorm room there

2671
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:37,980
and I learned a lot and really brought

2672
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:40,559
people together and

2673
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:42,959
I was so inspired by all the Growers we

2674
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:45,360
don't have a frat scene at UC Santa Cruz

2675
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:47,639
you just go to burning man right so it's

2676
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:50,579
like all these people who had come

2677
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:52,800
before me had grown and you know

2678
01:49:50,579 --> 01:49:54,779
successfully and sold their weed and

2679
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,639
made successful companies and they were

2680
01:49:54,779 --> 01:49:58,259
throwing big parties at Burning Man and

2681
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:02,039
they told me how much this plant had

2682
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:03,840
given to them how much it provided and

2683
01:50:02,039 --> 01:50:05,519
how much they had taught you know just

2684
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,500
they had learned in general about

2685
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,020
themselves in the world and been able to

2686
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:12,658
be a man with a plan and help the world

2687
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:15,540
and it was very inspiring to see a lot

2688
01:50:12,658 --> 01:50:18,359
of these psychedelic Warriors out in the

2689
01:50:15,539 --> 01:50:21,719
world and representing their Santa Cruz

2690
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:24,839
Vibe and teaching people about cannabis

2691
01:50:21,719 --> 01:50:28,439
and learning the science simultaneously

2692
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:30,900
and yeah I mean if just in the scene of

2693
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:33,000
just smoking weed and living out you

2694
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:35,219
know renting houses while finishing your

2695
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,719
degree you learn how to grow weed if you

2696
01:50:35,219 --> 01:50:39,118
want to or not

2697
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,198
like you got roommates they're growing

2698
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:42,899
weeds you're going to learn about it

2699
01:50:40,198 --> 01:50:45,839
like right so all of a sudden it's like

2700
01:50:42,899 --> 01:50:47,698
wait like this thing really grows and it

2701
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,219
just brings people together and it's so

2702
01:50:47,698 --> 01:50:52,559
diverse and there's so many flavors and

2703
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:55,079
there's so many highs and it's kind of

2704
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:57,600
like at the birth moment like from 2001

2705
01:50:55,079 --> 01:51:01,139
to 2006 where everyone started to really

2706
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:03,179
get into cannabis I watched our 420

2707
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:06,118
little party

2708
01:51:03,179 --> 01:51:06,960
uh you see Santa Cruz Santa Cruz go from

2709
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:10,679
like

2710
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:13,020
you know 420 people in like 2002

2711
01:51:10,679 --> 01:51:16,260
to 14

2712
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:19,020
000 people by the time I graduated

2713
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:19,980
I mean we're talking exponential growth

2714
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:22,380
here

2715
01:51:19,979 --> 01:51:24,359
this stuff was growing so fast everyone

2716
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:26,039
was learning so fast everyone was making

2717
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:27,299
so much money and throwing such cool

2718
01:51:26,039 --> 01:51:29,639
parties and

2719
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:32,659
it was just an amazing scene to grow up

2720
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:35,760
in and I was so inspired and

2721
01:51:32,658 --> 01:51:37,259
I you know made food for the parties as

2722
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,179
like a business there's like a side

2723
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:41,639
hustle you know and would sell my

2724
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:44,340
chocolates and these little things and

2725
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:46,679
I I basically you know I went homeless

2726
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:48,119
during college and lived on people's

2727
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:49,980
decks and

2728
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:51,839
live in the forest sometimes had my

2729
01:51:49,979 --> 01:51:53,819
stuff in lockers on campus bike around

2730
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:56,699
sell weed at the skate park you know I

2731
01:51:53,819 --> 01:51:58,559
really really believed in cannabis and

2732
01:51:56,698 --> 01:52:01,738
it believed in me and I knew I had to

2733
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:03,480
sacrifice everything all my Comforts all

2734
01:52:01,738 --> 01:52:05,939
the things that I knew were important

2735
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:07,559
like I had to sacrifice them so I could

2736
01:52:05,939 --> 01:52:09,899
learn about this new thing that no one

2737
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:11,280
knew about so I could be ahead when the

2738
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:13,859
time came

2739
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:16,859
and that turned out to be really tough

2740
01:52:13,859 --> 01:52:20,460
and I needed a lot of help and

2741
01:52:16,859 --> 01:52:22,198
luckily one day I had a big Rave where I

2742
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:25,319
had made all the fanciest chocolate

2743
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:26,759
treats and Sushi and all this [ __ ] this

2744
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:28,500
guy came up to me he's like bro I got

2745
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:30,179

2749
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:40,020
and I was like okay sure and so I like

2750
01:52:37,738 --> 01:52:41,399
built a yurt on this guy's land after we

2751
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:43,860
got along

2752
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:45,000
he ended up being the direct descendant

2753
01:52:43,859 --> 01:52:47,639
of

2754
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,060
uh Steiner like his name's Matthew

2755
01:52:47,639 --> 01:52:53,880
Steiner like as of you know Rudolf

2756
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:56,039
Steiner who made biodynamics invented it

2757
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:57,300
and the guy who founded Waldorf School

2758
01:52:56,039 --> 01:52:59,819
and everything

2759
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:01,980
so I got to learn biodynamics from a

2760
01:52:59,819 --> 01:53:03,658
direct descendant of it so who was

2761
01:53:01,979 --> 01:53:06,178
applying it to cannabis for the first

2762
01:53:03,658 --> 01:53:08,599
time because he was the black sheep of

2763
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:08,600
the family

2764
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:14,639
no it was like oh [ __ ] this is like the

2765
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:16,679
opportunity of a lifetime this guy's

2766
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:19,739
like breeding seeds and has a degree in

2767
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:21,960
biology and like teaches me to collect

2768
01:53:19,738 --> 01:53:25,799
the mycelial leaf litter to make

2769
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:28,020
mushroom tea for the plants like wow I'm

2770
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,000
gonna do this and I [ __ ] did that

2771
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:32,100
[ __ ] I worked hard I watched him do

2772
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,679
really good and fail in different ways I

2773
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:39,060
helped at other farms and I got super

2774
01:53:34,679 --> 01:53:41,039
inspired and I saw so much waste and I

2775
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:42,719
knew that moment when I could plant my

2776
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:44,399
seed I would be ready and I wouldn't

2777
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:48,359
waste anything

2778
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:51,118
and I was and I did and now I'm here now

2779
01:53:48,359 --> 01:53:53,759
I got the farm now we got the flavors

2780
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:55,500
and we got employees and we got people

2781
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,020
who believe in us and finally got my

2782
01:53:55,500 --> 01:54:01,020
t-shirt and you know new seeds coming

2783
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:03,179
out all the time yeah finally

2784
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:06,179
that's awesome man it's a dream come

2785
01:54:03,179 --> 01:54:08,460
true dude really honestly yeah like hard

2786
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:10,679
work pays off and sacrifice yeah dude

2787
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:12,719
that's beautiful to hear man that's

2788
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:15,359
that's awesome to hear you live such a

2789
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:17,100
an interesting and varied life

2790
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:18,839
something we referenced earlier that I

2791
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:21,780
want to ask you about you know what's

2792
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:23,579
your plans to to get your work more

2793
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:26,039
widely available do you think you want

2794
01:54:23,579 --> 01:54:27,479
to get yourself out there at say more

2795
01:54:26,039 --> 01:54:29,460
Distributors get more of your product

2796
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:32,158
out there or do you still want to keep

2797
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:33,300
it a small scale operation in a certain

2798
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:35,519
sense

2799
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:37,560
so we'll still be a small scale

2800
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:39,719
operation but we want to expand our

2801
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:42,600
reach as far as you know feminized seeds

2802
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:45,420
will be doing feminized seeds as well as

2803
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:47,820
feminized autoflowers in the future all

2804
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:49,739
for resin production for the white and

2805
01:54:47,819 --> 01:54:52,618
black market so that people can produce

2806
01:54:49,738 --> 01:54:54,178
resin on their own independently or for

2807
01:54:52,618 --> 01:54:56,759
big companies that want to like run with

2808
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:59,039
our flavors so that more people can be

2809
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:01,199
aware of the cool flavors that I'm you

2810
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:02,819
know trying to make for people trying to

2811
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:05,399
make new experiences for people on the

2812
01:55:02,819 --> 01:55:07,079
Cannabis Market to blow their minds and

2813
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:08,158
you just got to keep up and do that work

2814
01:55:07,079 --> 01:55:09,899
and so

2815
01:55:08,158 --> 01:55:11,399
you know we're willing to make those

2816
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:14,039
thousands of seeds we're never going to

2817
01:55:11,399 --> 01:55:15,719
make like you know multi-millions right

2818
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:17,819
we're never going to make multi-millions

2819
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:20,279
of seeds so we're always going to have

2820
01:55:17,819 --> 01:55:21,899
that quality seed and get that out there

2821
01:55:20,279 --> 01:55:24,000
and yeah that's the goal for the future

2822
01:55:21,899 --> 01:55:27,539
is to win some awards with my genetics

2823
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:30,359
that's my that's my next goal oh amazing

2824
01:55:27,539 --> 01:55:32,819
and which which uh award would be the

2825
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:34,679
one you'd be most Keen to achieve in

2826
01:55:32,819 --> 01:55:37,738
your career

2827
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:39,480
oh just you know something for the rosin

2828
01:55:37,738 --> 01:55:41,759
just something that blows everyone's

2829
01:55:39,479 --> 01:55:44,339
mind you know so that people you know

2830
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:46,020
like if I could ideally this is what I

2831
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:48,840
really want I want to make an Autoflower

2832
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:50,880
rosin flavor that wins and people don't

2833
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:53,100
know it's Autoflower so then people are

2834
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,900
like oh [ __ ] I've always talked [ __ ]

2835
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:56,460
about autoflowers because I thought they

2836
01:55:54,899 --> 01:55:58,319
were the same as cannabis and I screwed

2837
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:00,060
it up when I grew it but maybe I should

2838
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:03,539
look into that again

2839
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:06,239
ha that's brilliant and I mean as a sort

2840
01:56:03,539 --> 01:56:08,100
of just a rough guess how far off in

2841
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:10,500
time do you think we are from when that

2842
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,360
sort of thing might be possible oh only

2843
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:14,880
12 months oh yeah I've been working on

2844
01:56:12,359 --> 01:56:17,039
this last five years oh yeah uh just

2845
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,659
another year push I think by by this

2846
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:20,939
time next year we'll have the full melt

2847
01:56:18,658 --> 01:56:24,960
genetics that'll be making rosin

2848
01:56:20,939 --> 01:56:27,059
in 80 Days From The Sea germination day

2849
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,340
wow that'll be special

2850
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:31,739
I would love to ask is there anywhere

2851
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:34,980
people can go to get your seeds now

2852
01:56:31,738 --> 01:56:37,379
uh so right now uh the website still

2853
01:56:34,979 --> 01:56:39,299
hasn't gotten built but we're gonna do

2854
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:42,239
that that's basically the plan for the

2855
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:45,840
next three months but so far we just um

2856
01:56:42,238 --> 01:56:48,059
you know just go on Instagram and let me

2857
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:50,760
know where you're at and figure out if

2858
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:52,980
our local laws can make it work yeah

2859
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:55,679
fantastic fantastic get in touch with

2860
01:56:52,979 --> 01:56:56,579
him and a question I love to ask all our

2861
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:58,618
guests

2862
01:56:56,579 --> 01:57:00,238
from your perspective doesn't have to be

2863
01:56:58,618 --> 01:57:01,920
from the general Public's perspective it

2864
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:02,698
can be because of some special reason to

2865
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,699
you

2866
01:57:02,698 --> 01:57:07,319
for you what's the rarest seeds in your

2867
01:57:05,698 --> 01:57:10,439
vault

2868
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:12,420
well I have you know just a few seeds of

2869
01:57:10,439 --> 01:57:14,219
land race like pure land race that I

2870
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:18,239
haven't popped yet so I have those pure

2871
01:57:14,219 --> 01:57:22,020
Tanzanian I have some pure Argentinian I

2872
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:24,598
have some pure uh Crimean from the

2873
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:26,699
Crimean peninsula

2874
01:57:24,599 --> 01:57:30,060
um I actually grew those out this year

2875
01:57:26,698 --> 01:57:32,698
and I'm very excited about that because

2876
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:35,340
I found trading cannabis that I've never

2877
01:57:32,698 --> 01:57:38,219
really found before I did one post about

2878
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:39,960
it basically it flowered it got seeded

2879
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:42,960
and then it flowered again so once it

2880
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:45,599
got the signal that it was seated it it

2881
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:48,719
grew four more branches from its root

2882
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:50,579
Zone and started flowering again and

2883
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:53,779
then that got seeded and then it

2884
01:57:50,579 --> 01:57:56,460
flowered again so it flowered five times

2885
01:57:53,779 --> 01:57:58,679
and so I hit that I crossed that with

2886
01:57:56,460 --> 01:58:00,359
the Satsuma sure so I'm thinking about

2887
01:57:58,679 --> 01:58:03,480
like the future of cannabis where it's

2888
01:58:00,359 --> 01:58:06,420
like a Autoflower timing so in 80 Days

2889
01:58:03,479 --> 01:58:08,698
you get like a QP and then 100 days

2890
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:10,739
later you get a half pound and then

2891
01:58:08,698 --> 01:58:12,118
October you get even more and you cut it

2892
01:58:10,738 --> 01:58:14,459
back three times

2893
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:16,079
uh it was amazing yeah so that's what

2894
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:17,460
I'm most excited about for genetic

2895
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:18,359
traits is something I've never seen

2896
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:20,460
before

2897
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:22,319
that's really exciting I've never heard

2898
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:24,118
anything about that at all cool cool

2899
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:25,799
cool so

2900
01:58:24,118 --> 01:58:28,139
so this next one is a general question

2901
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:32,039
but I'm wondering what is your hope

2902
01:58:28,139 --> 01:58:34,859
overall for the trajectory of the scene

2903
01:58:32,039 --> 01:58:37,460
I hope that the Legacy operators and

2904
01:58:34,859 --> 01:58:40,799
like those who care and have won awards

2905
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:42,800
pre-2016 who have families will continue

2906
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,960
to thrive

2907
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:49,079
and I sincerely hope that the

2908
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:52,439
billionaires and Canadian investors

2909
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:55,139
continue to go bankrupt

2910
01:58:52,439 --> 01:58:57,658
because it's not helping anything I

2911
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:59,579
couldn't believe the facility they built

2912
01:58:57,658 --> 01:59:01,799
in Death Valley over here in California

2913
01:58:59,579 --> 01:59:04,738
it's like over a hundred million dollar

2914
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:07,139
Glass House the hot water that comes out

2915
01:59:04,738 --> 01:59:08,638
of the earth naturally there is like 110

2916
01:59:07,139 --> 01:59:10,819
degrees so they have all these chillers

2917
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:13,618
just to get the water cool

2918
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:16,380
and I just couldn't help but think like

2919
01:59:13,618 --> 01:59:19,559
they could have just put cow poop on the

2920
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:21,659
earth and put a barbed wire of fence

2921
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:24,060
and then just gotten those Afghani

2922
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:26,638
genetics that can just withstand hot

2923
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:28,080
weather all year or Moroccan and then

2924
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:29,760
just done a land race in the Death

2925
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:32,099
Valley instead of building a hundred

2926
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:33,840
million dollar facility so I feel like

2927
01:59:32,099 --> 01:59:35,460
anyone who's like kind of like trying to

2928
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:38,219
like build their way to their empire

2929
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:42,899
needs to just stop and like do something

2930
01:59:38,219 --> 01:59:44,520
else and like realize that like you know

2931
01:59:42,899 --> 01:59:46,439
there's people who care and there's

2932
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:49,260
people who have done the business for a

2933
01:59:46,439 --> 01:59:50,638
long time and yeah you can buy their IP

2934
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:52,500
some guys will sell you their

2935
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:54,480
intellectual property or whatever but

2936
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:56,880
anyone who would do that doesn't really

2937
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,799
know or doesn't really care about being

2938
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:00,900
in it long term

2939
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:02,520
so it's like a it's a tricky point right

2940
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:04,319
now there's a lot of guys who are doing

2941
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:05,460
that right now my age who are like oh

2942
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:06,960
I've been in the business I'm just gonna

2943
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:08,639
sell all my information to a rich guy

2944
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,779
and then I don't have to worry I can

2945
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:11,819
raise my family

2946
02:00:09,779 --> 02:00:14,219
I'm not saying I judge you I'm just

2947
02:00:11,819 --> 02:00:16,079
saying like man sucks you know it's like

2948
02:00:14,219 --> 02:00:17,639
the paradigm shift

2949
02:00:16,079 --> 02:00:19,859
so

2950
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:21,719
yeah definitely a tough situation it's

2951
02:00:19,859 --> 02:00:24,420
hard to blame people

2952
02:00:21,719 --> 02:00:27,300
I'd love to follow up you mentioned it a

2953
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:29,460
few times the greasy versus tacky

2954
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:31,139
feeling of trichomes I know that you

2955
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:32,760
often hear people talking about greasy

2956
02:00:31,139 --> 02:00:34,079
being good for concentrates but I

2957
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:36,239
believe you broke it down into like a

2958
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:39,118
further sort of subdivision how would

2959
02:00:36,238 --> 02:00:41,459
you describe to people like the way

2960
02:00:39,118 --> 02:00:42,839
trichomes should feel for each style of

2961
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:45,719
production

2962
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:48,179
so the ones that leave a slippery grease

2963
02:00:45,719 --> 02:00:50,340
on your fingers are the ones that are

2964
02:00:48,179 --> 02:00:51,618
going to make good diamonds and those

2965
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:53,940
are going to be

2966
02:00:51,618 --> 02:00:56,579
antagonistic to the water process and

2967
02:00:53,939 --> 02:00:58,259
it's like the alpha pinene terp so we

2968
02:00:56,579 --> 02:01:00,899
thought this one would wash last year

2969
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:03,900
you know we had six thousand grams of it

2970
02:01:00,899 --> 02:01:05,579
it looked awesome perfect rainbow smell

2971
02:01:03,899 --> 02:01:09,839
but it was a little Piney and I was

2972
02:01:05,579 --> 02:01:11,519
worried we got like a .05 you know 0.5

2973
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:14,099
wash you know

2974
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:17,460
I think half a percent right but not

2975
02:01:14,099 --> 02:01:20,340
only that like the texture of it gummed

2976
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:22,380
up all the filters in the water rosin

2977
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:24,420
process so then they had to do an

2978
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:25,560
alcohol wash just to clean just to do

2979
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:27,359
another run

2980
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:29,340
so not only does it like screw

2981
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:31,319
everything up it makes it a lot harder

2982
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:34,980
to like make water hash again if you use

2983
02:01:31,319 --> 02:01:38,039
the wrong uh you know starting material

2984
02:01:34,979 --> 02:01:40,259
so basically uh the greasy material is

2985
02:01:38,039 --> 02:01:41,880
not going to work and your super tacky

2986
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:45,300
material that like stretches like a

2987
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:47,400
spider web or Sandy to the touch that

2988
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:49,500
can work a lot better

2989
02:01:47,399 --> 02:01:52,439
and then obviously the whole jar Tech

2990
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:55,198
everyone talking about where you put 20

2991
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:58,019
grams of fresh frozen in a mason jar and

2992
02:01:55,198 --> 02:02:01,259
then shake it with ice cold water and

2993
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:03,420
then see what knocks off and the idea is

2994
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:05,760
that if you got 20 grams and you've got

2995
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:08,399
a five percenter then you'll see one

2996
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,780
gram of trichomes fall off into the

2997
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:12,658
corner and you should be able to see

2998
02:02:09,779 --> 02:02:14,698
what a pile of one gram looks like

2999
02:02:12,658 --> 02:02:17,339
and if you don't have that then you're

3000
02:02:14,698 --> 02:02:18,899
looking at not a rosin winner yeah

3001
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:20,639
that's a great breakdown

3002
02:02:18,899 --> 02:02:23,279
that's why the resin dial was invented

3003
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:24,719
too ah okay interesting interesting

3004
02:02:23,279 --> 02:02:28,079
interesting

3005
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:31,500
so on to the final five questions we ask

3006
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:33,479
all our guests great what was the single

3007
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:35,158
most memorable cannabis experience

3008
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:36,718
you've ever had it doesn't have to be

3009
02:02:35,158 --> 02:02:39,000
like the strongest hit but just most

3010
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:42,480
memorable for whatever reason

3011
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:45,960
oh oh by far being the judge uh Taylor t

3012
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:48,658
bezel chose me as a secondary judge for

3013
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:51,239
uh the emerald cup before Skittles was

3014
02:02:48,658 --> 02:02:54,779
known as a strain and so before rosin

3015
02:02:51,238 --> 02:02:58,198
was in the emerald cup I got to dab full

3016
02:02:54,779 --> 02:03:01,439
melt and put it in order I came to the

3017
02:02:58,198 --> 02:03:03,598
Airbnb in at midnight and I stayed for

3018
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:05,939
five hours or until 4 20 in the morning

3019
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:08,880
I was so high never been that high in my

3020
02:03:05,939 --> 02:03:10,439
life and you know Cuban grower and all

3021
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:12,719
the guys in the Russian industry were

3022
02:03:10,439 --> 02:03:14,039
like oh we've got these hashes we've got

3023
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,779
to put them in order we've got to figure

3024
02:03:14,039 --> 02:03:17,158
out a winner they just have numbers on

3025
02:03:15,779 --> 02:03:18,960
them you've got to write notes you've

3026
02:03:17,158 --> 02:03:20,819
got to be a judge you've gotta and I

3027
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,539
[ __ ] took dabs of everything and took

3028
02:03:20,819 --> 02:03:26,939
notes and you know five star six star

3029
02:03:23,539 --> 02:03:29,158
what kind of flavors multiple flavors is

3030
02:03:26,939 --> 02:03:31,919
there flavor on the inhale in the mouth

3031
02:03:29,158 --> 02:03:33,539
and is there an aftertaste is it

3032
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:36,300
genetically similar to something I've

3033
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:38,340
had or not so I did all those things on

3034
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:40,860
20 rosins and then put them in an order

3035
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:44,219
and then gonna dab them again and make

3036
02:03:40,859 --> 02:03:47,939
sure that the top five were the top five

3037
02:03:44,219 --> 02:03:50,158
and I voted for this number one that I

3038
02:03:47,939 --> 02:03:51,419
remember the notes still multiple fruit

3039
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:53,698
flavors

3040
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:56,340
and every time I hit it even the second

3041
02:03:53,698 --> 02:03:57,839
time I found other fruit flavors and

3042
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:59,279
that ended up being the Skittles which

3043
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:00,719
is what made Brandon famous and

3044
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:02,939
everything so

3045
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:05,099
that was definitely the best high

3046
02:04:02,939 --> 02:04:07,138
experience was like trying to figure out

3047
02:04:05,099 --> 02:04:08,279
the [ __ ] with no names and just numbers

3048
02:04:07,139 --> 02:04:11,179
on them

3049
02:04:08,279 --> 02:04:12,960
that sounds beautiful and just for

3050
02:04:11,179 --> 02:04:15,060
clarification's sake what do you think

3051
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:17,158
of the genetics in Skittles oh yeah

3052
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:20,340
everyone's [ __ ] like oh it's a pink

3053
02:04:17,158 --> 02:04:23,759
grapefruit and oh it's a green Sherbert

3054
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:25,260
and oh it's like I mean I just like yo

3055
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,480
let's see the terp test if you know how

3056
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:29,219
to grow it and it's high in osamine then

3057
02:04:27,479 --> 02:04:32,279
it's going to have the dominant terpene

3058
02:04:29,219 --> 02:04:34,880
that almost all rosin doesn't have most

3059
02:04:32,279 --> 02:04:37,439
rosin has limonene mercene or

3060
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,420
beta-cariothalene so if you try that

3061
02:04:37,439 --> 02:04:41,698
osamine flavor if you grow it correctly

3062
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:44,279
and it has high osamine and it's the

3063
02:04:41,698 --> 02:04:47,419
dominant one that's the Skittles [ __ ]

3064
02:04:44,279 --> 02:04:50,698
amazing awesome flavor yeah

3065
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:53,158
beautiful stuff on the other end of the

3066
02:04:50,698 --> 02:04:55,319
spectrum what is something where

3067
02:04:53,158 --> 02:04:57,719
everyone was hyping it up you were super

3068
02:04:55,319 --> 02:04:59,698
Keen to try it and then when you did you

3069
02:04:57,719 --> 02:05:04,560
were left a bit disappointed

3070
02:04:59,698 --> 02:05:08,158
uh let's see uh purple punch

3071
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:10,440
um Gorilla Glue uh

3072
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:13,138
but I've never really liked Bubba

3073
02:05:10,439 --> 02:05:14,598
everyone swears by their old school 98

3074
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:17,279
Bubba

3075
02:05:14,599 --> 02:05:19,380
I'd rather have Malibu pure Crush any

3076
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:21,179
day over that Bubba smells like it's

3077
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:24,000
just like you know astringent limes

3078
02:05:21,179 --> 02:05:27,060
versus like a floral Rush

3079
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,698
uh I mean so many people try to Market

3080
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:32,219
all these

3081
02:05:28,698 --> 02:05:34,079
crosses like the gelato 33 it's all

3082
02:05:32,219 --> 02:05:37,198
right you know I've the original

3083
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:40,979
Sherbert is good

3084
02:05:37,198 --> 02:05:43,738
um cherry pie is pretty over hyped

3085
02:05:40,979 --> 02:05:46,198
a lot of sour diesels you know because

3086
02:05:43,738 --> 02:05:47,939
the original cut so lost

3087
02:05:46,198 --> 02:05:49,979
so it's like everyone's like oh this

3088
02:05:47,939 --> 02:05:52,859
prefix on Sour Diesel I'm like there

3089
02:05:49,979 --> 02:05:54,238
ain't no sour gas and rancidity in here

3090
02:05:52,859 --> 02:05:56,039
you know

3091
02:05:54,238 --> 02:05:57,899
a lot of things I mean that's why we're

3092
02:05:56,039 --> 02:06:00,000
it's like why there's opportunity right

3093
02:05:57,899 --> 02:06:02,759
for geneticists because there's like

3094
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,738
kind of a lot of like mishmash flavors

3095
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:06,539
that have been re hybridized too many

3096
02:06:04,738 --> 02:06:08,359
times I know it tastes like anything in

3097
02:06:06,539 --> 02:06:12,000
particular

3098
02:06:08,359 --> 02:06:14,158
yeah definitely definitely okay so next

3099
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,198
question if I'm going to drop you off on

3100
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:18,299
a desert island and you can take three

3101
02:06:16,198 --> 02:06:20,339
strains with you for the rest of time

3102
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:23,719
what three things are you gonna take you

3103
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:23,719
can take clones or seeds

3104
02:06:24,118 --> 02:06:28,819
all right uh let's see

3105
02:06:28,979 --> 02:06:35,759
Durbin poison for sure

3106
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:37,560
uh honey bananas

3107
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:39,360
to offset that it's like completely

3108
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:42,659
different it's like the opposite like

3109
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:45,539
Durban poisons [ __ ] not sweet it

3110
02:06:42,658 --> 02:06:47,638
ain't fruity and it ain't sit us you

3111
02:06:45,539 --> 02:06:49,979
know sedating at all and that honey

3112
02:06:47,639 --> 02:06:51,500
bananas does all those things it's sweet

3113
02:06:49,979 --> 02:06:54,079
sedating

3114
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:56,880
fruity as [ __ ]

3115
02:06:54,079 --> 02:06:59,579
uh let's see what's the one that I

3116
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:02,520
freaking love recently I grew a Wilson

3117
02:06:59,579 --> 02:07:05,819
cross that was like a mind flare

3118
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:07,980
I didn't know the background

3119
02:07:05,819 --> 02:07:10,439
um but it tasted like pink marshmallows

3120
02:07:07,979 --> 02:07:12,419
but man I guess the chop cookies because

3121
02:07:10,439 --> 02:07:15,419
the the chop cookies hit me harder than

3122
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:17,579
anything yeah yeah cause that I didn't

3123
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:19,679
really realize how good chop cookies was

3124
02:07:17,579 --> 02:07:23,460
until you know someone with like living

3125
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:25,560
soil indoor LED who like wins Awards

3126
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:28,139
like touches that cut and like actually

3127
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:30,719
cares you know luckily heads that roll

3128
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:33,000
like relocated to our zone so I get to

3129
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:35,760
trade with them and try their stuff

3130
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,039
wow you can just taste the care in that

3131
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:39,780
orange flavor and so then that's not in

3132
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:42,118
Honey bananas or Durban yeah so that's

3133
02:07:39,779 --> 02:07:45,238
my three definitely

3134
02:07:42,118 --> 02:07:47,579
good lace good list uh in an alternative

3135
02:07:45,238 --> 02:07:50,039
situation we're gonna drop someone else

3136
02:07:47,579 --> 02:07:52,500
off at the island someone you're not a

3137
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:54,238
big fan of you get to pick which three

3138
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:55,920
strains we leave them with what are you

3139
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:58,259
gonna leave them with

3140
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:00,359
oh so they okay so they like need a

3141
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:01,860
lesson yeah it's up to you what you want

3142
02:08:00,359 --> 02:08:05,118
to do but I'm interested what three

3143
02:08:01,859 --> 02:08:08,639
things are you gonna leave them with

3144
02:08:05,118 --> 02:08:11,158
uh I would leave them with like the land

3145
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:14,760
race from Tanzania that probably has

3146
02:08:11,158 --> 02:08:16,859
like you know five percent THC Maybe

3147
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:19,320
you know so they can like earn some

3148
02:08:16,859 --> 02:08:21,299
respect for all like the work of the

3149
02:08:19,319 --> 02:08:22,679
continent of Africa and the thousands of

3150
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:25,199
years that people have done without

3151
02:08:22,679 --> 02:08:28,020
credit you know

3152
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:30,000
um and then like green crack just

3153
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:33,260
because it's like a horrible weed with a

3154
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,359
horrible High and a horrible name

3155
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:40,320
and uh

3156
02:08:35,359 --> 02:08:41,759
let's see let's like really Bland like

3157
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:45,359
that's like

3158
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:47,760
like the like blue dream cross it's like

3159
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:50,219
like not the real Santa Cruz Blue Dream

3160
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:53,340
but like the blue dream hay that's like

3161
02:08:50,219 --> 02:08:56,520
the like oh yeah like oh there's God

3162
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:58,500
damn that one it's horrible bro it's so

3163
02:08:56,520 --> 02:09:00,659
like hay and it produces the best

3164
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:03,300
looking Blue Dream buds better than the

3165
02:09:00,658 --> 02:09:05,219
original but it has no Terps and so it's

3166
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:09,119
like this horrible cut that got around

3167
02:09:05,219 --> 02:09:10,859
because someone was Insidious like and

3168
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:12,420
decided to do that they should stay

3169
02:09:10,859 --> 02:09:13,939
there with that too that's the person

3170
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:17,760
who should go there

3171
02:09:13,939 --> 02:09:19,738
there you go okay so final question if I

3172
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,139
could give you a time machine you can go

3173
02:09:19,738 --> 02:09:25,019
back to any period in history you can go

3174
02:09:22,139 --> 02:09:26,760
anywhere to collect some seeds or clones

3175
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:28,020
where are you gonna go what are you

3176
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:30,360
gonna collect

3177
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:33,900
I wouldn't have to go back far

3178
02:09:30,359 --> 02:09:36,658
yeah I would just go back to like

3179
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:38,939
92.

3180
02:09:36,658 --> 02:09:40,799
and just like have you could get all

3181
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:43,738
that seed stock from the 80s and then

3182
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:45,599
some of those new ogs and these things

3183
02:09:43,738 --> 02:09:47,638
like the real pure kush and all that

3184
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:49,679
exclusive stuff

3185
02:09:47,639 --> 02:09:52,319
yeah and then just start breeding with

3186
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:54,239
it the way I knew how yeah and then buy

3187
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:56,000
Bitcoin I'll be set where is this time

3188
