00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,638
for this episode but I want to ask you

114
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,439
because you mentioned it a bit earlier

115
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,120
to me how's the garden looking today

116
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,439
have you been in there

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,540
oh yeah the garden is uh every day so

118
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,339
yes I've been in the garden lately and

119
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,960
what are you working on at the moment

120
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,219
um right now I'm working on a bunch of

121
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,000
Mexicans

122
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,000
um ties some Hawaiians Colombians

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,639
I'm trying to bring back some of the

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,680
old Colombian red type stuff

125
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,139
um you know people were familiar with uh

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,939
like wackyweed it was actually like the

127
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,519
resonance versions of the Colombian red

128
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,199
or the punto Rojo so I've been looking

129
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,359
for the um

130
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,500
the phenotypes that are more specific to

131
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,939
that

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,800
um I'm trying to bring back some of the

133
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,418
favorites that people love with the

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
Colombian gold

135
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,339
um certain varieties of Colombian gold

136
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,079
that are kind of more sought after than

137
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,239
what people know as Colombian gold

138
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,159
because a lot of the Colombian gold

139
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,259
was actually either like a low lead

140
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,000
Colombian red that was bleached or

141
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,319
another Colombian that was like bleached

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,180
in the Sun so a lot of what people think

143
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,159
is climbing gold was something other

144
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,139
than what it was

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,939
oh and um I'm also working on some

146
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,439
different ties I'm analyzing the

147
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,418
different varieties trying to narrow

148
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,879
down

149
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:49,439
where the chocolates came from I have a

150
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,180
good understanding of where they are but

151
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,879
I'm I'm verifying what I already know

152
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,939
with what I'm finding

153
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,339
um trying to prove from

154
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,719
Me growing the the varieties of

155
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,418
chocolate Thai that were here in the

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,060
states that were sold to sticks and then

157
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:08,279
taking what was uh or land race or

158
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,918
heirloom varieties grown in Thailand and

159
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,899
Cambodian Laos and trying to figure out

160
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,180
what the genetic stock was that created

161
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,099
these what was their names

162
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,680
um that the Growers were using for these

163
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,539
strains and then as it transship to

164
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,959
different countries like Australia

165
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,818
United States uh Europe

166
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,099
um what was what was the strains

167
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,259
beforehand and what were they um when

168
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,180
they got to like the sellers that people

169
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,319
received so I'm trying to narrow that

170
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,139
down

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,600
um a bunch of Highland ties mango ties

172
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,199
purple ties

173
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,680
um Juicy Fruit ties lots of different

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,500
uh squirrel tail Thai stick Fridays just

175
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,180
trying to narrow down what the

176
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,879
provenance of these are where they came

177
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,680
from what provinces were more the

178
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,680
majority of these varieties came from

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,840
were they lowland Highland

180
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,819
um the microclimates associated with

181
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,918
them the people the history of those

182
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,780
people did they come from China did they

183
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,359
come from India

184
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,000
um that type of thing uh and then I'm

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,100
trying to bring back some Hawaiian lines

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,839
um that people love which are easier to

187
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,240
grow you know they have the resin and

188
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,339
the high types that people love and I

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,720
just something special that you know a

190
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,019
lot of people

191
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,880
really love are the wine types so

192
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,159
um and the Mexicans I'm trying to bring

193
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,019
back some of the heirloom stuff that

194
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,180
people are growing still in Mexico and

195
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:37,079
some of the older stock that I'm trying

196
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,418
to preserve so that more people can be

197
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,060
um familiar with these lines that I grew

198
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:44,758
up smoking which is some of my favorite

199
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,560
um of all the different types of herb

200
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,580
Mexican cannabis is a special thing to

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,879
me

202
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,859
wow I think one of the catchphrases I

203
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,259
say on this show is you've just given me

204
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,860
so many Avenues we need to go down that

205
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,300
was truly uh fantastic I guess the first

206
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,580
place to start is you know you mentioned

207
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,680
the Colombian red and gold how would you

208
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,240
give someone like myself who has never

209
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,519
been able to have either unfortunately

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,900
how would you compare and contrast the

211
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,478
two

212
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,638
well um the Columbian gold let's start

213
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,579
with that Colombian gold

214
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,879
is it ever a really unique High compared

215
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:24,418
to other varieties it's it's an own it's

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,860
its own uh variety uh the high is mostly

217
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:27,538
in the head

218
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,960
um it's clear

219
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:33,360
um euphoric it's psychedelic colorful

220
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,899
but does it affect the body so you get a

221
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,459
all in the head type of high the tastes

222
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,979
are

223
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,278
honeysuckle astringent kind of affects

224
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:48,778
the nose but it's light it's a light

225
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:52,039
Airy Aroma when the Smugglers went to uh

226
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:55,019
Santa Marta the Sierra Nevada uh the

227
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,819
peninsula where all the trans shipments

228
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,139
were happening

229
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,019
um the Bales that they were getting they

230
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:04,319
were getting you know 200 300 bales of

231
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,278
uh Colombian at a time the Columbia Gold

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
was maybe

233
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,299
you know one bale maybe two they had to

234
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,179
go to

235
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,979
um Farm to farm and they were only able

236
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,939
to collect enough for maybe one to two

237
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,100
bales

238
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,080
uh

239
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,959
you know at a time so it was very rare

240
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,060
that people actually had the true uh

241
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,979
Colombian gold

242
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:30,599
um there was varieties that were called

243
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:33,360
Lamona or La Mota La Mota means high on

244
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,500
a hill and Lamona means the blonde those

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,120
were like the uh arachio Indians the

246
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,059
Indians that were up in the High Sierra

247
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,879
Nevadas they had a variety of clemming

248
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:47,518
gold which was more of a

249
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,100
like a Highland Colombian and those were

250
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,820
more of the longer flowering varieties

251
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,320
that were gold red purple

252
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,000
um Turned orange and rainbow different

253
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,100
colors

254
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,639
um and that's a real special stuff now

255
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,899
there was also lowland Sierra Nevada

256
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,958
Colombian gold and those were the

257
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,360
smaller plants also very nice but not

258
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,679
quite as longer flowering as the

259
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,680
Highland varieties

260
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,480
so that was kind of the climbing gold so

261
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,759
climbing Golds the the

262
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,379
um majority of them will turn purple and

263
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,259
gold

264
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:27,179
um some rare phenotypes will be red and

265
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,919
then rainbow colored

266
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,219
for the

267
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,759
opposite side which is uh the Colombian

268
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,759
Punta Rojos the Colombian Reds

269
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:43,139
those were more of a narcotic High the

270
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:46,319
reason is that it has a CBD content in

271
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:50,399
it so it it actually has like a body

272
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,660
effect unlike the Columbian gold

273
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,740
um so there's uh CBG CBC

274
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,958
um I would

275
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,919
believe that's probably thcv as well

276
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,599
Delta eight and nine THC as well and

277
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,679
then a lot of different

278
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,019
um cannabinoids flavonoids and uh uh

279
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,139
anti-science the things that change the

280
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,700
colors of the plants as you'll find with

281
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,778
the Colombian Puerto Rojos they'll turn

282
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,519
red blue purple

283
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:23,278
and shades that are more darker kind of

284
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:27,179
like the Panama Red at one time Panama

285
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:30,419
Red Panama was part of Colombia so a lot

286
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:34,379
of the punto Rojos were actually

287
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:36,000
you know the same as Panama Red but the

288
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,759
varieties that were closer to the border

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,919
with Panama now

290
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,379
um were actually more the jungly types

291
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,360
they were hotter they dealt with more

292
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:46,799
resin they had to deal with the more

293
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,259
extremes of the heat because they were

294
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,179
more of a jungly type

295
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,159
so when people think of Panama Red it's

296
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:56,639
actually like a Colombian variety so

297
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,958
it's closer to Colombian puto Rojo

298
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,980
um

299
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:04,319
and so you get these um longer different

300
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,079
tie types that are more physical

301
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,820
um people actually uh when you had a

302
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,479
really good Colombian red thought that

303
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,600
the Columbian red high was more uh more

304
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,579
favorited than the Colombian Golds and

305
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,040
the Really resonance varieties of

306
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:22,199
Colombian puto Rojo were what what

307
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,778
people called wacky weed and those were

308
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,820
the very resinous dusty types that

309
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,679
people would sell the resellers would

310
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,040
cut wacky weed but it was Colombian

311
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,019
punto Rojo

312
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,719
wow what a comprehensive rundown I feel

313
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,000
like I've learned so much because what's

314
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,160
interesting is that the Colombian as a

315
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,620
as a broad umbrella has really come into

316
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,139
the Zeitgeist because I think that with

317
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,060
the Advent of the black Cuban Haze

318
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,820
becoming very popular in the past few

319
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:53,518
years we hear a lot about the Colombian

320
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,278
dominance you see in that cut and it got

321
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,259
me wondering do you think do you think

322
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,939
Colombian is one of the unsung heroes in

323
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,220
Haze because a lot of people including

324
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,320
myself used to attribute a lot of the

325
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,180
magic of haze to the tie but I'm now

326
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,800
starting to think more and more was the

327
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:10,019
Colombian really contributing a lot more

328
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,479
than I maybe gave it credit for

329
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,179
well there's there's more than one Haze

330
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,159
so you gotta you gotta narrow it down to

331
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,078
is it um

332
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,539
is it the haze that first came around

333
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,699
the first Haze was more Mexican punto

334
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,679
rojo with the Colombians that were

335
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,778
coming around so

336
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,899
um Mexican and Colombian were more of

337
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:33,778
the composition of what people knows

338
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,399
Haze there's Old Timers Haze which seems

339
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:38,039
to be all Colombian

340
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,980
which is not even not even Haze it's

341
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:44,819
just considered a haze but it's not what

342
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,100
people know as Haze so those two can be

343
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,079
considered confused because they look

344
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,399
the same but they are from Colombian

345
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,799
genetics

346
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,078
uh but what a lot of people believe is

347
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,299
the special stuff are the Colombians

348
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,219
that ran them the Purple Haze is from

349
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:02,159
the Colombian purple variety so it could

350
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,139
be from the corinto side or from the

351
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,899
Colombian Punta Rojo side that you get

352
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,060
these purple phenotypes also there's uh

353
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,240
the purple haze from the Colombian Punta

354
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,018
Rojo I mean Colombian um Santa Marta

355
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,919
gold

356
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,659
uh so the combination of these different

357
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,439
Colombians and the purple phenotypes got

358
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:25,259
what people know as Purple Haze

359
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,339
um later if you're looking at original

360
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,519
Haze

361
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,540
that was messed with with Sam when he

362
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,940
went to Holland they added the ties then

363
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:39,240
because what they had for Hayes was kind

364
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,399
of lacking so they added the different

365
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,240
hazes and the Kerala and the Vietnamese

366
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,240
in different lines

367
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:50,880
wow that's incredible so just to clarify

368
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,459
if someone said to you what do you think

369
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,799
the original genetics in Haze was what

370
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,659
would you answer with

371
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,639
huh well it's

372
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,559
me and Neville used to talk he was a

373
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,579
friend of mine I never got to meet him

374
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,759
in person but we used to talk via Skype

375
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:11,039
um so

376
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:14,220
I don't want to say anything that would

377
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,778
he was very Coy with his answers

378
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,660
um

379
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,360
he received the seeds in New York

380
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:23,578
um from some people that were doing the

381
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,039
shipments for

382
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:27,419
you know they weren't considered

383
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,860
they weren't they they weren't the

384
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,139
people growing the varieties so these

385
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,959
were like the resellers that got the

386
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,778
seeds but the seeds that were

387
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,599
uh turned into original Haze and Devil's

388
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:41,240
Haze seemed to be more like the Mulan

389
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,639
Benny Madness

390
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,198
wow bombshell

391
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,459
but you know

392
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,859
um

393
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,599
it's hard to tell what what you see from

394
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,820
some of the pictures and what some of

395
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,040
the seed banks had received some of that

396
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,199
stuff seems to be Thai dominant like the

397
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,759
original Haze for Flying Dutchman

398
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:00,719
some of the earlier stuff seems to be

399
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,179
Thai

400
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,699
um dominant so it's original Haze Thai

401
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:09,239
Dominic so

402
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:10,198
you know was it Sam Sam stuff that was

403
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,899
used

404
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,000
with the haze that they got and they

405
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,159
kind of went from there

406
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,059
um or was it you know original Haze that

407
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,519
was

408
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:23,458
previous to that

409
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,740
um it's hard to say but it seems the tie

410
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:28,559
stuff was more

411
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,019
original Haze later on but if you look

412
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,039
at some of the structures like now's

413
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,379
Hayes

414
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,879
um some of the phenotypes look like mole

415
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,860
Unity Madness which you know they're

416
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,419
tied derivative so that would make more

417
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,320
sense I was assume

418
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:45,778
if you look at some of the older

419
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,540
pictures of the haze and some of the

420
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:50,939
people that were breeding it had said

421
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,019
um Mexican Puerto Rojo was one of the

422
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,480
the

423
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,100
the portions that created Haze and then

424
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,820
the Colombians that came along with it

425
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,560
Santa Marta gold Colombian punto Rojo

426
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,120
um but

427
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,859
I'm growing out all these varieties

428
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,400
trying to

429
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,318
derive what exactly was there trying to

430
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,298
recreate what was the magic from those

431
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,519
lines and then trying to make something

432
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,279
that is uh

433
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:21,418
new but using the best varieties that we

434
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,818
have or able to use now

435
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,740
oh that's incredible I don't suppose by

436
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,838
any chance you've talked to Bodhi about

437
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,160
this he he kicked that idea around a

438
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,678
year or two ago to me he said someone

439
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,480
should recreate Haze and just and he was

440
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,880
telling me he had a Vietnam that could

441
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,019
work well as the Thai

442
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,460
well actually Bodhi uh Coastal and I

443
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,319
we've been working on this for the last

444
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,880
couple years working on our separate

445
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,220
parts of it so this is an idea that

446
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,140
we've been throwing together trying to

447
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,779
work towards over these last few years

448
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,100
so we're working together trying to get

449
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,599
that uh

450
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,298
to fruition

451
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm so stoked to hear that I he he did

452
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:59,879
tell me that I sort of didn't want to

453
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,319
throw that out there unless you're

454
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,580
comfortable with it so that's that's

455
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:08,579
great no no we're told with that

456
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:11,879
it's exciting I mean you know I I got to

457
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:13,500
chat with a kegu and um he's he's Keen

458
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,980
as well but just to loop back to what

459
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,440
you said so do you believe then that uh

460
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,660
Hayes like a two-parter here do you

461
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,940
believe Hayes has any Indian genetics in

462
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,298
it and as a follow-up recently we had a

463
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,038
gas of Swami on and he said that um he

464
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,019
suspects the tie that we see in Hayes

465
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,200
these days was the squirrel tail do you

466
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,759
have any thoughts on that

467
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,100
okay so there's

468
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,179
when you think of haze Haze has got to

469
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:42,119
be

470
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,679
um what was sold by you know uh

471
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,859
my Neville

472
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,460
and what was done by um previous people

473
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:53,099
in Santa Cruz but this wasn't it's not

474
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,380
old-timer's hits so

475
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,538
um what people think is haze it's got to

476
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,120
be like original Haze that's that's Haze

477
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,500
but Old Timers Hayes is considered a

478
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,939
haze but it's not the same thing so

479
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,339
those are two separate

480
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,960
varieties they're not the same

481
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,439
they may look the same but they're not

482
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,779
the same if that makes any sense

483
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,240
um so the tie the tie that was in it uh

484
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,279
squirrel tail uh who knows which which

485
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,380
one's squirrel tail uh there's different

486
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,980
there's quite a few different squirrel

487
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,679
tail ties there's quite a few mango ties

488
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,660
there's purple ties there's Highland

489
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,640
ties there's purple Highland ties

490
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,840
there's low lintizers uh golden ties

491
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,179
lemon ties

492
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,619
there's so many different ties which one

493
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,538
could it be

494
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,918
um I don't know for sure but I'm trying

495
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,640
to figure that out by growing out all

496
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,259
these different ties

497
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,700
squirrel tail is kind of a

498
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,859
uh

499
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,340
you know a kind of a

500
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:55,379
broad naming of a lot of these strains

501
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,980
the squirrel scale is kind of to depict

502
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,980
these these Thai varieties that have uh

503
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,660
the you know the long colas it would

504
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,419
cause the Zorro they call them in Mexico

505
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,919
you know the the foxtails the squirrel

506
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,320
tail is kind of like the same thing so

507
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,240
it encompasses a lot of these different

508
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,918
Thai stick varieties so it could be a

509
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,319
Thai stick

510
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,340
um or a squirrel tail it's kind of

511
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,619
income in compassionate like a total

512
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,418
name for a lot of different ties but

513
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,159
it's not just one specific tie if that

514
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,820
makes any sense

515
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,940
yeah okay interesting interesting so it

516
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,619
sounds like Colombian definitely plays a

517
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,960
bigger part in it all the more I

518
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:39,779
initially suspected do you think that

519
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,179
people do see tires with a bit of Rose

520
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,440
shade glasses and maybe Colombians do

521
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,179
deserve a bit more interest because

522
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,798
that's largely been my experience that

523
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,600
people seem to be more interested than

524
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,619
in ties than Colombians for the most

525
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,980
part

526
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:54,439
well I think uh ties are very special

527
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,798
um and there's a lot of different ties

528
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,419
so uh but a lot of that is Nostalgia you

529
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,700
know a lot of the 60s and 70s you know

530
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,559
people grew up on sticks

531
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,200
um so there's there's a lot of nostalgia

532
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,178
there but from the haze portion

533
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,880
um a lot of what people love about the

534
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,620
haze is the Purple Haze uh the colors

535
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,220
and a lot of that has to do with

536
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:19,199
Colombian majority of it being Colombian

537
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,919
either all the way Colombian or Mexican

538
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,580
Colombian and then later on

539
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,799
um

540
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,720
they added you know Vietnamese and some

541
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,599
of the other lines

542
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,980
yeah sure so just to look back you

543
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,839
mentioned your friendship with Neville

544
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,659
and this is a discussion Point fans are

545
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:40,079
always interested to hear more about gas

546
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:42,240
from Swami uh said that you know he he

547
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,639
knows Dwight and from what he had heard

548
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,558
there's a few sort of I won't say

549
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
unreleased Neville strains but just some

550
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,399
some of his work floating around that

551
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,079
never really made it out there I'd be

552
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,580
interested to hear your you know sort of

553
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,740
recollection on your friendship with him

554
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,960
and any interesting sort of discussion

555
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,179
points around his work you might be able

556
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,000
to share

557
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,559
uh well Neville he was koi with a lot of

558
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,058
his answers he didn't want to give too

559
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,220
much

560
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,538
um

561
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,339
you know I asked them directly where a

562
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,019
lot of this genetics came from you know

563
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,480
that he brought over

564
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:19,019
um I kind of theorized that

565
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,659
um the guy who did um

566
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,339
that was it since Amelia tips

567
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,480
out of Oregon

568
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,359
um

569
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,000
yeah I I think his name was Tom oh God

570
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,859
I'd have to anyway Tom flowers or

571
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,839
something like no I can't be it's

572
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,939
something I'd have to go back and get

573
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,038
the name but I I kind of theorized that

574
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,600
some of the stuff that he was working at

575
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:42,419
the magazine

576
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:45,298
um he introduced Neville to

577
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:48,659
so that was a portion of those genetics

578
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:51,000
um that he received um the other portion

579
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:55,260
of those genetics came from Jim Ortega

580
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,659
the Ortega Indica the G13

581
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,119
um and a lot of other lines so Jim uh

582
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,880
Jim should get a lot of the credit for a

583
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,839
lot of the genetics that Neville had

584
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,179
um

585
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,359
because a lot of it came from him

586
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,340
uh Neville also said that when he did

587
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,979
breeding he thought that anything that

588
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,899
was bred to like F4 was pretty much true

589
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,220
breeding anything past that was kind of

590
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,960
being redundant

591
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,519
which I kind of argue with it just

592
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,880
depends on the variety

593
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:26,579
yes certainly I mean one of the points

594
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,740
we hear discussed a lot was that

595
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,240
um he was a guy who for some people was

596
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,940
someone who was hard to get along with

597
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,798
you know and a lot of people have sort

598
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,600
of resonated with the idea that for some

599
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,240
people it had to be like a separation of

600
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,399
the art and the artist because he uh

601
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,200
burned a lot of bridges and stuff

602
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,519
at the same time a lot of other people

603
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,319
just have sort of straightforward

604
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,460
friendships with him would you describe

605
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,259
your friendship with him as fairly

606
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,058
straightforward or was he like a complex

607
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,058
guy that he gets described as at times

608
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,980
um

609
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,798
he was definitely complex but he was

610
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,900
also straightforward I mean he had uh he

611
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,480
had sickness as well only we would both

612
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,559
have you know

613
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,240
problems with um

614
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:10,918
in the disease states he had a tick-born

615
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,259
disease kind of like Lyme disease here

616
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:16,799
in the United States it was a tick-born

617
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,058
um uh variety that was attacking his

618
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,900
system

619
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:24,359
um from Australia so he was sick uh was

620
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,200
that tick-borne disease and you know it

621
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,740
definitely

622
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,480
led to his his poor health and um

623
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,980
you know that was difficult for him to

624
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,839
get around and to do things because he

625
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,860
was constantly in pain

626
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,619
um

627
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:39,779
but he definitely wanted to try to he

628
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:42,719
would he wanted to be honest as he could

629
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,619
with what he was doing but um

630
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,298
you know some of the business

631
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:48,000
relationships that he

632
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,819
got into weren't necessarily

633
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,859
thought out

634
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:54,480
you know he he get into it and then um

635
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,819
realized that some of the people flaked

636
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,440
out on him I won't specify who those

637
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:00,178
people were but um

638
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,620
anyway

639
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,140
um

640
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:06,178
yeah he seemed um pretty straightforward

641
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,860
for the most part but there's a lot of

642
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,880
Secrets there that he didn't want people

643
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:10,379
to know

644
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,700
um I don't know if people know but

645
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,600
Neville

646
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,580
he he was in Holland because uh his

647
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,740
family history was from Holland so his

648
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:24,240
family came from Holland but he went

649
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,240
there for treatment for

650
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:29,520
um for Narcotics heroin

651
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,460
um so he's being treated by the the

652
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,778
Dutch government and after going through

653
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,079
treatment

654
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:40,019
um the Dutch give money

655
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,240
um for rebuilding their lives and they

656
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,879
could take that to build a business so

657
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,120
Neville took a loan out and created the

658
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,940
seed bank with that money from the the

659
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:54,778
treatment program which they didn't

660
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,659
really like but um you know that's he

661
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:59,880
was able to create a business that way

662
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,520
um and through his knowledge of fish

663
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,380
breeding he was able to use that

664
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,839
knowledge for fish breeding and to

665
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,820
breeding cannabis and he went searching

666
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,038
for different varieties uh in

667
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,678
Afghanistan and Hungary in different

668
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,759
places trying to get varieties that he

669
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,840
used at the seed bank and then

670
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,579
eventually he went to the United States

671
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,899
and got varieties there

672
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:24,119
yeah that's a great synopsis I um I've

673
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,559
actually heard a few different stories I

674
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,959
suspect yours is correct because you've

675
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:29,700
spoken to him but I've now heard three

676
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,819
or four different animals people say he

677
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,798
was a breeder I've heard Birds dogs cats

678
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:36,240
and now fish I wonder which one it is

679
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,639
probably the fish

680
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,019
fish it was that's what he told me and

681
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,340
that made sense

682
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:45,480
um I don't know about the other ones

683
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:47,819
fish is definitely the way he told me

684
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,220
um and why would you uh you know fish is

685
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:52,859
kind of a strange thing and uh you know

686
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,740
fish multiply and you kind of get the um

687
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:57,240
the Valero Generations that one's f2s

688
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,440
out of it so it makes sense that he used

689
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,058
that

690
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,340
um for his breeding purposes you know

691
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:04,980
he's kind of used you know that type of

692
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:08,099
breeding into what he used for plants

693
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,778
yeah certainly and you touched on the

694
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:12,480
seed bank and I wanted to ask you

695
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:14,519
there's a growing sentiment among the

696
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,679
real heads and breeders that I know of

697
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,019
that is essentially along the lines of

698
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,419
Neville's stock or stock from the seed

699
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,038
bank is some of the most consistent

700
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,778
slash killer stuff you'll ever get

701
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,400
what's your experience with it and do

702
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:28,380
you think it probably is some of the

703
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,059
best gear that was ever available so to

704
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,460
speak

705
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:34,798
um well no I don't necessarily think

706
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,778
it's the best ever the the stuff came a

707
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,000
lot of it came from the United States so

708
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:42,000
it came from like private breeders and

709
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,460
Growers that were you know doing their

710
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,740
own breeding practices and then they

711
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,720
were brought over and then exposed to

712
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,038
the rest of the world

713
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,200
um

714
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:54,720
some of the the earlier stock he was

715
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,980
able to get like in Afghanistan uh was

716
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,360
good at first

717
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,058
um but then it was watered down through

718
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,399
Dutch practices of homogenation and

719
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:05,639
early flowering so these a lot of people

720
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,679
think that that a lot of

721
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,720
Afghani for instance are all

722
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,720
broad-leafed and they're all fast and

723
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,419
you know Indica looking plants they

724
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,240
don't realize that the best varieties of

725
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,159
Afghani were actually narrow Leaf fried

726
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,140
East and those were like the hash

727
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,520
you know for hash

728
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,080
um but they were longer flowering

729
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,259
heirloom varieties

730
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,359
but because in the mid 70s

731
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:33,359
um there was so much

732
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,158
um want for Afghani hashish that they

733
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,079
couldn't keep up with production so back

734
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,778
in the in the past they'd keep you know

735
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:42,058
big wheels of hashish with the family

736
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:45,179
heirlooms and crests imprinted on them

737
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:47,038
but all those old hashish slabs were you

738
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,600
know sold and then they had nothing left

739
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,179
so what they did was incorporate the

740
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,038
heirloom varieties with the the

741
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,320
varieties that were along the the sides

742
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,519
of the roads the more the tribal types

743
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,918
of hash the stuff that was faster

744
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,379
flowering not quite as good but produce

745
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,000
a lot of resin so they Incorporated the

746
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,419
two and then

747
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,859
it watered down The Afghani genomes the

748
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:12,360
the varieties that were people got

749
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:14,939
exposed to after uh like sembi 7 76-77

750
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,038
that started going downhill

751
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,759
um the king got ousted

752
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,640
um

753
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,319
in I think 76

754
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,120
uh 77

755
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,359
um King uh

756
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:29,699
Zaire Shah but he had maybe 30 40 Years

757
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,778
of Peace maybe even longer in

758
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:37,580
Afghanistan and what happened was

759
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:40,679
prior to the paraquant spring in 1979 in

760
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:45,000
Mexico and in Jamaica

761
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:48,778
they the CIA had sprayed paraquat

762
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
um on the poppies and the hash producing

763
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:54,119
plants as well as the food crops in

764
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,038
Afghanistan basically ruining their food

765
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,038
supply so basically starving out the

766
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:02,158
people so once they had permission to do

767
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,200
that they left the CIA and the people

768
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,940
had nothing else to grow so they were

769
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,460
starving Their Food Supplies got ruined

770
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,759
by parapod they were sickened by the

771
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,100
paraquant and so they went back to what

772
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,200
sold and grew the fastest which was

773
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:20,339
Cannabis and poppies

774
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,798
so in in a way we kind of caused

775
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:25,199
um you know the the terrorism and all

776
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:28,079
the stuff that happened later on

777
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,860
um then right after that had happened

778
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:35,038
there was people starving it caused um

779
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:37,678
uh the people to revolt the the King was

780
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,859
ousted the cousin went into being power

781
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,740
and then the Soviets um invaded and then

782
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,058
we know what happened from there

783
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,579
um

784
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:50,339
just like the Taliban

785
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:52,379
um is going back into Afghanistan now

786
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:53,939
and taking control a lot of the

787
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,100
varieties that were

788
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,600
freed up

789
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,519
um after the United States went in there

790
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,980
and started coming available are now

791
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,139
going to be disappearing uh same as what

792
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,179
happened after the Soviets invaded those

793
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,120
varieties that people were

794
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:12,120
um able to get and had you know for many

795
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,278
decades and years had able to get these

796
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,959
nice great afghanis varieties and after

797
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,099
that they weren't able to get these nice

798
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,538
heirloom Afghani lines because of

799
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:23,538
the invasion of the Soviets

800
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,319
but back to the seed bank

801
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,880
um I think that all over the world

802
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,278
there's lots of breeders that have been

803
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,580
growing these lines a lot of land race

804
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:37,398
land races and then develop their own

805
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,778
acclimatized stock

806
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:42,918
those the unsung heroes the the

807
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:45,419
Smugglers uh The Growers the people that

808
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,038
went to Harm's Way to gather these

809
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,759
varieties

810
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,558
um

811
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,980
those those are the people that should

812
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:56,819
be recognized and a lot of that is

813
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,659
um not known so a lot of these heads

814
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:02,639
um you know went through dangerous times

815
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:03,840
of Camp helicopters in California which

816
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,360
is California against marijuana

817
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,658
production very

818
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:11,459
um very harsh and stringent laws against

819
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,960
cannabis

820
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,600
um

821
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,480
but yeah there's a lot of unknown people

822
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,678
that should get credit for the stuff

823
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,740
they did to create some of these

824
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,720
varieties and to sustain them

825
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,058
certainly we've heard that sentiment

826
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,740
before that Neville uh certainly was

827
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:30,240
standing on the shoulders of giants in

828
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,380
what he released and made commercially

829
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,179
available

830
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,799
I'd be interested to know have you been

831
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:36,538
tracking at all

832
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,339
um the the Northern Lights reproductions

833
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:41,819
that have been done by Todd McCormick

834
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:44,220
and CSI slash Matt Riot um it's from

835
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:46,200
Northern Lights Greg who it seems to be

836
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,880
the legit source of Northern Lights do

837
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,720
you have any thoughts on that have you

838
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,880
seen that

839
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,919
honestly I haven't been online so I

840
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,020
don't know what other people are doing

841
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,840
um I've heard stuff

842
00:32:55,019 --> 00:33:00,119
um but I I don't know what they're

843
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,500
claiming or what what it you know I have

844
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,178
really nothing to say about it because I

845
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,558
I don't know

846
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,298
um

847
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,658
I remember getting Northern Lights in

848
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:11,519
the 90s when it wasn't a seed line and

849
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,580
what I remember from the the northern

850
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,658
lights that we got it was a very highly

851
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:21,119
resonance almost blue white crystalline

852
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:22,019
herb very

853
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,178
um

854
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:28,140
very narcotic but also made you high

855
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:31,320
very Stony stuff but unlike the stuff

856
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,360
that was produced by the Dutch later on

857
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,619
that was you know sold as Northern

858
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,839
Lights

859
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:39,178
um so

860
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,459
yeah I don't know what there was a

861
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,759
Northern Lights variety by classic and

862
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,679
his story is that he um he met up with

863
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,658
um Indian gym up in Washington on a

864
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,480
fishing trip and he was able to get some

865
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,799
of the Northern Lights from him so I've

866
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,360
grown that Northern Lights and that

867
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:59,398
one's very strong and uh high quality so

868
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,038
other than that and the Northern Lights

869
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,959
I smoked back in the early 90s

870
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,819
um the the Dutch Northern Lights is

871
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,500
something different what other people

872
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:10,079
are growing I have no idea I'm not

873
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,820
following anybody else so

874
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,460
um can't really say

875
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,740
I would love to quickly ask you what's

876
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,500
your thoughts on nl5 Haze because there

877
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,658
has been a notable Resurgence among you

878
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,119
know consumers and Growers and I guess

879
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:26,639
more broadly it often does get given the

880
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,460
title of sort of the poster child of

881
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,260
cannabis how did you feel about it is it

882
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,760
a special one for you or just a more

883
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,919
well-known one

884
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,139
it's just a more well-known one it's you

885
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:41,398
know it's a

886
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:45,480
a higher yielding hazy-ish

887
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:48,418
um and a conceiva multi-poly hybrid

888
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,800
um I think it gets a lot more

889
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:53,059
um

890
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,060
publicity than it should

891
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,500
there you go well look I mean following

892
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,659
on from that I had a number of questions

893
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,000
but more importantly the fans had a lot

894
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:04,799
of questions about Neville's Hayes and I

895
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,739
guess it speaks to the fact that it is

896
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,599
so rare even now you really don't see it

897
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,118
going around much and people are aware

898
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,220
that you've got a cutting so people were

899
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,539
and myself very keen to hear would you

900
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:17,819
be able to give us a bit of a rundown on

901
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,259
what your Neville's Haze cut is like and

902
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,599
do you plan to work with it going

903
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,280
forward at all well it's not a cutting

904
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,960
it was a seed line

905
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,579
um and the seed line was originally from

906
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,260
Mr Nice

907
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,839
um it was bred to

908
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,160
um F3 and before I breaded to other

909
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:35,039
things

910
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,199
um the phenotype that I chose was

911
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,699
um a large yielding candelabra style so

912
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,480
it had

913
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:41,879
um

914
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,920
you know it had some of that

915
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,559
Northern Light structure but it

916
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,440
basically the haze the larger plant

917
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,320
structure like the Colombians so it had

918
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,420
some bulk but it also contained some of

919
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,920
the haziness to it but it was more like

920
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,740
a Mexican

921
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,780
um creating these long thick bread loaf

922
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:03,419
like colas

923
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,579
um the smell was incensey

924
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,119
um like an Indian Nang Champa but more

925
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:11,839
rich and sweet

926
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,300
um is very um

927
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:17,338
luxurious and unique whenever I'd bring

928
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,539
that to when I was supplying herb to the

929
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:19,739
different medical clubs in the early

930
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:21,719
2000s

931
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:23,279
when I went to the different clubs I'd

932
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,459
you know give samples to the different

933
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,560
Bud tenders and um the female blood

934
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,199
tenders especially love that stuff and

935
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,239
they always wanted more it was uh that

936
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,759
good but the haze was almost near

937
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,858
perfect that that Neville's Haze it was

938
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,300
you get almost as high as you possibly

939
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:41,759
can

940
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,440
um The Taste the smell the aroma it's

941
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,359
all very

942
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,559
uh very good

943
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:52,139
um and I crossed the purple tie uh so it

944
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,779
um you know gets the purple traits

945
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:57,179
um you know the colors the the trichomes

946
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,859
turn purple the resin glands the

947
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:00,179
trichomes are all you know got some

948
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:01,940
colors to them

949
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:04,078
um and that adds a different type of

950
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,358
flavonoid and

951
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,920
um you know Turpin profile then the

952
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,019
regular Neville's Haze by itself makes a

953
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,280
little bit more complex

954
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,800
um

955
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,680
but um it's it's a great and wonderful

956
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,300
plant uh for sure the other Neville's

957
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,699
case is that I've grown

958
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,660
um those ones need to be more sparse um

959
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:26,699
you know very nice but more hazy-ish but

960
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,279
um the one that I used is more of a

961
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:31,858
larger yielding but also retains all the

962
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,540
best qualities that you'd want so like a

963
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,219
large yielding Haze it's like what you

964
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:37,380
want

965
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:41,219
um as far as yields and Buds and the the

966
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,960
density in a modern variety but with all

967
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:45,679
the qualities I like the longest

968
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,300
flowering cases almost

969
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:51,299
if that makes any sense

970
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,880
that's amazing why you brought it up I

971
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,300
guess I'll quickly touch on it I also

972
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,940
noted that you had the Oregon purple tie

973
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,940
is that correct

974
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:06,300
um no I didn't have Oregon purple tie I

975
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,858
have a chocolate tie that I believe

976
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:14,339
um was the source of what created

977
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:16,139
the organ purple tie which is um

978
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:19,858
a Highland

979
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:22,078
um oaxacan gold and the chocolate tie to

980
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:23,699
create the working purple tie except the

981
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,579
chocolate pie doesn't have any of the

982
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:28,199
mutations and weird [ __ ] that's sorry

983
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,359
weird stuff that's associated with

984
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,078
Morgan purple tie

985
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:33,900
um

986
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,859
so it's got the colors it's got the the

987
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:40,619
highs everything that you like about

988
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:43,019
flow blueberry

989
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,960
um I believe a majority of that comes

990
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:48,480
from that chocolate tie which

991
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,940
um I believe is a purple tie

992
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,179
but we haven't gotten there to verify it

993
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,700
so I believe that is uh

994
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:58,980
you know the rootstock of Oregon purple

995
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:01,078
tying and I bred that into some

996
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,099
varieties I've released a little bit of

997
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,140
it

998
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:10,099
um so far but I lost the mother

999
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:12,299
unfortunately during my aunt's funeral

1000
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:14,220
this last Christmas

1001
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,660
I have a little bit of seed stock left

1002
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:20,039
I'm going to try to revive but what I've

1003
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:21,179
bred into it is still still available so

1004
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,980
um

1005
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:24,480
there will be some magic still and then

1006
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,320
I'm working with other chocolate ties

1007
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,199
but um yeah it's uh

1008
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,240
it's definitely a special line

1009
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,338
that's fantastic thanks for the

1010
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,098
clarification and I guess as a follow-up

1011
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,960
I noticed you've got the blueberry blast

1012
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,000
which you know really cool strain it's

1013
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,099
got the blueberry and the Neville's Haze

1014
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,780
in there I guess I was sort of wondering

1015
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,220
how would you describe that one like how

1016
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,900
did it turn out it sounds like it could

1017
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,939
be like a better version of Blue Dream

1018
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,800
to me and as a follow-up what's your

1019
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,300
thoughts on the blueberry family in

1020
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,740
general are you fond of it or you know

1021
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,720
it's just sort of one of the things for

1022
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,699
you

1023
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,559
uh well more to start let's start on the

1024
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:03,239
uh the blueberry blast so I made the

1025
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:04,920
blueberry blast

1026
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:07,739
um when I was supplying the medical

1027
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,900
clubs in Southern California we were

1028
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,939
growing in Northern California

1029
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,180
um

1030
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,099
our our family farm is in the Emerald

1031
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:19,980
Triangle area

1032
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,380
um so I was able to see what was selling

1033
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,639
in the medical clubs and one of them was

1034
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,000
blue dream

1035
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,440
um so I was this is before I got famous

1036
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,380
so I went to

1037
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,480
you know where I was growing and found

1038
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,039
the different cuts they were going there

1039
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,139
was two different cuts

1040
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,019
um a blue dream and then I grew those

1041
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:40,920
commercially uh that same year

1042
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,719
um

1043
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,400
and this is before most people knew

1044
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:46,439
about blue dream

1045
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,200
um so I read two versions of it called

1046
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,740
pipe dream and blueberry blast

1047
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:55,799
um the narrow Leaf more hazy version

1048
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:58,379
um blue dream uh was bred into the pipe

1049
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,720
train and the male uh for that was the

1050
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,400
Acapulco called c99 male

1051
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,838
uh the blueberry blast had the Johnny

1052
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,280
Blaze which is Neville's Hayes and

1053
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,299
blueberry

1054
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,300
um it was

1055
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:13,679
slightly larger yielding that blue dream

1056
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,959
uh the leaves were a little bit more

1057
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,879
broader not by much

1058
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,880
um resin production was a little bit

1059
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,400
more on the the the narrow Leaf one for

1060
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,338
the pipe dream but they were both

1061
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,559
awesome and very close and um

1062
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:30,779
effects and yields

1063
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,119
um the quality

1064
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,359
of the the pie cream was just slightly

1065
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,559
better in my opinion I liked it more uh

1066
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:39,960
than the one I used for the blueberry

1067
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,019
blast but the blueberry blast was my

1068
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,579
version of a commercial

1069
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:47,179
a commercial variety

1070
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,180
um it was

1071
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,659
um the best Blue Dream at the time and

1072
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,700
um you know basically trying to make it

1073
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,159
better so there there's quite a few

1074
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:58,559
phenotypes most of them are larger

1075
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,239
yielding some of them are more hazy uh

1076
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,219
but you can have a seven week blueberry

1077
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,959
blast uh for some of the faster

1078
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,000
phenotypes and then you can have one

1079
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,579
that goes to 14 to 16 weeks for

1080
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,320
something longer but um all of them are

1081
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:14,160
super residents have that blueberry

1082
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,740
Cedar uh wood Aroma

1083
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,539
um very luscious and tasty effect is

1084
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:22,078
kind of like Strawberry Cough it's got

1085
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:25,079
that original Haze type high so you get

1086
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,599
really high for a few hours and then

1087
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,060
um it'll allow you to eat Munchies or

1088
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,280
eat if you like and sleep if you want in

1089
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,219
a nice dreamful restful state so it's

1090
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,420
kind of like a

1091
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:38,879
all-encompassing high and you know it

1092
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,740
kind of lets you go up and then takes

1093
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,680
you down if you need to do what you need

1094
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:45,358
to do and be restful because some uh

1095
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:46,919
Haze and sensitivas kind of will keep

1096
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,858
you amped for a while and it can be

1097
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,019
tiring it can kind of wear you out but

1098
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,338
that kind of allows you to do what you

1099
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:55,440
need to do

1100
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:57,480
when you want to

1101
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,940
yeah beautiful stuff and what's your

1102
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,400
thoughts on the sort of work by DJ in

1103
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,700
general I guess I'll preface this that I

1104
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,260
noticed you you do the grape Crush F3 so

1105
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:09,419
I'd be Keen to hear your thoughts on

1106
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,060
that one I guess you're fond of it

1107
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,000
the great crush is uh awesome uh

1108
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:17,578
beautiful line very strong

1109
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,139
um has some mutants has a lot of the the

1110
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:22,079
DJ stuff does

1111
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:25,139
um but it you know keeps it interesting

1112
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,859
um you know it's very strong potent

1113
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:29,639
um you know smaller yielding indica

1114
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:31,619
um

1115
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:34,139
breeds well with other lines I made some

1116
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:36,180
very powerful varieties breeding with it

1117
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:39,118
it's very tasty

1118
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:40,259
some phenotypes are better than others

1119
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,640
um

1120
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,560
yeah

1121
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:45,539
um the blueberry lines a lot of the

1122
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,880
stuff is um

1123
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:50,338
it was better at one point than it is

1124
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,900
now it seems uh some of the genetics

1125
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:54,239
were

1126
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,680
more pure at that point I think it's

1127
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,439
kind of

1128
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,539
Uh something's changed over the time and

1129
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,059
I think DJ has said it was the afghani's

1130
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:05,039
war kind of added more into it and it

1131
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:07,619
kind of seems more evident with like the

1132
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,719
flow the flow seemed to be more

1133
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,980
um Mexican

1134
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:12,539
um

1135
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,539
uh

1136
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:18,059
more Mexican and

1137
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:21,659
yield and percentages than it is

1138
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:23,039
nowadays now you get more of Afghani

1139
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,618
um

1140
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,139
Centric type of variety with a lot of

1141
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,838
these uh flow and and blueberry types

1142
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:33,838
the blueberries that I had back in 97

1143
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:35,818
was super tasty flavorful

1144
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:38,338
um the stuff now is also very flavorful

1145
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:40,199
but um the the phenotypes are kind of

1146
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:43,619
all over the place but um you know

1147
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:45,960
awesome stuff you know good breeding

1148
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,818
um well if you're looking for specific

1149
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,420
plants to grow they're great breeding

1150
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:53,400
can be a little odd because of

1151
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,420
the multi-poly hybrid

1152
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,480
um

1153
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,099
aspects of the lines in general I mean

1154
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,380
while we're sort of talking about

1155
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:02,579
strains of yesteryear I'd love to

1156
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,619
quickly ask you you know were there any

1157
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:07,800
a notable one for that we hear a lot on

1158
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,838
the show is like the sssc did they ever

1159
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,220
put out any notable things for you or

1160
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,619
were there any other brands from around

1161
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:15,419
that time that really stick out in your

1162
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:17,280
mind is quite memorable

1163
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,079
well SSC

1164
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,540
um

1165
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,359
well I I got to know uh one of the

1166
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:26,519
people that did the shipping for sssc

1167
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,759
and some of the strains that he was

1168
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:33,059
growing uh sssc super sativa seed Club

1169
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,460
had Incorporated in their lines so the

1170
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:38,219
what's known as Williams Wonder was

1171
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,380
actually my friend's strain and um

1172
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:42,838
I I don't want to say where he's from

1173
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,940
but he's from the United States

1174
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:49,019
um and um

1175
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:52,740
his name was also my name uh but the

1176
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:56,280
other name for uh John is William so

1177
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:58,259
Williams Wonder was one of his strains

1178
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,880
um the Hawaiians were also associated

1179
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,460
with my friend

1180
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,780
um and some of the other varieties uh as

1181
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,780
well who's her Hooten holler

1182
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:12,480
um so just like uh him you know he was

1183
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:14,179
able to incorporate to what a lot of

1184
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,858
people loved about

1185
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:18,719
sssc just like Neville you know got

1186
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,098
stuff from other people

1187
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,000
um and shared that with the rest of the

1188
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:26,099
world so he should be noted as being you

1189
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,139
know something that people uh got

1190
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,180
something really that they enjoyed from

1191
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:32,539
this individual

1192
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:35,519
um some of the the varieties from SSC

1193
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,900
were the same as the seed banks

1194
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,239
um

1195
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,539
basic five was the Neville's uh sorry

1196
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:45,239
the Northern Lights number five uh the

1197
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:48,300
basic five skunk was like uh skunk

1198
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:50,098
Northern Lights crosses or like Shiva

1199
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,839
skunk so a lot of the stuff was just

1200
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:55,200
renamed with some of the same cuttings

1201
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:58,440
that were available to um

1202
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,759
um to the seed bank and sscc in Holland

1203
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,139
at the time

1204
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,260
um the

1205
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:07,559
what people known as the um

1206
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:11,160
Pine Town Durban uh Pinetown is actually

1207
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:14,099
a town in or a little uh District in

1208
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:16,739
Durban so it's not a Piney uh Durban

1209
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:19,760
it's just from that part of uh Durban

1210
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:22,379
and South Africa

1211
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,300
a lot of people there's the South

1212
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,619
African um

1213
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:30,060
crosses South African is the Durban

1214
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:32,519
in those crosses

1215
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:34,619
okay

1216
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,239
it doesn't doesn't it doesn't say that

1217
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,700
but it says South African but the South

1218
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,618
African is actually the urban it doesn't

1219
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:42,838
say on the description but if you see

1220
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,059
South African it's Durban and then

1221
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:47,460
whatever the cross is

1222
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:50,159
ah there you go and a lot of people

1223
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,500
speculate that the common Durban

1224
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,318
cuttings floating around the USA at the

1225
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,179
moment the notable ones have maybe some

1226
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:59,279
Afghan crossed into them do you have any

1227
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:01,139
thoughts on that

1228
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,880
well I know a lot of the Dutch ones

1229
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:05,039
definitely seem uh like they have

1230
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,619
skunked to them the ones that are in the

1231
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,679
United States I don't know

1232
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,680
um

1233
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:15,599
um there was

1234
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:18,000
um Durbin that was associated with one

1235
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,800
of the uh guys that did some of the

1236
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,039
Cannabis books

1237
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,980
um it wasn't Rosenthal it was um

1238
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,259
the other gentleman the name uh is

1239
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,420
escaping me at the moment and this is a

1240
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,220
an older gentleman

1241
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:36,119
um Mel Frank

1242
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:36,838
uh Mel Frank yeah Mel actually went to

1243
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,059
um

1244
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:42,599
Durbin and brought back some seeds so a

1245
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:45,659
lot of what people got one of the stock

1246
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,099
that was released as like Durbin and

1247
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:50,098
then I think some of the seed banks in

1248
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,200
in Holland got was his Durban Poison but

1249
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,380
what a lot of uh some of the Growers

1250
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:59,939
were growing in Mendocino was different

1251
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:01,500
versions of his Urban Poison yeah so a

1252
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,380
lot what people see are these little

1253
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,838
stocky uh Durban poisons that's kind of

1254
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,539
like from his stock but Durban Poison is

1255
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:12,239
actually a hybrid of

1256
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:14,460
um some of the Bantu tribe

1257
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:18,118
um that came from Northern Africa down

1258
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,920
to South Africa to Swaziland and

1259
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,358
um

1260
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:26,099
the Zulu Nation

1261
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:29,639
um and then the uh uh East the the

1262
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,980
Eastern Cape tribes those varieties got

1263
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:34,440
mixed in with what was um

1264
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,559
later came in from the indentured Indian

1265
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:42,440
servants uh in the 1800s from Mostly

1266
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:45,239
South South India from like Kerala orisa

1267
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,760
Andhra Pradesh and then a small

1268
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:51,059
percentage from himal Pradesh in the

1269
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,800
northern Indian area but majority of the

1270
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:57,299
Indians that were indentured servants

1271
00:49:52,800 --> 00:50:00,480
basically uh you know slaves but were

1272
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,940
moved from South India to work the sugar

1273
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,400
plantations after the free the black

1274
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,559
slaves this also happened in the West

1275
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,480
Indies in like Jamaica the indentured

1276
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:11,699
servants came to work the sugar

1277
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,380
plantations and that's where you get

1278
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:15,539
some of the Jamaican varieties which

1279
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,720
were

1280
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:21,679
um Indian and Mexican and then later on

1281
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:25,019
were Indian Colombian

1282
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,838
interesting uh but Durban Poison is a

1283
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:30,358
combination of

1284
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:32,039
African and South Indian

1285
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:34,440
uh that's why some of them are more

1286
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:37,019
Compact and bushy and then other ones

1287
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,818
more power like a Malawi

1288
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:40,980
um or some Malawi

1289
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:42,779
but um that there's one there's

1290
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,579
definitely some variations with the

1291
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,980
Durban poisons it's not just one variety

1292
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:49,318
and that's why I think a lot of people

1293
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,420
um Mis misunderstand it's not just uh

1294
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:53,880
it's an heirloom land race now but it's

1295
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,300
acclimatized over a period of time due

1296
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,280
to two people's uh coming together

1297
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:02,339
Lesotho is a version of the same thing

1298
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,500
going on where it's like banshu tribes

1299
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:06,960
mixed with

1300
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,420
um North Indian because some of the um

1301
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,740
the the lesota varieties are very Stoney

1302
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,300
and physical

1303
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:14,639
so it makes more sense that that

1304
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,318
hybridization is a combination of the

1305
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,818
two

1306
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,279
yeah

1307
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:21,719
interesting interesting and I mean you

1308
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,359
just mentioned you know the Indian

1309
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:27,419
genetics why do you think they're so

1310
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,400
sort of underrepresented compared to a

1311
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,079
lot of other land races do you think

1312
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,599
they've got something to offer that a

1313
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,818
lot of people might be overlooking

1314
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,400
oh absolutely there's a lot of varieties

1315
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:39,960
in India they were growing cannabis for

1316
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,338
many many years

1317
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,500
um

1318
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:44,940
um for the people for food purposes for

1319
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,960
medicine

1320
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,119
um

1321
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,519
so yeah uh there's definitely a lot of

1322
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,300
stuff under Representatives

1323
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:54,358
um

1324
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:56,940
why it's not getting the notorious like

1325
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:59,578
uh you know um

1326
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,838
the highlights like other varieties

1327
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:03,960
um

1328
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:06,960
it all depends maybe it's been watered

1329
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:10,679
down by mixing up so many varieties

1330
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,780
um you know uh some of the

1331
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:15,058
Indian varieties you know they they

1332
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,540
create a lot of hashish from it so it's

1333
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,700
hard to drive to like see the different

1334
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:24,000
varieties from one another

1335
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:26,639
um you know some of the Colombians are

1336
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,280
more uh you know colorful as far as

1337
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,618
standing out as a sativa so maybe people

1338
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,980
will see the Colombians standing out

1339
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:36,480
more so uh like with a haze

1340
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,639
um

1341
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,358
the Indians I think

1342
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:41,219
um

1343
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:45,058
don't get the credit they need to

1344
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:46,919
there's such a wide area of growth and

1345
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,240
geographical

1346
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,240
um peoples there's so many different

1347
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:54,539
people uh such a long history

1348
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:57,838
um they had the what it was called soma

1349
00:52:54,539 --> 00:53:00,300
which was you know the sacred uh

1350
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,179
cannabis now just like the Persians had

1351
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:06,660
heoma the zoastrian religion

1352
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:10,078
um pre you know Afghan area

1353
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:15,358
um but you know what was

1354
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:18,539
once uh an area of long cannabis history

1355
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:21,299
um has been you know separated by

1356
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:25,679
religion so a lot of what was India

1357
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:29,339
previous to like the 1950s was you know

1358
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:32,039
where Pakistan is now at Bangladesh

1359
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:33,119
um all that what is India was all of

1360
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:35,279
that

1361
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,900
um previous to that point

1362
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,579
um just you know a mix of different

1363
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,338
peoples

1364
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:43,859
um so uh you know there's a lot of stuff

1365
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:45,239
that should be revived and a lot of that

1366
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:45,960
knowledge

1367
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:47,879
um

1368
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,019
you know should be explored more a lot

1369
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,180
of different varieties and I think

1370
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:54,480
there's some good people from the Indian

1371
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:56,759
Land race exchange by raising some other

1372
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,260
people that are trying to put some more

1373
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,780
focus on these varieties than these

1374
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:03,000
Farmers that should be supported because

1375
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,980
a lot of these people are starving you

1376
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,019
know they're not giving much for their

1377
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,760
cannabis they're not getting much to

1378
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:09,659
live on in general

1379
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,000
um

1380
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:14,699
so I think a lot of governments should

1381
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,260
support these people these uh histories

1382
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:17,759
of these cannabis varieties because it's

1383
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,520
not only uh

1384
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,619
you know a history of these people the

1385
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,579
Cannabis is kind of like

1386
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:28,619
a sociological social history it's um

1387
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:30,359
it's something that they can grow that's

1388
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:32,818
also a history of those people it's

1389
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:36,358
knowledge it passed down from you know

1390
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:37,739
father to son to mother to daughter and

1391
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:39,900
should be treasured and there's so much

1392
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:41,399
history there that we just haven't been

1393
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,680
able to um

1394
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,338
let the rest of the world know and

1395
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:50,699
hopefully with time we can kind of show

1396
00:54:47,338 --> 00:54:52,739
people more of what's out there

1397
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:55,318
most certainly definitely need to have

1398
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:57,659
more attention placed on the indigenous

1399
00:54:55,318 --> 00:55:00,719
farmers and supporting them

1400
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:02,818
I guess you you sort of touched on the

1401
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:05,578
farmers and a conversation I've been

1402
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:08,400
having more so with friends in private

1403
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:11,220
sort of goes along the lines of

1404
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,420
is what we're doing with modern cannabis

1405
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:16,500
breeding

1406
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:18,420
really that good compared to what the

1407
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,159
indigenous farmers were doing because it

1408
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,599
seems as if we're losing a lot of the

1409
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,000
special stuff

1410
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,640
and a lot of people complain about how

1411
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,380
there's this sort of same everything has

1412
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,058
this same quality you know everything in

1413
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,838
the dispensary sort of feels about the

1414
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,339
same

1415
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:34,380
what's your thoughts on this it's

1416
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:35,818
obviously a deep philosophical Rabbit

1417
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,140
Hole to jump down but I'd love to hear

1418
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:38,639
your take

1419
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:40,500
well I don't think it's it's that

1420
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:44,279
difficult I think a lot of what people

1421
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:46,679
are growing and are exposed to are what

1422
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:51,000
was created from the seed banks so a lot

1423
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:52,558
of seed banks were Northern Lights skunk

1424
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,880
um and then that was incorporated to

1425
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,359
almost everything

1426
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,400
so everything's a skunk Afghani Northern

1427
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:02,460
Lights type high but only from certain

1428
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,380
varieties The Afghani varieties that the

1429
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,900
Dutch were growing I hate to pick on the

1430
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,240
Dutch but this is what was happening to

1431
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,940
grow varieties that would be more

1432
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:15,779
conducive to indoor flowering they

1433
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:17,519
selected plants that would finish Fast

1434
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,140
um would be more homogeneous meaning

1435
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,480
they would

1436
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:23,279
um flower and then the whole plant would

1437
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,960
flower at one time instead of flowering

1438
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,000
and you know

1439
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,880
stages

1440
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,880
um so when you pick plants that are

1441
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,980
early flowering and you know and

1442
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,079
homogeneous

1443
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,500
um you're actually selecting the

1444
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:43,140
qualities that aren't as potent I mean

1445
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,079
you could if you get lucky but when you

1446
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:47,338
pick out varieties that aren't disease

1447
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,260
resistant

1448
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:51,838
um aren't for potency aren't for Quality

1449
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,740
you're losing the best parts of the

1450
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:54,599
plant

1451
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:56,399
and so you're watering them down so

1452
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,200
unfortunately they were watering down

1453
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,800
the genetics

1454
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:04,919
um to fit a need because of

1455
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:08,760
um the illegal state of cannabis that's

1456
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,659
been happening since the 1930s

1457
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,000
um

1458
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:13,799
you know cannabis was illegal so they

1459
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
had to go indoors for the most part so

1460
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,119
they were breeding varieties that would

1461
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,679
go grow indoors easily for people so the

1462
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:23,220
Dutch were doing this as a convenience

1463
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:24,299
which made sense but unfortunately

1464
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:27,239
um they watered down a lot of the

1465
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:29,400
genetics and another thing that happened

1466
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:32,818
was the genetic socks that they had were

1467
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:36,000
great but as they were trying to keep

1468
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:38,219
germination fresh seed available to the

1469
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,679
customers they were killing off or

1470
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:42,358
destroying their old seed stock the

1471
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:45,058
problem was as they were watering down

1472
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:48,179
their varieties for fast maturing

1473
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:49,500
you know homogeneous plants they can go

1474
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:50,879
back to their old seed stock because

1475
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,338
they destroyed it because we're trying

1476
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,900
to keep up and keep fresh seed stock

1477
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:57,358
so the only thing that they had were

1478
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,680
these old clones but the seed stock

1479
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:00,659
wasn't something they could go back to

1480
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,519
unless they had you know long-term

1481
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:05,279
storage or something they could but they

1482
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:08,940
destroyed a lot of genetic

1483
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,440
um germplasm unfortunately and that's

1484
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,480
why

1485
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,760
you know they're searching around the

1486
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,579
world for new varieties or old varieties

1487
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,680
that farmers were growing in the United

1488
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:21,960
States around the world Australia or

1489
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,279
different countries now because of what

1490
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,139
happened with the poor breeding

1491
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,540
practices so

1492
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:28,379
breeding for potency quality is what I

1493
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:30,599
do

1494
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,640
and foremost everything else you can

1495
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:34,380
narrow down you can pick for faster

1496
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:35,818
flowering plants out of those once

1497
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,798
you've acquired something that's strong

1498
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:40,318
and has the qualities you want you know

1499
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:43,079
colors taste Aroma all that stuff can be

1500
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,759
fixed but if you got a weak plant that

1501
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,339
doesn't have the qualities

1502
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,760
uh that you know make it unique then

1503
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:52,500
it's not special so the majority of what

1504
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,599
people are growing out there are fast

1505
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:57,420
growing you know great for production

1506
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:59,700
you know great for a farmer but the

1507
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:03,659
people that are smoking are getting

1508
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:05,639
the the end result of what is good for

1509
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:08,759
the farmer but not good for the grow for

1510
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:11,879
the smoker so uh people if they want

1511
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,980
these higher quality strains should ask

1512
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,838
um you know breeding practices to evolve

1513
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,019
where some of the better higher quality

1514
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:21,659
plants are made to yield more

1515
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:23,940
and then also request you're getting

1516
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:27,358
ping uh the farmers more for something

1517
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:29,818
that may take longer to grow but has a

1518
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:31,500
higher quality uh that these smokers

1519
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:34,679
would like to enjoy because there's so

1520
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,260
much more out there that's possible but

1521
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:39,358
they're just not being able or being

1522
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,940
exposed to it because

1523
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:44,880
um the lack of availability and the lack

1524
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,679
of commercial Growers growing these

1525
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,599
varieties because they just don't yield

1526
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:51,838
as much so if you have a plant that

1527
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:55,019
yields five pounds in another plant that

1528
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,940
yields a couple ounces you're gonna grow

1529
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:58,559
the the plant that grows five pounds

1530
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,900
because even if you sell it super cheap

1531
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,579
you're still getting a lot more money

1532
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,260
for the farmers so the farmer's just

1533
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:05,880
thinking you know apples and oranges

1534
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,500
they're growing these things because

1535
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,539
they're trying to sell them you know

1536
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,460
they're trying to make money but it it

1537
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:13,380
doesn't make any sense for a farmer to

1538
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,639
grow something that barely yields

1539
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,780
anything if they're not going to get

1540
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,539
much for it

1541
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,920
so that's unfortunate reason why people

1542
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:21,298
aren't getting exposed to these

1543
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,400
varieties

1544
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:26,039
um because it's just not worth the

1545
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:29,880
farmer's time because the smokers aren't

1546
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:31,679
paying for that extra time spent to grow

1547
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,059
these varieties which take longer and

1548
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,039
don't yield as much

1549
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:38,280
eventually some of these strains you can

1550
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:40,920
get the higher yielding plants

1551
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,780
with the higher qualities like I try to

1552
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,720
incorporate with some of my varieties

1553
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:48,180
but sometimes you just need to spend

1554
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:50,039
extra time to grow them because

1555
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:54,419
people are missing out on the best

1556
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:57,779
quality highs and experiences and if you

1557
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:00,119
grew up on cushes and indicas you may

1558
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:02,099
have not ever gotten high you've just

1559
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:03,358
been stoned and people just don't

1560
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:05,760
understand that high you don't

1561
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,460
understand that you can get happy and

1562
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,559
giggly and you know laugh yourself into

1563
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,059
fits and you know laugh so hard that

1564
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,700
your your stomach hurts and you start

1565
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:16,980
spitting up and it's it's a great

1566
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:19,259
wonderful experience and there's so many

1567
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:22,559
different highs that give you happiness

1568
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,940
and Euphoria and colors and there's a

1569
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,200
lot of magic out there and just most

1570
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,960
people haven't been able to experience

1571
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,939
that unfortunately

1572
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,920
you mentioned it yourself just then that

1573
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:34,139
you tried to breed some strains that

1574
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,298
have that high quality and the increased

1575
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:38,159
yield to accompany it for all the

1576
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:39,900
listeners out there whose ears have

1577
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:41,519
perked up do you want to throw some

1578
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,260
recommendations out there what have your

1579
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:44,880
Australians fit that bill if for anyone

1580
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,099
who's Keen to try

1581
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,380
uh well one of them would be uh the

1582
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,260
dragon's fire it's um mostly Thai

1583
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:54,180
Hawaiian but it's got the longer flying

1584
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:58,260
tie highs

1585
01:01:54,179 --> 01:02:00,000
um but with more of a Hawaiian modern

1586
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,520
resin profile so you get the larger

1587
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,139
yields and resin from like a modern

1588
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:05,280
variety so you get the yields and looks

1589
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:08,818
that everyone wants and smells and

1590
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,980
tastes so it smells tasty wonderful like

1591
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:13,619
pineapple tropical fruits but you get

1592
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:17,579
these wonderful soaring highs euphoric

1593
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:19,200
energy that just makes you happy unlike

1594
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:23,059
many other varieties so that'd be one

1595
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,058
but there are so many that

1596
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:26,880
um I could mention blueberry blast was a

1597
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:28,739
good one although I have to

1598
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,900
um remake the variety because I'm sold

1599
01:02:28,739 --> 01:02:34,259
out but that was another connoisseur

1600
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:36,119
commercial variety it yielded very well

1601
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,160
um it was great for Growers and it was

1602
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,500
great for smokers so it was kind of

1603
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,179
all-encompassing uh there's many

1604
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,219
varieties like that but there's also for

1605
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:47,279
like the true connoisseur

1606
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:49,679
um you know you get these modern resin

1607
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,260
profiles but with the um the longer

1608
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:55,679
flowering pies associated with you know

1609
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:58,980
ties Colombians that sort of thing

1610
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,598
wow that sounds really special I mean a

1611
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:04,318
few questions back you referenced the

1612
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:06,539
Acapulco Gold c99 male and I noticed you

1613
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:08,099
use that quite a bit do those crosses

1614
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:10,019
also fit the bill in a sense because

1615
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:12,180
they seem like you know fun uplifting

1616
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:13,739
sativa do they have the yield as well or

1617
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:14,639
are they more for a different sort of

1618
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:17,338
cross

1619
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,139
actually a lot of those were for um you

1620
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:21,179
know commercial purposes so you get a

1621
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:25,259
higher quality

1622
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:29,578
um commercial viable but with the highs

1623
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:30,299
that people want so yeah so the c99

1624
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:34,920
um

1625
01:03:30,298 --> 01:03:38,280
Acapulco Gold varieties were more of uh

1626
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:41,760
uh more of a trying to get people to try

1627
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:43,859
out some of these lines but with um a

1628
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,220
semi-moderate flowering period so it's

1629
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:49,318
fast enough for many people but it takes

1630
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:52,379
a little bit longer than some but you

1631
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:54,838
get high quality unlike a lot of writing

1632
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:57,240
so you don't get the same

1633
01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:59,880
um generic High

1634
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:02,459
yeah sure that sounds like a great sort

1635
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:05,160
of Middle Ground you've touched on it a

1636
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,900
bit and I'd love to delve deeper into it

1637
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:09,239
with there's a lot of discussion

1638
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:11,940
currently around what is it that

1639
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:14,519
actually causes us to perceive something

1640
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,920
as an indica versus a sativa and I've

1641
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:19,139
heard people more recently say oh it's

1642
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,240
it's all the terpenes but I remembered

1643
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:23,818
having a discussion with Bodie I believe

1644
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:26,699
it was and he said to me I've got this

1645
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:29,099
Afghani that smells like this tie I've

1646
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:30,960
got and they both test that like you

1647
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:33,780
know about the same like let's say they

1648
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,179
both test it 20 and they both smell the

1649
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:38,579
same but one's clearly indica and one's

1650
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:40,558
clearly sativa and it got me thinking

1651
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,720
like yeah like what really is it because

1652
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:45,480
I'm not so sold it's terpenes but I'd

1653
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:48,500
love to hear more and be educated

1654
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,880
well a lot of people they they call

1655
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,920
multi-poly hybrids sativas when they

1656
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,619
have an up high

1657
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,659
um and they call indica's uh they have

1658
01:04:55,619 --> 01:05:01,440
narcotic Stony High you know Estonia

1659
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:04,980
effects um you know indica

1660
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,659
um the truth is that the nomenclature

1661
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,480
the names for all this stuff is kind of

1662
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:11,219
all over the place uh sativa would

1663
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,440
typically be like a tropical or

1664
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:14,879
equatorial variety

1665
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,920
um but it doesn't have to be because

1666
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,559
there's microclimates everywhere so like

1667
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:22,260
in Afghanistan there's also sativas

1668
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:24,780
uh there's narrow Leaf varieties

1669
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:28,020
um they have the up Highs but you can

1670
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,940
also have a sativa that has a narcotic

1671
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:33,000
effect

1672
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:34,920
um so you know it depends are people

1673
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,059
calling the sativa because it's got

1674
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:43,920
narrow leaves in a you know um

1675
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:46,380
a upright you know smaller flower set

1676
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,720
um with the up high a sativa but if it

1677
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,358
has a narcotic effect is that an indica

1678
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:54,118
or is it a sativa it's still a sativa

1679
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,318
but it's got a narcotic effect

1680
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:57,358
so

1681
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:59,099
um the chemotypes associated with a lot

1682
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,558
of these varieties

1683
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:02,579
um

1684
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,740
basically a lot of stuff should be

1685
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:07,519
renamed and indica should be anything

1686
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:10,259
that should be from India you know

1687
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:12,179
India but um

1688
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:15,299
there should be hash plants there should

1689
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:17,519
be equatorials there should be Tropicals

1690
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:19,739
um there should be jungle varieties

1691
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,298
there should be Highland there should be

1692
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:22,858
low end

1693
01:06:21,298 --> 01:06:25,019
um more of the environment that's

1694
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:27,960
associated with and the type of plant it

1695
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:29,338
is is it a hash plant or is it a ganja

1696
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,139
plant is it something that you smoke for

1697
01:06:29,338 --> 01:06:32,460
flowers or is it something that you

1698
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:35,219
harvest for hash

1699
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:37,380
or is it a hash like plant

1700
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:38,578
um so Indica sativa

1701
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,619
um

1702
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,359
you know it's kind of too broad and

1703
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:44,039
people use it for you know they say OG

1704
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:48,358
cushions sativa because it's kind of up

1705
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:50,400
high well obviously it's an Indica but

1706
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:52,619
you know just because as up high doesn't

1707
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,858
mean it's a sativa

1708
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:58,260
clear as mud

1709
01:06:54,858 --> 01:07:01,078
yeah I mean I think as the you know the

1710
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,880
extension of that what do you think is

1711
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:04,260
the mechanism through which it's

1712
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,720
different you know do you think there's

1713
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,880
maybe some yet to be characterized

1714
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:11,159
molecules and like if they're there they

1715
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,780
give you that more uplifting effect or

1716
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:13,879
how do you think it plays out because it

1717
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:17,519
seems like a lot of the current

1718
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,599
speculation is sort of yet to be proven

1719
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,239
I guess

1720
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,920
well there there's a lot of unknowns in

1721
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:24,779
cannabis mostly of what people have been

1722
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:26,639
studying is the cannabinoids and the

1723
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,980
turpins the primary trippings but

1724
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:32,759
there's also long chain Turpin profiles

1725
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:35,400
so there's these things that insects

1726
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:37,740
ward off against because

1727
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,318
um the plant is giving off

1728
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:42,000
um a Turpin profile that is like a

1729
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,420
pesticide

1730
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,699
um also it um you know acts as like a

1731
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:49,260
hormone for humans but for the plant

1732
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,879
species

1733
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,740
um so there's these unknown Turpin

1734
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,099
profiles that

1735
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:58,199
um we have yet to record all of them so

1736
01:07:56,099 --> 01:08:00,359
we don't even know

1737
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,798
all that are out there so we need to

1738
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:03,779
identify them and then we need to

1739
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:05,639
identify what their properties are

1740
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:08,460
because they work with the primary

1741
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:09,598
turpins to have the tertiary effect you

1742
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,159
know they add they go with the

1743
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,579
cannabinoids and their primary turbines

1744
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:17,939
to add to the overall

1745
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:20,880
um effects there's also these flavonoids

1746
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:26,939
um that you know cause colors and these

1747
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:30,600
cause effects and defects on a nerve can

1748
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:32,879
result in that nerve firing

1749
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,859
um for a longer period of time or

1750
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,480
shorter period of time think of a sine

1751
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:39,900
wave you know those things you see on

1752
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,698
like an EKG that you know goes straight

1753
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:45,960
and then it goes up and then goes down

1754
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:47,879
that is let's just say a nerve firing so

1755
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,480
we have

1756
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,219
um

1757
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:56,818
THC for one it fires uh off at a certain

1758
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:59,460
height well you add another cannabinoid

1759
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:00,779
like CBG and that height actually goes

1760
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:03,980
even higher

1761
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:07,080
well you put CBD in that in that same

1762
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:10,019
two molecules might go lower

1763
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:12,238
but it might extend the duration of it

1764
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:15,120
so it lasts longer so you have the same

1765
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:18,838
effect but longer or you have the same

1766
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:23,099
effect but not as high but longer or

1767
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:24,479
shorter so these things that add to

1768
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,719
these cannabinoids these different

1769
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:30,778
components either can make the high more

1770
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:33,420
potent or less potent or make it longer

1771
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:36,120
duration or shorter duration it could

1772
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:40,440
also cause effects that give you like a

1773
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:43,979
soaring effect or a heightened color

1774
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:46,798
effect or you know Sensation that is

1775
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:48,439
more associated with the hearing you

1776
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:52,039
know affects your hearing

1777
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:56,779
so the cannabinoids

1778
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:59,579
affect the nerves by either directly

1779
01:09:56,779 --> 01:10:01,139
attaching themselves and

1780
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:03,600
um you know

1781
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:06,300
making it more potent stronger duration

1782
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,219
lower duration higher duration

1783
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,079
um yeah it it it's all these different

1784
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:13,260
effects that need to be cataloged and

1785
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:16,260
what they the uses in and they do

1786
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:18,780
um so

1787
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,480
as far as the effects of like Indica

1788
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:23,039
sativa a lot of the the basic

1789
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:25,678
information is

1790
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:29,039
um you can have a Colombian gold or you

1791
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:33,359
have like Acapulco Gold uh these don't

1792
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:35,158
have a CBD in them they have THC a lot

1793
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:37,019
sometimes thcv if they're from like

1794
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:39,179
Thailand or South Africa

1795
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:43,679
um some from Colombia

1796
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:46,079
um or they have CBG CBC but there's no

1797
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,779
CBD or if there is it's super small

1798
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:51,719
amount though you can have something

1799
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:55,259
like uh Panama Red or Colombian Punta

1800
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:57,840
Rojo that has CBD but is also considered

1801
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:59,400
like a sativa so you get these narcotic

1802
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,779
effects mixed with the high sativa

1803
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:02,579
effects

1804
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:05,639
um but in a different way than say a

1805
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:09,420
hash plant that has more of a narcotic

1806
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:11,100
effect so more CBN so high CBD and high

1807
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:14,100
CBN

1808
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:16,620
um tend to give you the narcotic effects

1809
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,480
um lacking CBD with these other

1810
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:22,859
cannabinoids give you the what people

1811
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:25,079
you know feel as a sativa effect

1812
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:26,880
yeah brilliant stuff there I'm gonna

1813
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:29,698
have to go really listen to that myself

1814
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,579
and I'm sure the listeners will as well

1815
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:35,399
in terms of a sort of slightly adjacent

1816
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:36,899
topic I've spoken to DJ Short and many

1817
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:39,719
others about this but I'd be interested

1818
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:42,119
to hear your take on what causes modern

1819
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:44,219
strains to have a ceiling you know you

1820
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:46,140
can only get so high and if you keep

1821
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:47,880
smoking you sort of don't go anywhere

1822
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:50,159
else but with a lot of the land races

1823
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:52,199
particularly the sativas you can sort of

1824
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,299
just keep going and going what what do

1825
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:58,079
you think causes that ceiling

1826
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:01,260
well the ceiling CBD typically so CBD

1827
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:03,719
can be used if say you're freaking out

1828
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:06,480
or your friend's freaking out and or

1829
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:09,859
you've taken Edibles and you're just too

1830
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:12,899
high uh taking doses of CBD will

1831
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:14,339
modulate the the high effect so then

1832
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:18,719
comfortableness that you get from too

1833
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:21,119
much THC can be brought down with higher

1834
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:23,579
amounts of CBD so it'll bind to the THC

1835
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:25,380
and kind of get you out of that

1836
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:27,119
um you know at least bring it down to a

1837
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:31,020
more comfortable state so higher muscle

1838
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:32,579
CBD will kind of help with that for the

1839
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,500
ceiling this highs that seem to Take You

1840
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:38,399
Higher and Higher those strains seem to

1841
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:41,100
have no CBD or very little CBD also

1842
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,599
there's also you know cannabinoids that

1843
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:48,140
are in higher amounts like CBG

1844
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:51,659
CBG varieties with THC seem to

1845
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:54,960
potentiate make the THC more potent

1846
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:58,500
so um you know higher amounts of CBG

1847
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,939
with the THC along with thcv and you get

1848
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,060
even more expressions like Malawi

1849
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:06,238
varieties have the thcv so you get more

1850
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:08,400
of this rushing waves of euphoria and

1851
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:09,899
seems like there's no ceiling as you

1852
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:12,658
smoke more

1853
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:14,519
um basically you smoke a little bit and

1854
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:17,099
you can't physically smoke too much

1855
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,440
because you're just so High

1856
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:21,360
um because you keep going higher and

1857
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:23,158
higher but if you had CBD in that you

1858
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:25,738
could kind of counteract the

1859
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:29,099
uncomfortableness of the high THC in

1860
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:31,379
your body and it'll bring you down

1861
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:34,199
if that makes any sense

1862
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:35,940
yeah certainly so I guess I'm wondering

1863
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:38,279
then do you think that we like you know

1864
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:40,500
a lot of these modern strains have some

1865
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:42,840
amount of CBD in them that sort of

1866
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:45,719
unknowingly is limiting us

1867
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:48,119
absolutely yeah most of what people are

1868
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,079
smoking has CBD and some concentration

1869
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:52,619
or

1870
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:54,359
um you know that's that's mainly what is

1871
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:57,059
in a lot of these is this it's a

1872
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:58,319
multi-poly hybrid with CBD and almost

1873
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:01,679
all

1874
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,899
yeah great some good food for thought so

1875
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,880
let's go back to one of the questions we

1876
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:09,920
normally start the interview off with

1877
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,920
what are you being smoking on recently

1878
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,699
um chocolate Thai

1879
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,159
um some Mexican varieties like Michoacan

1880
01:14:14,698 --> 01:14:21,479
Verde Limon

1881
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:22,979
um my uh devil skunk

1882
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:26,819
um Devil's tit

1883
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:29,099
which is uh Durban Poison alcohol c99

1884
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:31,099
that's a wonderful strain super potent

1885
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:35,060
wonderful taste

1886
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:37,679
and it can be absolutely too potent

1887
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:39,539
concentrates will freak you out I

1888
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,920
remember taking uh two hits at the

1889
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:43,319
emerald cup and I was in a fetal

1890
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:47,219
position for several hours uh just

1891
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:49,619
hoping for uh for myself to come down it

1892
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:51,239
was uh yeah it was very uncomfortable

1893
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:53,119
for quite a while but that was from

1894
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:55,619
concentrates made from the devil's tit

1895
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,619
which I tried to get

1896
01:14:55,619 --> 01:15:01,198
um judged that year but all my samples

1897
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:03,119
for some reason never got judged so that

1898
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:05,119
was the last time any samples in the

1899
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:08,460
emerald cup

1900
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:10,380
ah very interesting to hear that and uh

1901
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,480
I love the idea being in the federal

1902
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:14,699
position it's so potent it sounds up my

1903
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,698
alley I noticed online that the devil's

1904
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:19,379
tit as well as the purple Pantera some

1905
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:22,619
of the more popular lines that popped up

1906
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:24,179
a lot on the various forums what was

1907
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:26,399
interesting to me was that you know

1908
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:28,739
given the diversity of the genetics you

1909
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,179
work with do you ever feel like you can

1910
01:15:28,738 --> 01:15:31,979
predict the winners or what's going to

1911
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:33,840
be the fan favorite or is it really just

1912
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:37,439
a bit up in the air

1913
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:40,560
you know it all depends like um

1914
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,359
we the one year we entered in the purple

1915
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,179
pineapple bond which is pineapple Thai

1916
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:47,339
and grape Crush it tastes good it tastes

1917
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:49,619
wonderful it's got a great high and

1918
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:51,000
people love it but the thing is it

1919
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:53,158
wasn't our most potent it wasn't the

1920
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,198
thing we're most proud of so sometimes

1921
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:57,779
it just depends sometimes if something

1922
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:58,879
is familiar to people but different

1923
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:02,399
enough

1924
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:05,100
uh to go hey well this is this is

1925
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:07,379
actually quite good those usually seem

1926
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:09,239
to be the ones that people gravitate to

1927
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,800
so it's got to be something familiar you

1928
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:12,238
know it has that modern profile it has

1929
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,659
the colors and looks that people want

1930
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:18,419
that smell you know and then amazing

1931
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:22,019
High to go along with it so it's not

1932
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:24,300
always the most potent the most unique

1933
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,860
um the best in my eyes but you know

1934
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:27,980
people dislike something that's familiar

1935
01:16:25,859 --> 01:16:31,859
as well

1936
01:16:27,979 --> 01:16:34,198
yeah sure sure I mean on the other end

1937
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:36,599
of the spectrum so to speak I noticed

1938
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:39,479
that the railgun seems like such a super

1939
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:42,780
fun mix of like genetics like a sativa

1940
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:45,178
Lover's party and along with that came

1941
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:47,939
quite a hefty 100 plus Day flower time

1942
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:50,219
it got me wondering do these sort of

1943
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:52,079
strains ever get out there that much or

1944
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:54,260
is it really quite difficult to find

1945
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:56,880
people willing to run it

1946
01:16:54,260 --> 01:17:00,480
actually some of these strings

1947
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,640
um were created in like testing rounds

1948
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,859
where I was growing for different

1949
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,480
varieties and then we grow them out and

1950
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:07,859
um you know I initially I didn't make a

1951
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:09,599
lot of seed because

1952
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:10,979
you know we're testing out these

1953
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,679
varieties

1954
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:15,479
um so what people get out out there is

1955
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,520
not too much there's a there's just not

1956
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:19,198
a lot available because

1957
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,840
um of the breeding practices because a

1958
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:23,460
lot of preservation was being done

1959
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,860
um which takes a lot of time you know

1960
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:28,500
you're spending a year and a half on one

1961
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:30,179
strain trying to do selections and

1962
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:32,399
preserve it

1963
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:34,440
um you don't get a lot of time to create

1964
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,899
other varieties

1965
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:38,698
um so you know

1966
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:40,859
um there's some of these strains there's

1967
01:17:38,698 --> 01:17:43,019
just not a lot available for people to

1968
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:44,698
grow so I'm trying to work out the stuff

1969
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:48,360
that's more popular I'm trying to go

1970
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:50,339
back to those and do larger selections

1971
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:51,719
um you know for people so they can get

1972
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,699
exposed to these varieties which are

1973
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:55,319
quite good like the devil's tit the

1974
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:58,678
dragon's fire the West Coast Purple

1975
01:17:55,319 --> 01:18:00,479
Diesel blueberry blast this you know try

1976
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:02,940
to make stuff available to people that

1977
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:05,039
this is wonderful and there's a lot of

1978
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:07,019
varieties that I've made that just knock

1979
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:08,819
people's socks off but I just need to go

1980
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,620
back and you know make more of it

1981
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:13,079
available to people

1982
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:15,000
yeah God I can only imagine you've got

1983
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:16,019
such a catalog of work it's really cool

1984
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,179
to see

1985
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,620
out of curiosity I I look I'm going to

1986
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:21,000
be a stickler here I'm really keen on

1987
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:22,439
the rail gun can you tell me what it's

1988
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,800
like

1989
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:27,238
uh railgun is trippy uh very

1990
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,239
um

1991
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:32,519
God it's uh very Thai dominant it's got

1992
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:35,639
the zamol in it which has got you know

1993
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,280
like South Indian flavors and highs um

1994
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,880
it's very psychedelic

1995
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:41,039
um

1996
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,500
can be noid inducing where you can kind

1997
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:46,140
of get panic attacks but it's also it's

1998
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:48,658
very very euphoric and very desirable

1999
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,460
it's a it's kind of like walking the

2000
01:18:48,658 --> 01:18:52,920
edge of being super uncomfortable but

2001
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:56,158
really high in really flying high and

2002
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:59,039
being in a a like a roller coaster dream

2003
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:01,079
it's it's really good but um it's kind

2004
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:03,658
of hard to deal with but um

2005
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:05,519
yeah it's it's it's really tasty and the

2006
01:19:03,658 --> 01:19:06,779
flowers are actually pretty

2007
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,060
um dense

2008
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:11,399
um due to the Angola red pie purple Thai

2009
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:14,219
uh male it kind of gives you nice good

2010
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:16,559
flowers that yield well but also

2011
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:17,899
retaining a lot of this long flowering

2012
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,360
um

2013
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:24,299
hides from these small lines

2014
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:25,920
yeah nice and did you ever try the zamal

2015
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,320
and it's pure form it's it's got a bit

2016
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,158
of a cult following to it that's for

2017
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:33,059
sure

2018
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:35,519
there's there's quite a few uh three to

2019
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:38,300
five different samal varieties

2020
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:43,020
um they're all kind of uh you know Malay

2021
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:46,679
uh Thai in in like Indonesian Indian

2022
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:48,120
South Indian derived but it's a French

2023
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:49,800
island so there there's a lot of

2024
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:51,899
variability depending on what part of

2025
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,940
the island it's from but yeah the the

2026
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:55,979
zamal by itself is really trippy it's

2027
01:19:53,939 --> 01:19:59,698
hard to grow seeds are hard to germinate

2028
01:19:55,979 --> 01:20:02,819
uh for some reason they seem to um lose

2029
01:19:59,698 --> 01:20:04,198
viability quite quick quite quickly so

2030
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:07,439
it's hard to keep around so you gotta

2031
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:09,479
renew and refresh the stock quite often

2032
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:11,460
oh wow that's an interesting trait you

2033
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:13,198
really don't hear about very much

2034
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:14,880
well some some varieties will last

2035
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,039
longer I think it's due to the seed

2036
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,119
coats some of them are more dense and

2037
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:18,779
seem to

2038
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:22,859
um

2039
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:26,819
you know allow the seed to last longer

2040
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:30,960
but other ones will be more shallow less

2041
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:32,819
um you know density to it smaller and

2042
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,319
they just seemed like they they dry out

2043
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:36,960
quicker or they just are more

2044
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:39,719
susceptible to heat and they just lose

2045
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,840
viability a lot faster than others you

2046
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:44,399
got me curious now tupada how do you

2047
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,020
store your seeds and how do you

2048
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:49,500
germinate them

2049
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:51,420
for storage for what people get uh it's

2050
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,779
a cool dry place that's what people are

2051
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:55,440
flying if you store in a refrigerator

2052
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:56,880
whenever you take it out of the

2053
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:58,259
refrigerator you need to germinate those

2054
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,020
right away

2055
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,480
um if you don't the moisture that seems

2056
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,940
to come from the refrigerator

2057
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:08,698
um will actually make them unviable

2058
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:10,559
quite quickly so if you refrigerate

2059
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:13,500
anything you can keep them in there for

2060
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,539
quite a while you want to try to not use

2061
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,939
desiccants because desiccants

2062
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:20,340
um will work for a while but after a

2063
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:22,379
period of time they will go bad and

2064
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:25,199
actually pull more moisture into where

2065
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:28,140
those seeds are being kept fouling the

2066
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:29,579
seeds but if you use a refrigerator once

2067
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,560
you remove from the refrigerator you

2068
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:33,658
want to put them right back as soon as

2069
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,179
possible but if they're out with you

2070
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:37,738
know for more than an hour or so then

2071
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:39,899
you would want to germinate them as soon

2072
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:42,658
as possible because they'll lose

2073
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:45,779
viability quite quickly there's also

2074
01:21:42,658 --> 01:21:47,339
long-term storage for like uh varieties

2075
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:49,019
that you want to keep for a long period

2076
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:51,719
of time you have to freeze them and they

2077
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:54,420
need to be wrapped within you know glass

2078
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:57,000
vials within rice within coffee

2079
01:21:54,420 --> 01:22:01,140
containers and then Frozen and you want

2080
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,880
to make sure those are thought out but

2081
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,820
don't retain moisture as you're throwing

2082
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,940
them out because that moisture will

2083
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:10,559
cause issues with the seeds

2084
01:22:07,939 --> 01:22:14,279
but the majority of what people get is

2085
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,320
from a cool dry place a germination now

2086
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:18,800
I'm I am recommending what's called

2087
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:21,179
chemical scarification

2088
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,960
basically you use hydrogen peroxide

2089
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:26,880
three percent with water 50 50. so most

2090
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,020
of the stuff you buy at the stores at

2091
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,060
least in the United States three percent

2092
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:33,840
hydrogen peroxide

2093
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:36,260
he makes it 50 50 50 with tap water tap

2094
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,760
water in the United States has some

2095
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:40,980
bleaching agents which is good because

2096
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,900
it's a disinfectant the hydrogen

2097
01:22:40,979 --> 01:22:45,059
peroxide is a disinfectant so you could

2098
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:46,439
also use you know bottled water or

2099
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,880
whatever you want to use water but the

2100
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:49,859
idea is you want something that'll

2101
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,739
disinfect the hydrogen peroxide will

2102
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:54,658
help soften the shells of the seeds

2103
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:56,759
causing what they call scarification so

2104
01:22:54,658 --> 01:22:58,019
it softens it and also disinfects it

2105
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,640
because

2106
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,679
um the sources that people are getting

2107
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:04,199
these seeds from especially if they're

2108
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,579
from outside their country if they're

2109
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:07,678
from outside the country I would

2110
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:09,899
recommend freezing whatever seeds you

2111
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,819
get at least overnight and then

2112
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,219
defrosting them and make sure they they

2113
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:16,019
dry out within without any moisture if

2114
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:19,619
you freeze the seeds you're killing the

2115
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:22,739
eggs The larva in any live adults

2116
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:25,500
um that may be coming along for the ride

2117
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:27,899
with your seeds a lot of people don't

2118
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,219
realize that a lot of the Critters and

2119
01:23:27,899 --> 01:23:30,899
stuff that they're getting are from

2120
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:32,819
seeds they're getting from outside the

2121
01:23:30,899 --> 01:23:36,299
country and these can destroy your

2122
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:38,579
plants they could uh you know uh eat up

2123
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:41,400
all your seeds in within a period of

2124
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:43,500
time you'll find little webbing inside

2125
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:45,479
the seeds and they'll be eaten from the

2126
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:48,238
inside out as they you know devour your

2127
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:49,678
Priceless seeds so freezing it is a good

2128
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:50,879
way of killing them and then you can

2129
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,760
store them for whatever period of time

2130
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,739
you want germination once you've done

2131
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,440
the chemical scarification you want to

2132
01:23:55,738 --> 01:23:59,759
wash with tap water or bottled water you

2133
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:02,039
know running water is usually best and

2134
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:05,640
then you dry them off I recommend using

2135
01:24:02,039 --> 01:24:07,859
a paper towel with tap water and then

2136
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:10,619
checking on the seeds with a moist paper

2137
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:12,960
towel wrapped and folded and then placed

2138
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:15,119
inside a sealed baggie and you place

2139
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,698
that in a cool dry place or with a

2140
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:19,079
heating mat and you check on the seeds

2141
01:24:17,698 --> 01:24:21,059
maybe every eight hours until

2142
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:23,158
germination

2143
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:25,140
now you want to make sure that you wash

2144
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:27,119
your hands with soap and water don't

2145
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,520
touch your face or your body because

2146
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:30,658
there's bacteria there's different

2147
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,460
um

2148
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:35,519
um

2149
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:37,439
funguses that could be incorporated from

2150
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,300
your body and then you can contaminate

2151
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,839
your seeds so they'll mold

2152
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,060
um

2153
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,520
and if you use a heating mat I recommend

2154
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:47,640
only using it for maybe 24 hours to 48

2155
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,560
hours that's it because the heat and

2156
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:53,579
moisture will cause mold over a period

2157
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:56,340
of time so heat will help push along the

2158
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:58,738
germination process it helps

2159
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:00,179
um but I would quit using that after a

2160
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:04,019
couple days there's also some heating

2161
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:04,679
mats that you can adjust and use a lower

2162
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,500
um

2163
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:09,119
heat setting and if you have one they

2164
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:11,219
can has adjustable setting then you

2165
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,479
could use lower heat and use it for a

2166
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:14,579
longer period of time but if you have a

2167
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:17,339
heating mat that you just plug in and

2168
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:19,500
you have no ability to adjust the heat

2169
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:21,539
then I would use it for more than 24 to

2170
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,520
48 hours tops

2171
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:26,579
um but checking on it every four eight

2172
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,800
hours of your seat until they germinate

2173
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:30,719
um up to three days so after three days

2174
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,000
I recommend

2175
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:36,539
um using a fingernail or

2176
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:39,420
um maybe something uh to open up the

2177
01:25:36,539 --> 01:25:41,340
seed cases and then removing the film

2178
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,140
that's around the embryo of the seed and

2179
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:45,500
then sowing the seeds in a sterilized

2180
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:48,900
soil starter soil

2181
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:51,238
I use a soilless medium or a medium

2182
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:54,179
that's been sterilized

2183
01:25:51,238 --> 01:25:56,579
um and sterilization is um I recommend

2184
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:58,679
something for strutting seeds because uh

2185
01:25:56,579 --> 01:26:01,198
what's called damp off

2186
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:03,600
um these seeds or seedlings

2187
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,979
um are uh or have built resistance yet

2188
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,260
to

2189
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:10,138
um fungus and bacteria that are in the

2190
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,480
soil that is great for you know growing

2191
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:14,699
plants but if these plants haven't built

2192
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,619
the resistance to them yet they will um

2193
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:18,299
they will cause damp off and they'll die

2194
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:19,500
so a lot of people are killing their

2195
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,719
seeds and don't realize it because

2196
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,639
they're using recycled soil or they're

2197
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:26,639
using bag soil that's been opened you

2198
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:28,980
know several times which has created a

2199
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,719
you know fungal development which isn't

2200
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:31,859
great for these seedlings and Seed

2201
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,439
embryos

2202
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:37,439
an easy way of sterilizing your soil is

2203
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:40,039
taking your medium and placing it in the

2204
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:44,039
turkey bag or oven bag and then

2205
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:46,979
moistening the the soil not so it's

2206
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:48,840
soaking wet but so it's moist

2207
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:51,479
um and damp and then basically you put

2208
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,300
in a microwave for two minutes and you

2209
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:56,638
do this three to four times and then on

2210
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,560
the fourth time you do you seal the bag

2211
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:01,079
with the little zip tie that comes along

2212
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:05,039
with it the moisture that's in the bag

2213
01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:07,559
will Steam and sterilize the soil and

2214
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:10,079
that last zap of the microwave is uh

2215
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,300
three to four minutes you gotta kind of

2216
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:13,500
estimated or guesstimate it due to the

2217
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,840
strengths of the microwaves but that

2218
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:18,300
steam will help kill any of the harmful

2219
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,219
pathogens in the soil the good stuff

2220
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,779
will come back within a minute or two so

2221
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:23,579
you're not destroying

2222
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:24,658
um what's in the soil for a long period

2223
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:26,939
of time you're just securing the bad

2224
01:27:24,658 --> 01:27:27,899
stuff and that's what you want to use

2225
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:31,138
for

2226
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:33,719
um you know seed starting or for a

2227
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:35,520
Seedling transplants or planting plants

2228
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:37,739
in general because you know there's

2229
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,400
nothing bad in it at the time

2230
01:27:37,738 --> 01:27:40,379
um

2231
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:43,198
and then um

2232
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,840
you sow the seeds basically I like to

2233
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:47,638
use a natural light to begin with and

2234
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:51,679
then once they've come above the ground

2235
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:55,020
then I use T5 fluorescence and basically

2236
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:57,960
veg them until you're ready to

2237
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:00,360
transplant them to beer cups and then

2238
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,939
you veg them with um you know whatever

2239
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:05,219
light regimen that you want to use the

2240
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:07,439
light regiment that I that I use for

2241
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:10,560
vegging plants is um

2242
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:16,019
uh 13 hours of light in a 24-hour period

2243
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:17,940
And I use 12 hours from uh say 7 A.M to

2244
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:20,340
7 P.M that's 12 hours straight and then

2245
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:23,819
in the middle of the dark period

2246
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:27,000
um so five and a half hours uh after the

2247
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:30,420
lights have uh gone off so you have 12

2248
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,219
hours of lights on so say 7 A.M to 7 p.m

2249
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,899
and then five and a half hours of

2250
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:35,639
Darkness the lights will come out for

2251
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:37,799
one hour so basically like in the middle

2252
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:40,020
of the night the lights come on

2253
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,760
um and then after that hour of light the

2254
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,260
lights go back off for another five and

2255
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,159
a half hours and then the cycle is

2256
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,980
repeated

2257
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:48,119
so basically the hour of light in the

2258
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:50,039
middle of the dark period tricks the

2259
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:53,158
plants in thinking that the days are

2260
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:57,960
longer a longer days will keep plants in

2261
01:28:53,158 --> 01:29:02,359
veg and this is a good way of saving on

2262
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:04,679
electric bills and it is a good way of

2263
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:06,779
transitioning when you go to flower the

2264
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:09,119
plants there's not much of a change from

2265
01:29:06,779 --> 01:29:10,979
Veg to flour

2266
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:13,139
um for flowering plants and sexing

2267
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:15,359
plants I basically use 10 and a half

2268
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:17,639
hours of light and uh 13 and a half

2269
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,619
hours of Darkness the dark period is

2270
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:22,319
actually what triggers flowering not the

2271
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:24,859
light so the 10 half hours is kind of

2272
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:27,238
the right ratio that you need for

2273
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:29,339
extreme flowering ancient sex most

2274
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:31,979
plants within three to four days the

2275
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:34,500
more extreme would be seven to ten days

2276
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:37,319
but most flour most things you can sex

2277
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,880
within uh three to four days no problem

2278
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:41,880
that's

2279
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:44,460
what I use for germination

2280
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,619
that's incredible what very detailed

2281
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:49,079
answer I guess for me the natural

2282
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:50,698
progression is tell me how you grow how

2283
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,559
do you do it are you organic you're a

2284
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:53,579
soil guy are you cocoa what's the

2285
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,800
rundown

2286
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:58,500
I'm an organic guy so I like using

2287
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,239
organic methods Sun grown is my my

2288
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,399
preferred method but I like to do my

2289
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,799
selections indoors

2290
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,059
um to speed along things

2291
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,039
um so

2292
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:09,659
you know I sex plants basically after

2293
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:13,920
the first

2294
01:30:09,658 --> 01:30:16,439
um true leaves I actually use what they

2295
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,899
call the Femme technique which allows

2296
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:22,859
you to do a topping of the main stem and

2297
01:30:18,899 --> 01:30:24,719
leaving two-thirds left over and from

2298
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:27,479
that you're able to create not only just

2299
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:29,399
from topping like uh two different

2300
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:31,678
branches but sometimes three to four the

2301
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:33,599
optimal is four different main branches

2302
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,739
from that one pinching and when you

2303
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,179
pinch

2304
01:30:34,738 --> 01:30:41,939
um the apical buds the main stem of your

2305
01:30:39,179 --> 01:30:45,480
um your plant it causes what are called

2306
01:30:41,939 --> 01:30:47,759
auxins to go from the the top of the

2307
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:49,459
plant down to the roots and will cause

2308
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,020
the roots to grow more

2309
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:53,698
this needs to be repeated basically

2310
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:55,920
every four to five days or three to four

2311
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:58,439
days depending on the the growth rate of

2312
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,779
the plant and every time you do this

2313
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:02,399
you're creating more main branches and

2314
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:04,380
you're also creating more Roots so it's

2315
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,599
going back and forth so I do this in veg

2316
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:10,619
as I'm waiting for the plants to get to

2317
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:13,079
the right size so from seed for like

2318
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:15,840
indicas and multiplying hybrids from

2319
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:18,840
seed to flour I like to veg the plants

2320
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:22,139
from 30 to 60 days for like indicas and

2321
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:24,779
hybrids for a longer flowering Tropicals

2322
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:27,920
in equatorials I like to veg the plants

2323
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:31,859
from 60 to 90 days from seed

2324
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:35,100
nice nice and what's your thoughts on

2325
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:37,859
selection of males do you like to do it

2326
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,960
based on that initial when you're sexing

2327
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:41,279
them or do you wait longer how do you

2328
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,819
select males

2329
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:46,500
well I do certain things what I look for

2330
01:31:44,819 --> 01:31:48,539
is under natural light when you're

2331
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:51,060
sprouting plants

2332
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:52,859
um under natural light there is like a

2333
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:55,260
day or two which

2334
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:58,139
um the sprout will flash certain traits

2335
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:01,860
like colors like you can see a flash of

2336
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:03,739
red or purple in the Sprouts

2337
01:32:01,859 --> 01:32:06,299
um when they first come up above ground

2338
01:32:03,738 --> 01:32:09,658
just for a day or two and that's kind of

2339
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:11,279
indication what they'll do in flower so

2340
01:32:09,658 --> 01:32:13,679
you can actually do your selections for

2341
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,300
colors that way picking out the special

2342
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,980
plants

2343
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,000
um early on so you have to waste your

2344
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:20,339
time growing out of these different

2345
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,560
plants to get those special plants

2346
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,659
um but you you basically indicate like

2347
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,880
this one had red red traits it's going

2348
01:32:24,658 --> 01:32:29,039
to have purple traits and then as you're

2349
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,119
vegging it you kind of

2350
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:33,179
um

2351
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:35,639
see that when you maturely flour them

2352
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:37,199
out you can see the the how as a little

2353
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:39,239
Sprout this told you that this is going

2354
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:41,219
to be a super colorful plant and it will

2355
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:42,658
have these special traits

2356
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:45,480
um for

2357
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:47,460
uh selecting males and females

2358
01:32:45,479 --> 01:32:48,959
um there's three types of DNA that's

2359
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:51,539
used in cannabis

2360
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,460
uh there's like the cellular DNA which

2361
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:56,219
is like the structures

2362
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,658
um that's what you see uh outwardly you

2363
01:32:56,219 --> 01:33:00,060
know the the structure of the plant

2364
01:32:57,658 --> 01:33:01,559
that's kind of like um the female side

2365
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:03,420
so females you want to see the structure

2366
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,420
you want to make sure that they have

2367
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:08,340
good branching lots of branching because

2368
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:11,039
if they're not branchy there's kind of

2369
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:12,539
hempy so if there's no not a lot of

2370
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:15,300
branching it's more of a hemp plant you

2371
01:33:12,539 --> 01:33:18,179
know it's kind of all stem so you want

2372
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:19,739
super branchy plants for your females

2373
01:33:18,179 --> 01:33:21,060
and then also you want to look at the

2374
01:33:19,738 --> 01:33:23,638
roots

2375
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:25,139
um you want to pull off the pots I do a

2376
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:27,659
lot of repotting so I get to examine the

2377
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:29,400
roots but you want plants that produce

2378
01:33:27,658 --> 01:33:31,738
good root zones you don't want a little

2379
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:33,899
teeny carrot I don't want to go through

2380
01:33:31,738 --> 01:33:36,238
growing a plant for nine months and then

2381
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:39,179
seeing that it has a small little carrot

2382
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:41,579
of a root and this is why your plant you

2383
01:33:39,179 --> 01:33:43,020
know sucked so when you're breathing and

2384
01:33:41,579 --> 01:33:44,399
you're selecting for these plants you

2385
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:47,159
kind of look at the root Zone make sure

2386
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:48,658
they're prolific either growing sideways

2387
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:51,539
or downward or they're good roots

2388
01:33:48,658 --> 01:33:53,819
because says if you got 20 or 50 plants

2389
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:56,158
you're you know selecting from

2390
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:57,299
um and there's no real real way of like

2391
01:33:56,158 --> 01:33:59,460
telling the difference between the

2392
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:01,920
plants from like the top up but the

2393
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:05,279
roots will tell you which ones will grow

2394
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:08,520
better because that is kind of like the

2395
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:11,579
um mitochondrial DNA the ability for it

2396
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:14,460
to uptake nutrients and then convert

2397
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:17,519
that in the sugars into energy ATP same

2398
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:20,039
as humans humans take sugars from the

2399
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,440
mitochondria and they'll switch the

2400
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:25,679
sugars into ATP adenosine triphosphate

2401
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:27,779
which is energy plants do the same thing

2402
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:30,239
um so cannabis has this mitochondrial

2403
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:32,219
DNA and that is something that you can

2404
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:35,579
see through the the way it converts

2405
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:38,219
sugars and creates stem and you know

2406
01:34:35,579 --> 01:34:40,460
growth of the plants the other thing to

2407
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:43,859
look for is

2408
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:46,679
the chloroplast DNA what creates the the

2409
01:34:43,859 --> 01:34:47,539
terpens the cannabinoids

2410
01:34:46,679 --> 01:34:49,980
um

2411
01:34:47,539 --> 01:34:53,880
the um

2412
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:56,698
uh the plants that create uh the uh

2413
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:59,400
current uh keratinoids those like the

2414
01:34:56,698 --> 01:35:01,439
colors and the plants uh so that's when

2415
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:03,359
I look for colorful plants that have

2416
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:05,099
like Reds and purples because they have

2417
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:07,979
these flavonoids and different things

2418
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:10,079
that impart certain turpins and

2419
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:12,479
cannabinoids

2420
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:14,100
um that make certain plants special not

2421
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:15,779
only for flavors and tastes but the

2422
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:20,100
highs along the social along with that

2423
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:22,259
so stems I rub them uh using like a

2424
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:24,600
piece of paper or something other than

2425
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:25,980
your fingers because you smell one plant

2426
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,600
and they smell another plant they kind

2427
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:29,698
of mix together but if you use a piece

2428
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,920
of paper you can kind of smell the aroma

2429
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:33,539
of that plant and if it's pungent or

2430
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,980
stringent or if it affects nasal

2431
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:37,738
passageways it affects certain different

2432
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:39,238
ways because of those long chain Turpin

2433
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:40,678
profiles that I was telling I was

2434
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:42,979
talking about before those long chain

2435
01:35:40,679 --> 01:35:45,719
turpins are something that are kind of

2436
01:35:42,979 --> 01:35:47,939
unknown but your body kind of recognizes

2437
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:50,399
so if you have this certain experience

2438
01:35:47,939 --> 01:35:52,379
by smelling the aroma of that plant and

2439
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:54,479
that one's special so you kind of

2440
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:57,420
Mark that this one's got the special

2441
01:35:54,479 --> 01:36:00,059
Aroma it's got a resin profile it's got

2442
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:02,100
good roots it's branchy

2443
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:05,460
um that's something that is good to

2444
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:08,159
select for for males I kind of

2445
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:10,319
do the same I look for the large root

2446
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:12,779
zones uh the branch she wants and the

2447
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:14,460
ones that have different uh color

2448
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:17,579
content so if you've got a bunch of

2449
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:19,859
males and some of them have you know pay

2450
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:21,179
deals that have purple in them

2451
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:23,219
um but there's nothing else the rest of

2452
01:36:21,179 --> 01:36:25,460
the plant is green another one has

2453
01:36:23,219 --> 01:36:28,619
purple patials but it has purple stems

2454
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:30,960
and uh the sequels are purple then that

2455
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:33,119
one's got a higher quantity of color to

2456
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,600
it so that one might be chosen over one

2457
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:38,279
that has just green effects because you

2458
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,480
know there's nothing really you can you

2459
01:36:38,279 --> 01:36:43,800
know pick from it other than the colors

2460
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:46,799
so those are just a few things that I

2461
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:51,060
use for the selection criteria as well

2462
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:53,820
as resin content there's also the type

2463
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:55,460
of trichomes on males so if you have a

2464
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:58,979
male that has

2465
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:01,198
trichome production on the sepals of the

2466
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:02,759
the male flowers

2467
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:05,579
um I call them flowers but they're the

2468
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:08,280
the male projections uh that you know

2469
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:10,079
drop the pollen if you see resin on them

2470
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:11,340
then that's also a good trade especially

2471
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:13,439
if they have different colors on the

2472
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:17,819
resins like the

2473
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:21,000
um Neville's Haze purple tie uh F3 male

2474
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:24,238
that I use for some of my lines it had

2475
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,340
purple resin trichomes on the males so

2476
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:29,039
that was kind of a added cool thing that

2477
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:31,079
I like to uh see in the males

2478
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,519
that's awesome to hear what a

2479
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:34,738
comprehensive rundown gosh I feel like

2480
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,000
that's becoming my uh go-to saying for

2481
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:37,439
this interview I'll have to come up with

2482
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,500
something better

2483
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:42,839
um but following on with that I wanted

2484
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:45,119
to ask just a few of the common things

2485
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,039
we hear nowadays about selection like if

2486
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:49,619
you agree with them the first one that

2487
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,600
comes to mind is DJ Short always loved

2488
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:54,960
to say that he wanted the more sativa of

2489
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:57,480
the two parents to be the mother so did

2490
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,739
you do you feel like there's any um sort

2491
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:00,500
of correlation with that have you ever

2492
01:37:58,738 --> 01:38:02,899
heard that one

2493
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:06,300
uh yeah my my

2494
01:38:02,899 --> 01:38:09,119
mine might be the I was reverse that so

2495
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:10,739
with me I think the females are what you

2496
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:12,179
see this so if you want to look a

2497
01:38:10,738 --> 01:38:15,599
certain way you want the female to be

2498
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:17,100
that impression but if you want um the

2499
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,239
potency and the qualities that comes

2500
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,560
from the male

2501
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,259
so

2502
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:25,139
for males I look for

2503
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:27,060
um the ones that are stinkiest have uh

2504
01:38:25,139 --> 01:38:29,639
the more branching

2505
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:32,460
um and the colors so colors branching

2506
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:34,679
and you know

2507
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:36,840
root development from the male is what I

2508
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:39,840
think Parts qualities and potency and

2509
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:42,360
then the female adds uh the looks and

2510
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,159
some of the smells to the line and

2511
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:46,079
that's kind of where I see I see potency

2512
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:49,979
and qualities coming from the males and

2513
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:52,559
structures uh and the the way to use

2514
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:55,799
those uh you know like the mitochondrial

2515
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:57,659
DNA from uh the females

2516
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,600
so chloroplast

2517
01:38:57,658 --> 01:39:02,779
some mitochondrial DNA and cellular DNA

2518
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,400
from the males mostly

2519
01:39:02,779 --> 01:39:07,679
mitochondrial and cellular DNA for the

2520
01:39:05,399 --> 01:39:09,779
females

2521
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,239
yeah that's brilliant I I think I

2522
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:14,639
actually uh sub cool said something

2523
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,619
along the same lines essentially so

2524
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,179
that's interesting to hear that that's a

2525
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:21,000
line there and he'd sort of noticed that

2526
01:39:18,179 --> 01:39:22,859
too I also forgot to mention that other

2527
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,600
question when you're talking about your

2528
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:26,579
light cycle you know shout out the Gas

2529
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:28,079
Lantern method you really don't hear

2530
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:29,880
about it too much these days but that's

2531
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:31,679
cool to hear you're rocking it

2532
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,960
I guess

2533
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:37,199
what's a modified Gas Lantern it's it's

2534
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,100
uh I use it for the the veg period

2535
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:40,678
um

2536
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:43,020
to fool the plants but the flowering

2537
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:45,899
cycle is something I've developed

2538
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:47,940
um and the way I've developed it is the

2539
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:50,339
reason I use 10 and a half uh 13 and a

2540
01:39:47,939 --> 01:39:54,059
half hours of darkness is that plants

2541
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:56,340
are growing in Hawaii or at the equator

2542
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:58,800
um aren't stimulated by

2543
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:00,000
um you know longer periods of dark

2544
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,340
periods so if you use too much dark

2545
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,579
period it doesn't actually cause the

2546
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:07,440
plants to grow any faster so I tried to

2547
01:40:05,579 --> 01:40:09,658
um think if I was a plant at the equator

2548
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:11,339
or Hawaii or other places on Earth what

2549
01:40:09,658 --> 01:40:13,738
would work in all these different places

2550
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:16,920
so the 13 and a half hours of Darkness

2551
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:18,658
Works in nature but it also works for

2552
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:21,560
all these plants to kind of give you the

2553
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:25,079
right ratio of light and darkness

2554
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:26,880
yeah I love it so if I just Loop you

2555
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:28,500
back to one of the other common breeding

2556
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,380
selection tips we hear what's your

2557
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:33,420
thoughts on the old stem rub

2558
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:35,460
stem rub is great and that gives you

2559
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:37,619
their Aromas and the stuff that you

2560
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:41,460
should be you know uh you know the more

2561
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:43,920
pungent or aromatic that the line is

2562
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:45,119
um if it if it basically makes you feel

2563
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:47,158
like a certain

2564
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:50,698
um way then that that is something

2565
01:40:47,158 --> 01:40:51,960
special and our our chemistry is evolved

2566
01:40:50,698 --> 01:40:53,819
with cannabis

2567
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:56,639
um I mean our endocannabinoid system is

2568
01:40:53,819 --> 01:40:59,158
evolved with cannabis so either it's

2569
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:01,319
evolved with us or we evolved with it

2570
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:04,439
um it's it's intrinsic to uh human

2571
01:41:01,319 --> 01:41:06,779
development so when you have an aroma

2572
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:08,399
that does something to you with certain

2573
01:41:06,779 --> 01:41:11,880
plants there's something specific in

2574
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:14,219
that uh chemical uh compound profile

2575
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:16,260
that is affecting you in whatever

2576
01:41:14,219 --> 01:41:18,119
special way is it you know that the

2577
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:19,800
primary turpins with the long chain

2578
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:22,079
terpen profile along with the

2579
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,420
cannabinoids that affecting you is it a

2580
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:26,340
a flavonoid with those turpins it's it's

2581
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:28,679
combination of the all the above it's

2582
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:31,199
the stuff that we need to do more

2583
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:32,639
studies on but they just haven't uh

2584
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:36,479
I haven't had the funding and the right

2585
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:38,579
people to yeah definitely

2586
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:41,279
I guess a question I wanted to ask you

2587
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:43,738
given like the amount of diversity there

2588
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:47,519
is within your clone Library when you

2589
01:41:43,738 --> 01:41:49,799
finally do go to make a new cross

2590
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:52,080
do you approach it as very conceptual

2591
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:54,960
like you sort of map out on paper or is

2592
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:57,000
it more of like uh let's mix and match

2593
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,859
and then sort of go from there based on

2594
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,779
what feels good how do you approach

2595
01:41:58,859 --> 01:42:03,960
breeding new crosses

2596
01:42:00,779 --> 01:42:05,759
well I there's a lot of work that goes

2597
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:08,100
in that no one ever sees so there's a

2598
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:10,260
lot of stuff written down of what would

2599
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:13,320
be great to work together so there's

2600
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:14,760
projects within projects so I'll I'll

2601
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:16,799
attempt to

2602
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:18,840
um grow out a bunch of varieties that I

2603
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,119
am working for a certain project well

2604
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:22,800
that project may go ahead because I've

2605
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:25,799
gotten the males and females that I want

2606
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:28,199
with the you know the varieties that I

2607
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:30,539
need to create that project well another

2608
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:31,859
project may be delayed because I'm not

2609
01:42:30,539 --> 01:42:33,300
getting the plants that I need for that

2610
01:42:31,859 --> 01:42:35,339
project so a lot of it's written down

2611
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:36,719
everything's mapped all the seeds are

2612
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:38,699
grown

2613
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,359
um the quantities

2614
01:42:38,698 --> 01:42:42,359
um

2615
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:45,000
uh it's it's all written down I have map

2616
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:46,799
after map of a seed trays of all these

2617
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,380
different varieties and growing out

2618
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,699
these varieties for certain projects

2619
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:52,920
um a lot of them don't get to fruition

2620
01:42:50,698 --> 01:42:53,939
and then as you're growing them you know

2621
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,760
[ __ ] happens

2622
01:42:53,939 --> 01:42:58,259
um plants die there's dampa there's

2623
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,539
birds that might destroy them there

2624
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:03,179
might be you know a child that goes in

2625
01:43:00,539 --> 01:43:04,679
and pulls up plants I've you name it

2626
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:06,239
things have happened

2627
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:08,340
um you know a light falls down to the

2628
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:10,459
plants killing those plants you know you

2629
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:12,960
can't help life

2630
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:14,880
so you can't always plan for everything

2631
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,819
so um

2632
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,079
a lot of these happen because you're

2633
01:43:17,819 --> 01:43:22,019
just trying to make the best thing

2634
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:23,340
possible with what you have a lot of

2635
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:26,040
times there are attempts at preservation

2636
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:27,900
and if you can't uh do preservation

2637
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:30,658
there's conservation and then if

2638
01:43:27,899 --> 01:43:32,698
conservation is not possible meaning you

2639
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:35,939
have only like two plants and you're

2640
01:43:32,698 --> 01:43:37,439
just trying to do what you can with them

2641
01:43:35,939 --> 01:43:39,178
um but if you can't do that then you

2642
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:41,099
make something special with it and

2643
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:42,779
sometimes that gets you know that's kind

2644
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:44,639
of like with what you have so trying to

2645
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:46,198
make special whatever things you can

2646
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:47,940
make as special as possible with what

2647
01:43:46,198 --> 01:43:51,178
you have available

2648
01:43:47,939 --> 01:43:53,579
fantastic fantastic so what sort of

2649
01:43:51,179 --> 01:43:56,639
things can we expect to see coming out

2650
01:43:53,579 --> 01:43:59,039
and how long away are they

2651
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,840
uh well there's the haste project that

2652
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:02,639
we talked about and that's been in works

2653
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,139
for several years already

2654
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,300
um so we were taking like the best

2655
01:44:04,139 --> 01:44:08,699
varieties that we've been growing over

2656
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:10,619
the years and kind of like going yeah

2657
01:44:08,698 --> 01:44:13,319
this line would be great for the his

2658
01:44:10,618 --> 01:44:16,618
project and we'd you know put that aside

2659
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:18,479
and then uh work on other plants so

2660
01:44:16,618 --> 01:44:20,219
we've been steadily going through the

2661
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:23,218
different varieties picking out the best

2662
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:25,980
plants for the haze project and then

2663
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:29,340
um we're making our crosses with the

2664
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:31,979
best plants and then we're uh

2665
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:34,079
also once we've done that individually

2666
01:44:31,979 --> 01:44:35,399
we're doing them with each other you

2667
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:37,439
know we send each other these different

2668
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:38,339
plants so the haze projects

2669
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:40,738
um

2670
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:43,139
are in the near future and the later

2671
01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:45,599
future so there should be some stuff

2672
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:48,480
coming out that will be kind of pre-haze

2673
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,980
project stuff that will be released so a

2674
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:51,359
lot of that should be picked up if a

2675
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:54,238
person can because it's going to be

2676
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:56,460
special in itself as well as what will

2677
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:57,599
be coming you know later on uh there's

2678
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:00,359
going to be

2679
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:02,159
I don't want to jinx myself but there's

2680
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:05,460
um there's going to be

2681
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:08,039
um like a hash Haze line but it's it's

2682
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:10,319
basically uh called Mirage it's

2683
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:12,060
basically using the best hash lines to

2684
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:14,639
make like a hash Haze but it's all

2685
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:18,420
different hash uh production varieties

2686
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:23,579
from around the world so like cashmere

2687
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:25,739
um Persian Turkish Lebanese uh Afghani

2688
01:45:23,579 --> 01:45:28,260
just using the best hash producing

2689
01:45:25,738 --> 01:45:31,198
varieties and creating like a haze

2690
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,219
version of that but not not Haze but a

2691
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:35,279
hash

2692
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:37,800
you know mix of the best plants

2693
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:40,439
um chocolate time trying to bring back

2694
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:43,020
several different chocolate ties as well

2695
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:45,419
as different pie varieties so I expect

2696
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:46,860
different Thai stick varieties

2697
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,819
um as well as chocolate ties and other

2698
01:45:46,859 --> 01:45:49,139
ties

2699
01:45:47,819 --> 01:45:51,420
um to

2700
01:45:49,139 --> 01:45:53,880
um be available at some point Mexican

2701
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:55,319
righties I'm trying to um

2702
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,779
bring back some of the heirloom

2703
01:45:55,319 --> 01:45:59,340
varieties that we've you know grown so

2704
01:45:57,779 --> 01:46:00,779
the first generation were like saving

2705
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:02,340
the plants

2706
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:03,960
um you know a lot of people go I grew

2707
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:06,360
one plant and it wasn't what I wanted

2708
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:09,600
from the line well one plant is going to

2709
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:12,299
be one variability in a line that

2710
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:14,880
needs work and saving in itself so

2711
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:17,039
people will get to experience

2712
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,960
um you know these Mexican varieties that

2713
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:20,639
you know give you happiness and awesome

2714
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,859
effects but if you're growing one plant

2715
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:24,300
you're only getting one aspect of the

2716
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:26,158
line so sometimes you need to go out

2717
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:29,279
more than one plant sorry guys you need

2718
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:30,839
to grow up more than one plan uh to

2719
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:32,579
experience the line and say if you like

2720
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,860
because some plants will give you or

2721
01:46:32,579 --> 01:46:37,380
some mines will give you several plants

2722
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:39,719
that are wonderful and great but some of

2723
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:41,960
them that are absolutely Stellar

2724
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:43,980
um just comes out from a few more plants

2725
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:45,600
not all the times do you have to grow

2726
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:48,059
out 100 plants to get these wonderful

2727
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,340
plants but if it's a preservation or

2728
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:52,440
conservation it's only been you know one

2729
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:55,440
year say the seeds were from the 60s or

2730
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:57,238
70s and they were you know maintained

2731
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:59,759
but barely maintained they need

2732
01:46:57,238 --> 01:47:01,138
selection so that first year of saving

2733
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,360
it

2734
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:05,219
um you're not going to get the best

2735
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:06,899
plants while you're the grower and

2736
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:09,359
growing these out so it may need another

2737
01:47:06,899 --> 01:47:11,399
generation or two before those beautiful

2738
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:13,319
Expressions the best expressions of the

2739
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:15,299
line come out for people so I'm going to

2740
01:47:13,319 --> 01:47:17,779
be working on bringing summer you know

2741
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:20,639
lines like the Acapulco Gold and others

2742
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:22,920
to make it more something that people

2743
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:25,319
remember as being that awesome smoke

2744
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:27,118
that they had back in the day some other

2745
01:47:25,319 --> 01:47:29,819
things are going to be some wine

2746
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:32,460
varieties I'm trying to bring that bring

2747
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:33,599
more of those uh available some of them

2748
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:36,060
were

2749
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,440
unknown Hawaiian varieties

2750
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:39,539
um I'm not going to say they were Maui

2751
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:42,899
Wally or Puna butter or something else

2752
01:47:39,539 --> 01:47:44,880
because I didn't know but they could be

2753
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:47,579
um some of them are fantastic wine lines

2754
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:50,039
but um I just I'm gonna say the time

2755
01:47:47,579 --> 01:47:51,960
frame that was from the island it may

2756
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:53,100
have been sourced from and leave it at

2757
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:55,380

01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:08,219
coming in the the near future but um you

2791
01:49:06,899 --> 01:49:10,500
know just like the Indian varieties will

2792
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:12,960
be coming after that in afghanis I'm

2793
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:15,539
also doing some Afghani lines uh there's

2794
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,880
just so much uh but you can only do so

2795
01:49:15,539 --> 01:49:19,618
much but I'm trying to preserve as well

2796
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:22,199
as making these lines

2797
01:49:19,618 --> 01:49:23,099
um as much as I can before it's too late

2798
01:49:22,198 --> 01:49:25,379
because

2799
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:27,480
um they become a viable pretty quick and

2800
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:29,639
if we can't maintain these the seed

2801
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:32,579
stock then it'll go bad so I'm trying to

2802
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:35,639
maintain them for everybody's future

2803
01:49:32,579 --> 01:49:36,779
because if I don't do it who knows who

2804
01:49:35,639 --> 01:49:37,859
will and

2805
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:39,539
um

2806
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:42,238
anyway I'm just trying to make more

2807
01:49:39,539 --> 01:49:43,920
stuff available for uh people while I'm

2808
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:46,439
here

2809
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:48,960
very Noble act and we're all very

2810
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:52,019
appreciative in amongst all those

2811
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:54,600
All-Star names you mentioned you

2812
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:56,520
reference the black Vietnamese we had a

2813
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:58,440
few questions about that could you just

2814
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:01,320
give us an overview of it it appears to

2815
01:49:58,439 --> 01:50:03,960
be quite a uh a fan favorite

2816
01:50:01,319 --> 01:50:06,059
yeah I mean there's the the the

2817
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,460
Vietnamese black was more of a jungly

2818
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:10,739
weed it was more from

2819
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:13,800
not the southern portion of Vietnam but

2820
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:16,500
more from not quite the China border but

2821
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:19,440
something that was near the Islam

2822
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:21,179
Province but more inside of uh

2823
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:23,399
Vietnam

2824
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:27,300
um in Vietnam it's been they've had a

2825
01:50:23,399 --> 01:50:30,299
huge loss of uh genetics I don't know is

2826
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:34,199
it's from the communism there but there

2827
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:37,079
isn't a lot of cannabis production even

2828
01:50:34,198 --> 01:50:39,359
um 20 years ago uh there was a lot more

2829
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:41,279
varieties and now it's it's really hard

2830
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:44,039
to find anything so there's been a lot

2831
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:47,099
of genetic loss unlike Thailand that's

2832
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:48,840
had resurgent Laos Cambodia Vietnam has

2833
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:50,400
lost a lot of the lines but uh the

2834
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:52,440
Vietnam Black was

2835
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:53,399
a jungle weed

2836
01:50:52,439 --> 01:50:54,960
um

2837
01:50:53,399 --> 01:50:56,698
somewhere somewhere around the same

2838
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,520
latitude as

2839
01:50:56,698 --> 01:51:03,419
um you know the esan area of Thailand

2840
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:05,580
which is more of the northeastern uh

2841
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:07,920
portion of Thailand which borders Laos

2842
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:11,880
and Cambodia that's kind of a special

2843
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:14,039
area there but more so on the Vietnamese

2844
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:15,000
side so it's like a thin Peninsula kind

2845
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:17,219
of like Florida

2846
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,899
a lot of the varieties that are now

2847
01:51:17,219 --> 01:51:20,219
there are from the southern portion

2848
01:51:18,899 --> 01:51:22,559
around

2849
01:51:20,219 --> 01:51:24,600
the South into Lots there's really

2850
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,699
nothing there anymore

2851
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:29,520
um my friend he's in his family is

2852
01:51:26,698 --> 01:51:33,000
indigenous from that uh part of Vietnam

2853
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:35,280
he's an indigenous Vietnamese

2854
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,158
um and he went looking for stuff and uh

2855
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:39,719
through his cousins and family and uh he

2856
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:41,939
wasn't able to find anything it's very

2857
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:43,800
rare and hard to find now

2858
01:51:41,939 --> 01:51:46,559
um so what we've been able to preserve

2859
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:48,779
is kind of like the last remnants of

2860
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,760
what was there at one time in Vietnam it

2861
01:51:48,779 --> 01:51:54,960
was um you know they used to have a a

2862
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:57,539
huge cannabis culture but um because of

2863
01:51:54,960 --> 01:52:00,300
what happens with um you know making

2864
01:51:57,539 --> 01:52:01,698
things illegal over time has caused a

2865
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:04,260
lot of eradication throughout the world

2866
01:52:01,698 --> 01:52:08,479
a lot of that eradication happened in

2867
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:11,280
the 1930s after alcohol prohibition was

2868
01:52:08,479 --> 01:52:13,379
changed over they decided to make

2869
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:16,198
cannabis illegal but they got that

2870
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:18,719
notion from the apartheid movement in

2871
01:52:16,198 --> 01:52:21,618
South Africa so a lot of the anti-drug

2872
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:26,158
laws that were created were to control

2873
01:52:21,618 --> 01:52:28,618
people in South Africa to like uh you

2874
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:31,979
know the the the people that were slaves

2875
01:52:28,618 --> 01:52:33,658
that were freed were controlled by use

2876
01:52:31,979 --> 01:52:36,419
of

2877
01:52:33,658 --> 01:52:39,599
creating cannabis being illegal because

2878
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:41,279
a lot of the native people were smoking

2879
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:43,800
cannabis so they made those illegal to

2880
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:45,960
try to control people then so in the

2881
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,360
1930s the United States incorporated

2882
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,399
some of that uh to also control the

2883
01:52:48,359 --> 01:52:52,139
Mexicans and the black people

2884
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:54,599
in the United States

2885
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:56,760
um through uh

2886
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,320
you know trying to scare the public into

2887
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,760
thinking they were rapists from

2888
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:02,219
consuming cannabis and different things

2889
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:05,219
there's a lot of literature put out

2890
01:53:02,219 --> 01:53:06,840
there that was just totally false just

2891
01:53:05,219 --> 01:53:09,300
trying to scare people but it was a way

2892
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,800
of controlling people and to

2893
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:13,679
um force them to go to a different

2894
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:17,039
country because uh at that time the

2895
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:18,840
stock market had crashed and people were

2896
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:21,539
you know scared of losing their jobs and

2897
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:23,639
didn't have money so they they went to

2898
01:53:21,539 --> 01:53:26,819
picking on people from you know

2899
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:30,300
neighboring Mexico or uh in some of the

2900
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:32,579
poorer regions of the Americas so that

2901
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:34,380
unfortunately caused the United States

2902
01:53:32,579 --> 01:53:37,260
to incorporate those laws which forced

2903
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:39,719
other countries like India that had a

2904
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:41,219
huge cannabis history and long long

2905
01:53:39,719 --> 01:53:44,219
reaching cannabis Street to make things

2906
01:53:41,219 --> 01:53:47,279
illegal and that forced all different

2907
01:53:44,219 --> 01:53:49,260
countries around the world to create the

2908
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:50,880
drug laws that they have now and a lot

2909
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:53,219
of them haven't reversed

2910
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:56,340
um reversed themselves like they have in

2911
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:59,219
the United States unfortunately really

2912
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:01,020
yeah it's got a very sort of checkered

2913
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:02,939
history doesn't it I guess this would be

2914
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:04,320
a good point to jump into what's your

2915
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:07,259
thoughts on the current state of

2916
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:08,759
legalization and what's your thoughts on

2917
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:10,739
the future of it do you think that we're

2918
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,360
going to move to a model where the the

2919
01:54:10,738 --> 01:54:13,919
average home grower slash small

2920
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:15,000
producers pushed out and it's all

2921
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,579
corporate

2922
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,800
well unfortunately a lot of the laws

2923
01:54:17,579 --> 01:54:21,118
that we as

2924
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,880
um you know

2925
01:54:21,118 --> 01:54:26,158
at

2926
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:28,679
democracy we vote for things but they

2927
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:32,158
get changed after we vote them so the

2928
01:54:28,679 --> 01:54:34,560
lawmakers change what we vote for so a

2929
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:35,939
lot of stuff is not what the people had

2930
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:39,360
voted for

2931
01:54:35,939 --> 01:54:41,039
um and that is sad because it forces out

2932
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,019
a lot of um

2933
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:45,139
you know people that could be growing it

2934
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:49,080
you know for medicine

2935
01:54:45,139 --> 01:54:51,060
for small farms for small businesses

2936
01:54:49,079 --> 01:54:54,260
they can create a lot of things you know

2937
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:57,300
for textiles for cement for medicine

2938
01:54:54,260 --> 01:55:00,539
there's so many uses for cannabis but

2939
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:02,699
unfortunately when these laws are voted

2940
01:55:00,539 --> 01:55:04,100
on and they're Changed by you know

2941
01:55:02,698 --> 01:55:07,859
companies

2942
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:09,600
that buy out these lawmakers and then

2943
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:11,279
no one's happy

2944
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:14,219
um except the people that have money to

2945
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:17,399
be able to circumvent these laws and um

2946
01:55:14,219 --> 01:55:20,460
you know establish businesses so

2947
01:55:17,399 --> 01:55:21,238
the state of things is not very good

2948
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:24,359
um

2949
01:55:21,238 --> 01:55:26,879
legalization would be great uh but the

2950
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:29,339
people need to have be able to grow what

2951
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:31,859
they want and then for people that can't

2952
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:33,900
grow what they can

2953
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:36,420
um they they need other people to grow

2954
01:55:33,899 --> 01:55:38,579
for them so there needs to be outlets

2955
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:41,158
for people to

2956
01:55:38,579 --> 01:55:43,920
um get their canvas grown for them and

2957
01:55:41,158 --> 01:55:46,019
then there needs to be studies on this

2958
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:48,960
stuff and we need to be able to

2959
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:52,320
um you know use this for pain medicine

2960
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:54,600
or for PTSD

2961
01:55:52,319 --> 01:55:57,359
um uses for Sleep anxiety depression

2962
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:59,460
there's so many medical uses for

2963
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:00,899
different ratios of cannabis and the

2964
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:04,859
different cannabinoids that can be

2965
01:56:00,899 --> 01:56:06,960
useful but the laws need to be changed

2966
01:56:04,859 --> 01:56:09,479
where more of that is available for

2967
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:12,420
people to study less of the big

2968
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:16,618
businesses need to

2969
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:19,199
um you know get less availability to uh

2970
01:56:16,618 --> 01:56:20,719
what the the typical man doesn't get so

2971
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:23,118
there should be equal laws I guess

2972
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:25,439
around the world it seems like

2973
01:56:23,118 --> 01:56:27,719
legalization is kind of opening up so

2974
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:29,939
hopefully I have

2975
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:30,899
um great hope that around the world we

2976
01:56:29,939 --> 01:56:33,658
will

2977
01:56:30,899 --> 01:56:35,460
you know get to a point where we're in a

2978
01:56:33,658 --> 01:56:38,339
better state but right now it's kind of

2979
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:41,639
all over the place and and it's not not

2980
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:44,699
good but um I am hopeful that

2981
01:56:41,639 --> 01:56:46,440
uh people will get together and

2982
01:56:44,698 --> 01:56:49,019
um vote for something that's truly

2983
01:56:46,439 --> 01:56:51,359
helpful for the the world because we

2984
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:53,100
could be offsetting global warming if we

2985
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:55,439
grew enough plants

2986
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:57,239
um we could be changing uh a lot of

2987
01:56:55,439 --> 01:56:59,039
these things that are being used for

2988
01:56:57,238 --> 01:57:00,779
wood we could be growing cannabis for

2989
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:02,460
construction uses everything there's

2990
01:57:00,779 --> 01:57:03,779
just so much that if we just converted

2991
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:07,920
it to cannabis

2992
01:57:03,779 --> 01:57:09,658
fuels textiles everything food nutrients

2993
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,940
supplements

2994
01:57:09,658 --> 01:57:13,859
um it's all there it just we just need

2995
01:57:11,939 --> 01:57:14,579
to make more use of it

2996
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:18,439
um

2997
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:21,420
yeah okay that was my answer

2998
01:57:18,439 --> 01:57:23,339
yeah certainly we can only hope that uh

2999
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:26,099
governments around the world adopt more

3000
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:29,159
of an open view on these things I guess

3001
01:57:26,099 --> 01:57:31,619
on the more individual level I'd love to

3002
01:57:29,158 --> 01:57:33,420
ask as we do a lot of our breeders what

3003
01:57:31,618 --> 01:57:35,939
would be your advice for someone who's

3004
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:37,500
just looking to get into breeding to

3005
01:57:35,939 --> 01:57:41,399
take their game a bit more seriously

3006
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:43,738
what would you uh say to them

3007
01:57:41,399 --> 01:57:47,638
uh I say um

3008
01:57:43,738 --> 01:57:49,738
just grow just grow plants

3009
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:51,359
um the more you grow the more experience

3010
01:57:49,738 --> 01:57:53,098
you get

3011
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:55,019
um try not to take

3012
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:56,819
what you read in these books as fact

3013
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:58,739
because there's a lot of BS out there

3014
01:57:56,819 --> 01:58:01,880
there's a lot of stuff that people just

3015
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:04,979
regurgitated that's not necessarily true

3016
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:07,440
so you know

3017
01:58:04,979 --> 01:58:09,059
take experience for what it is you know

3018
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:10,799
grow out the plants and and get your

3019
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:13,320
experience first

3020
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:16,260
um go ahead and breed and make some

3021
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:17,519
plants you know do some selections you

3022
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:19,679
don't have to grout hundreds of

3023
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:23,400
thousands of plants to to do some

3024
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:26,340
breeding but it's not helpful to take

3025
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:28,679
stressed out plants do pollen chucks

3026
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:31,860
with clones that you got from somewhere

3027
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:33,359
from someone and then you know try to

3028
01:58:31,859 --> 01:58:36,179
push those out to everybody else because

3029
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:38,519
those multi-poly hybrid pollen Chucks

3030
01:58:36,179 --> 01:58:39,840
are just not helpful to anybody

3031
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,400
um and then getting clones from

3032
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:44,219
everybody I think you should grow more

3033
01:58:41,399 --> 01:58:46,679
stuff from seed doing selections

3034
01:58:44,219 --> 01:58:48,719
yourself selecting plants it should be

3035
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:50,699
done more everybody's relying on other

3036
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:52,980
people to do the work for them so they

3037
01:58:50,698 --> 01:58:54,899
get these cuttings there's so many more

3038
01:58:52,979 --> 01:58:56,279
potent strains there's so many high

3039
01:58:54,899 --> 01:58:57,899
qualities that people are just not

3040
01:58:56,279 --> 01:58:59,819
experiencing you've seen people don't

3041
01:58:57,899 --> 01:59:01,799
experience you know a lot of the

3042
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:03,299
different highs and qualities it's

3043
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:04,560
because they're doing these clones that

3044
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:06,360
everybody else is growing out so you're

3045
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,159
only getting what other people are doing

3046
01:59:06,359 --> 01:59:10,738
but if they're growing stuff from seed

3047
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:12,719
they can see they can create their own

3048
01:59:10,738 --> 01:59:15,118
clones from these lines and you know

3049
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:17,279
have special plants it's very easy to

3050
01:59:15,118 --> 01:59:19,799
find a one pack of seed and get some

3051
01:59:17,279 --> 01:59:21,840
very very good

3052
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:23,279
um traits out of them and you just need

3053
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,560
to grow out the plants and experience

3054
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:27,599
them and don't be afraid of growing

3055
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:28,260
plants for a long period of time you

3056
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:30,659
know

3057
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:34,440
the best plants aren't the fastest

3058
01:59:30,658 --> 01:59:37,138
plants and don't kill plants that need

3059
01:59:34,439 --> 01:59:39,719
some nurturing because you know those

3060
01:59:37,139 --> 01:59:42,359
plants usually are the best plants if

3061
01:59:39,719 --> 01:59:44,219
you just you know give them the time to

3062
01:59:42,359 --> 01:59:45,598
to grow it's kind of like the ugly

3063
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:48,060
duckling you know it might look weird

3064
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:49,380
and you know offset but it'll grow out

3065
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:50,940
of that it'll grow out of those weird

3066
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:52,500
traits at first and once it's

3067
01:59:50,939 --> 01:59:53,638
established itself and you get these

3068
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,560
beautiful plants that you get to

3069
01:59:53,639 --> 01:59:57,599
experience

3070
01:59:54,560 --> 02:00:01,219
so grow all the plants don't kill

3071
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:03,420
everything and just because a plant is

3072
02:00:01,219 --> 02:00:06,420
experiencing intersex traits doesn't

3073
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:08,658
mean that they got bad seeds or

3074
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:11,639
something usually that's a sign that

3075
02:00:08,658 --> 02:00:14,399
they're under stress so they're they're

3076
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:17,579
being over watered or there's too much

3077
02:00:14,399 --> 02:00:20,399
nitrogen in the soil or there's insects

3078
02:00:17,579 --> 02:00:22,198
invading and chewing out their roots or

3079
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:23,759
you know sucking the life out of the

3080
02:00:22,198 --> 02:00:25,678
plant there's they're telling you

3081
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:28,199
there's something wrong so usually

3082
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:30,719
figure out what that problem is and then

3083
02:00:28,198 --> 02:00:32,000
and remedy the problem and then keep

3084
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:34,679
growing that plant

3085
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,779
but the real thing is for breeders that

3086
02:00:34,679 --> 02:00:39,679
are trying to get into it just grow the

3087
02:00:36,779 --> 02:00:39,679
plants and keep it simple

3088
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:44,158
some great advice there for sure and I

3089
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:46,320
definitely get behind that guys you can

3090
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:49,379
do some cool stuff even if you're not

3091
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,819
popping hundreds of thousands of seeds I

3092
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:52,500
guess I would love to quickly ask you

3093
02:00:50,819 --> 02:00:55,500
though if someone wanted to try to up

3094
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:57,599
their game a bit maybe take on a more

3095
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:59,460
raw line you know like try to feel your

3096
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:01,500
breed some Thai seeds or something you

3097
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:03,599
know like have a good go at it how many

3098
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:05,579
seeds do you think they should run given

3099
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:07,860
we know you tend to need a run through a

3100
02:01:05,579 --> 02:01:09,420
few more what what sort of number would

3101
02:01:07,859 --> 02:01:11,460
you throw at there is like just a

3102
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:13,920
ballpark figure

3103
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:16,920
uh well it's it's this it's hard to say

3104
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:18,719
so if if a line is raw there's no

3105
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,420
selections done you're gonna need a lot

3106
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:23,158
more seeds uh if a person has done a

3107
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:25,679
preservation and there's done selections

3108
02:01:23,158 --> 02:01:27,539
over a couple Generations or if it's a

3109
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:29,340
true breeding strain that's you know

3110
02:01:27,539 --> 02:01:30,000
been preserved

3111
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:32,279
um

3112
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,020
you'll need less seeds so if a person's

3113
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:36,300
worked the line

3114
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:38,580
um you may only need a pack of ten but

3115
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,800
20 is better

3116
02:01:38,579 --> 02:01:42,779
um but if you if you got a raw seed line

3117
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:46,380
that you know you're gonna need

3118
02:01:42,779 --> 02:01:48,420
selections you might need 30 50 seeds it

3119
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:49,560
all depends but you can still grow out

3120
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:51,480
those plants

3121
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:53,940
from a small selection

3122
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:55,439
make more seed and then from those seeds

3123
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:59,158
you'll have a lot more seeds to work

3124
02:01:55,439 --> 02:02:00,598
with so you can work with 10 to 20 seeds

3125
02:01:59,158 --> 02:02:03,359
it's going to take you a little longer

3126
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:05,400
you know use all the males females grow

3127
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:07,019
those out make seed from them and then

3128
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:07,799
you have thousands of seeds to select

3129
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:09,659
from

3130
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:12,779
the problem is when you get that many

3131
02:02:09,658 --> 02:02:15,118
plants is what do you select after that

3132
02:02:12,779 --> 02:02:17,880
point you know it just gets to be where

3133
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:19,920
there's so many plants that it it's hard

3134
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:21,900
to to make the selection so you really

3135
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:24,239
don't need thousands of plants unless

3136
02:02:21,899 --> 02:02:26,238
you're doing full large-scale breeding

3137
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:29,339
practices that's a that's a lot of work

3138
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:34,439
so basically you can narrow it down to

3139
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:37,260
you know 10 15 females uh four to six

3140
02:02:34,439 --> 02:02:39,960
males and you can do a lot of good

3141
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:42,239
breeding that way and you know as long

3142
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:43,618
as you have you're selected for certain

3143
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:45,598
things

3144
02:02:43,618 --> 02:02:47,698
um you know branchy plants you know

3145
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:50,039
things that are have odor resin

3146
02:02:47,698 --> 02:02:51,658
production good roots

3147
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:52,979
um you'll do well you know but there

3148
02:02:51,658 --> 02:02:54,658
should be a goal involved with the

3149
02:02:52,979 --> 02:02:56,698
breeding you should you should do it to

3150
02:02:54,658 --> 02:02:58,439
improve the line there shouldn't be just

3151
02:02:56,698 --> 02:03:00,479
you know Crossing this and that because

3152
02:02:58,439 --> 02:03:03,299
it's cool because you know what's the

3153
02:03:00,479 --> 02:03:04,379
use in that I mean that's fun but if

3154
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:06,060
you're if you really want to do some

3155
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:07,560
breeding you should have an end goal you

3156
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:10,619
know you want to

3157
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:12,420
um take a line that grows small and make

3158
02:03:10,618 --> 02:03:14,579
it grow big but keeping the same type of

3159
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:16,859
quality flowers that's you know a nice

3160
02:03:14,579 --> 02:03:18,899
goal to have for a lot of people

3161
02:03:16,859 --> 02:03:21,000
for instance

3162
02:03:18,899 --> 02:03:23,638
certainly you can only reach what you

3163
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:26,520
aim for I've seen in your work that

3164
02:03:23,639 --> 02:03:28,260
you've uh Incorporated deep chunk into a

3165
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:29,760
few of your lines and I guess it sort of

3166
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:31,980
fits that category of preservation

3167
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,900
what's your thoughts on Tom Hill's line

3168
02:03:31,979 --> 02:03:37,738
I've always been a fan

3169
02:03:33,899 --> 02:03:39,719
deep chunk I might have used one a long

3170
02:03:37,738 --> 02:03:40,799
long time ago with some purple Bubba

3171
02:03:39,719 --> 02:03:42,480
Kush

3172
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,300
um but I don't usually use deep chunk

3173
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:48,779
much deep chunk is very um

3174
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:52,800
uh it it stops all over the genetics

3175
02:03:48,779 --> 02:03:54,059
meaning it um it takes over it's it's a

3176
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,719
good quality

3177
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:58,500
um

3178
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:59,939
Indica broadleaf hash plant Afghani you

3179
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:03,658
know more of like a Missouri Sharif

3180
02:03:59,939 --> 02:04:05,698
shorter uh but larger flowers but not

3181
02:04:03,658 --> 02:04:07,979
too tall chunky

3182
02:04:05,698 --> 02:04:09,598
um it's good breeding material because

3183
02:04:07,979 --> 02:04:11,158
you can kind of you know what you're

3184
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:12,719
going to get out of it so if you breed

3185
02:04:11,158 --> 02:04:14,939
something into it and you see those

3186
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:16,739
traits you can kind of see what

3187
02:04:14,939 --> 02:04:18,960
um what the other line imparts into it

3188
02:04:16,738 --> 02:04:20,879
so it's a it's a good training line for

3189
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:22,079
breeding I guess

3190
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:23,400
because you know it's going to be

3191
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:25,260
consistent

3192
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:26,939
certainly and do you have any experience

3193
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:30,179
with any of these other lines like Pine

3194
02:04:26,939 --> 02:04:33,118
tarkush x18 his Haze

3195
02:04:30,179 --> 02:04:36,179
yeah I actually I I took the plantar

3196
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:37,139
Kush and I bred it into the

3197
02:04:36,179 --> 02:04:39,719
um

3198
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:42,359
it's a trolley and I bred that into the

3199
02:04:39,719 --> 02:04:44,399
OG Kush project I did and the reason I

3200
02:04:42,359 --> 02:04:48,238
did that was I wanted to impart real

3201
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:50,399
cush into the modern OG Kush so When

3202
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:51,839
people grew up my varieties they

3203
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:53,098
couldn't say oh there's no real cushion

3204
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:56,279
it because

3205
02:04:53,099 --> 02:04:57,779
you know it imparts both lines so I I

3206
02:04:56,279 --> 02:05:00,539
grew out those

3207
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:02,158
um the pine tartar Kush which is is

3208
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:04,920
pretty good line it kind of has an

3209
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:05,939
Afghani look to it but it's Pakistani

3210
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:10,079
um

3211
02:05:05,939 --> 02:05:12,719
has a good aroma profile and um yeah the

3212
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:15,960
the stable breeds from Tom Hill's work

3213
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:18,239
um so yeah uh Tom Hill's got some good

3214
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:21,239
work the x18 was good

3215
02:05:18,238 --> 02:05:23,218
um a nice uh Pakistani line similar to

3216
02:05:21,238 --> 02:05:23,819
the citrulli

3217
02:05:23,219 --> 02:05:25,859
um

3218
02:05:23,819 --> 02:05:29,279
lots of different Aromas fruit flavors

3219
02:05:25,859 --> 02:05:30,839
nice stuff uh not overly potent but a

3220
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:33,439
good breeding material kind of good to

3221
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:36,239
kind of breed with other things

3222
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:38,638
lovely lovely and I mean you just

3223
02:05:36,238 --> 02:05:40,379
touched on OG a moment ago you've done

3224
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:42,539
quite a few different crosses with

3225
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:45,300
different OG cuts and so I'd love to

3226
02:05:42,539 --> 02:05:47,819
hear your take on the different ogs if

3227
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:50,039
you have a preferred one and how some of

3228
02:05:47,819 --> 02:05:51,000
those crosses turned out

3229
02:05:50,039 --> 02:05:53,880
sure

3230
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:56,639
um so when I was growing for the medical

3231
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:59,880
clubs in the early 2000s

3232
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:02,159
um we were growing uh what was available

3233
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:03,659
in Northern California and then bring it

3234
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:05,939
to the medical clubs the medical clubs

3235
02:06:03,658 --> 02:06:08,819
wanted OG Kush

3236
02:06:05,939 --> 02:06:11,759
um so the medical clubs that I went to

3237
02:06:08,819 --> 02:06:15,259
they would take their OG Kush cuttings

3238
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:18,060
and they would have thousand watt HPS

3239
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:20,579
high pressure sodium lights growing

3240
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:23,699
under each plant lollipopped

3241
02:06:20,579 --> 02:06:27,000
um so huge lights lots of energy you

3242
02:06:23,698 --> 02:06:28,738
know huge electric bills and um in rooms

3243
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,840
just with these

3244
02:06:28,738 --> 02:06:34,019
um you know small plants producing not a

3245
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,699
whole lot but uh it was worth it to them

3246
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:37,560
because they were people were buying it

3247
02:06:35,698 --> 02:06:39,539
for a high dollar

3248
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,560
um but they they didn't yield with the

3249
02:06:39,539 --> 02:06:42,719
[ __ ]

3250
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:44,940
um they they grew poorly rooted poorly

3251
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:47,099
because most of them were derived from

3252
02:06:44,939 --> 02:06:48,419
like bag seeds someone's bag seed was oh

3253
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:50,880
this was some really good stuff so they

3254
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:53,880
grew it out usually from like you know

3255
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:55,739
stressed out situations it harmed so

3256
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:58,260
those stability issues with it but the

3257
02:06:55,738 --> 02:06:59,098
the smoke was really good

3258
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:02,639
um

3259
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:05,940
so I decide I asked the the one of the

3260
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:07,980
guys the place was uh uh G3 Collective

3261
02:07:05,939 --> 02:07:11,279
it was an Upland uh Southern California

3262
02:07:07,979 --> 02:07:14,698
and um there they try to fight the the

3263
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:15,979
state in the D.A and lost uh but anyway

3264
02:07:14,698 --> 02:07:19,738
uh

3265
02:07:15,979 --> 02:07:21,899
I asked him what are the two lines that

3266
02:07:19,738 --> 02:07:24,779
um have the highest quality flowers that

3267
02:07:21,899 --> 02:07:27,238
you guys love but don't yield much and

3268
02:07:24,779 --> 02:07:29,759
don't root well I'll I'll breed these

3269
02:07:27,238 --> 02:07:34,198
and and improve them and so he gave me

3270
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:35,639
the so-called so-called G13 cut and the

3271
02:07:34,198 --> 02:07:39,479
um

3272
02:07:35,639 --> 02:07:42,060
uh the true Kush uh cut and he said

3273
02:07:39,479 --> 02:07:44,098
these These are the best we have I wish

3274
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:48,060
they'd yield more and I wish they rooted

3275
02:07:44,099 --> 02:07:49,860
better so I basically bred

3276
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:52,619
um my idea was to breathe the modern

3277
02:07:49,859 --> 02:07:54,479
Kush with real Kush

3278
02:07:52,618 --> 02:07:56,939
um so I decided that I didn't like to

3279
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:59,339
reverse anything so this no reversing

3280
02:07:56,939 --> 02:08:01,859
the pollen you have unstable plants you

3281
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:04,800
you can't make anything stable from

3282
02:08:01,859 --> 02:08:07,679
instability so I decided to use real

3283
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:11,520
mail so I used the citralei which is a

3284
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:13,739
Pakistani uh line uh with the uh Pine

3285
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:16,679
Trek Bush and I found a male that was

3286
02:08:13,738 --> 02:08:18,598
more Afghani land race looking and I

3287
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:19,440
used that to pollinate

3288
02:08:18,599 --> 02:08:22,619
um

3289
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:24,359
the true Cush and then from there I I

3290
02:08:22,618 --> 02:08:26,219
basically grew up 50 plants and I

3291
02:08:24,359 --> 02:08:28,799
selected the best

3292
02:08:26,219 --> 02:08:31,198
um males and females so I worked down

3293
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:33,000
from 50 plants down to like 17 females

3294
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:35,579
down to like

3295
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,439
um nine males and then finally worked

3296
02:08:35,579 --> 02:08:41,158
out to the best

3297
02:08:37,439 --> 02:08:43,738
10 females and four best males and then

3298
02:08:41,158 --> 02:08:47,158
it worked down to the last uh three

3299
02:08:43,738 --> 02:08:50,339
males and the last seven females and

3300
02:08:47,158 --> 02:08:52,618
then I bred those to create the what I

3301
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:56,760
call true gangster Cush

3302
02:08:52,618 --> 02:08:59,519
um those two males I also use to breed

3303
02:08:56,760 --> 02:09:01,800
uh to the other OG cushes that was I was

3304
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:04,560
growing out and I over uh several years

3305
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:06,900
of going to all the clubs I collected

3306
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:10,020
all the different OG cushes from the San

3307
02:09:06,899 --> 02:09:13,079
Fernando Valley Kush the Skywalker

3308
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:16,380
um the Hell's Angels OG which is not the

3309
02:09:13,079 --> 02:09:19,738
same as my Hell's Angel line

3310
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:22,199
um there's also the Diablo OG the

3311
02:09:19,738 --> 02:09:23,698
abusive Ochi Kush

3312
02:09:22,198 --> 02:09:26,098
um there was the Fire OG from Northern

3313
02:09:23,698 --> 02:09:28,799
California and the SoCal Fire OG the Nor

3314
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:29,819
Cal Fire OG was a lot better

3315
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:33,179
um

3316
02:09:29,819 --> 02:09:34,979
and there was a lot of other ogs and uh

3317
02:09:33,179 --> 02:09:38,460
you know Master Kush and different lines

3318
02:09:34,979 --> 02:09:41,158
I grew at the same time Taho G

3319
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:43,139
um trying to find the best ogs so my my

3320
02:09:41,158 --> 02:09:46,138
selection criteria was finding the most

3321
02:09:43,139 --> 02:09:47,579
potent highest quality ogs but at the

3322
02:09:46,139 --> 02:09:49,260
same time I was trying to find ones that

3323
02:09:47,579 --> 02:09:51,300
grew well

3324
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:52,920
um and rooted well for the breeding

3325
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:53,880
purposes because

3326
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:55,739
um

3327
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:58,739
ones that would produce really good

3328
02:09:55,738 --> 02:10:00,238
flour but didn't grow very well weren't

3329
02:09:58,738 --> 02:10:02,939
worth it to me

3330
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:06,000
um so I excluded the San Fernando Valley

3331
02:10:02,939 --> 02:10:07,379
Kush because it didn't grow very well it

3332
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,719
was a short little plant produces

3333
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:12,779
wonderful great buds but from what I was

3334
02:10:09,719 --> 02:10:14,340
trying to do it didn't cut the mustard

3335
02:10:12,779 --> 02:10:16,139
um though I'd like to go back and do

3336
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:18,420
some breeding with it but not at the

3337
02:10:16,139 --> 02:10:20,219
time because it wasn't what I was

3338
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:21,899
looking for so the best cuttings that I

3339
02:10:20,219 --> 02:10:26,219
found were

3340
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:28,500
um the NorCal Fire OG and OG Kush we got

3341
02:10:26,219 --> 02:10:31,139
from the Hell's Angels in Oakland it was

3342
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:33,420
uh at the time 27 year old cut that they

3343
02:10:31,139 --> 02:10:35,279
had they just called OG Kush

3344
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:36,840
um I used that line to create the Hell's

3345
02:10:35,279 --> 02:10:38,158
Angel line

3346
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:42,239
um

3347
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:45,658
I also grout the Skywalker OG

3348
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:46,919
um which was the best one I felt it just

3349
02:10:45,658 --> 02:10:50,759
did the trick every time every time he

3350
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:52,980
smoked it it just you know check all the

3351
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:54,420
different boxes uh the abuse of OG was

3352
02:10:52,979 --> 02:10:56,698
another one that was very good yielding

3353
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:58,380
also high quality

3354
02:10:56,698 --> 02:10:59,759
um the two the best one was the OG Kush

3355
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:02,039
we've got for the Hell's Angels and the

3356
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:04,020
Skywalker those were my two favorite uh

3357
02:11:02,039 --> 02:11:05,698
the Tahoe was also a larger yielding

3358
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:06,900
good OG

3359
02:11:05,698 --> 02:11:10,019
um but not quite as good as the

3360
02:11:06,899 --> 02:11:10,738
Skywalker and the ojukush we got

3361
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:14,880
um

3362
02:11:10,738 --> 02:11:17,039
the fire o g at a SoCal was not very

3363
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,980
good yielding it was kind of wiry and it

3364
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:22,698
was good good uh buds but it just wasn't

3365
02:11:19,979 --> 02:11:25,678
growing very good the north calpharo G

3366
02:11:22,698 --> 02:11:28,079
yielded very well and had you know the

3367
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:29,579
same good characteristics as a SoCal one

3368
02:11:28,079 --> 02:11:31,618
but it was just a better plant in

3369
02:11:29,579 --> 02:11:35,099
general and I did some breeding with

3370
02:11:31,618 --> 02:11:37,139
that to make the uh the uh OG purple

3371
02:11:35,099 --> 02:11:41,819
fire timelines

3372
02:11:37,139 --> 02:11:43,980
um but uh Skywalker the abusive uh the

3373
02:11:41,819 --> 02:11:46,340
OG Kush we we made different lines with

3374
02:11:43,979 --> 02:11:49,979
those so I had bread with those

3375
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:52,980
unfortunately I had a warehouse in

3376
02:11:49,979 --> 02:11:54,238
Southern California which I was using um

3377
02:11:52,979 --> 02:11:57,779
when I came down here to do some

3378
02:11:54,238 --> 02:12:00,238
breeding but uh it got sabotaged so all

3379
02:11:57,779 --> 02:12:00,960
the cuttings all the different

3380
02:12:00,238 --> 02:12:04,919
um

3381
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:07,739
things I was doing to to bulk the OG

3382
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:09,000
lines the true gangster Kush projects

3383
02:12:07,738 --> 02:12:11,939
that I'd done

3384
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,198
um was lost so I only have a small

3385
02:12:11,939 --> 02:12:15,598
amount of seed left but I need to

3386
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:18,299
revisit those for people but that that

3387
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:20,279
whole OG project got squashed because of

3388
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:23,219
all the loss of all the plants for

3389
02:12:20,279 --> 02:12:26,039
reproduction and all the different uh

3390
02:12:23,219 --> 02:12:28,380
the Clones that I lost I lost a juice

3391
02:12:26,039 --> 02:12:31,618
fruit Thai

3392
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:33,659
um you know the one the various lines

3393
02:12:31,618 --> 02:12:36,118
the Maui Wowie different things that uh

3394
02:12:33,658 --> 02:12:38,460
you know I don't have anymore

3395
02:12:36,118 --> 02:12:40,500
wow that's a bummer to hear you lost

3396
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:41,880
that I mean right at the end of the

3397
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:43,439
story you mentioned yeah you lost the

3398
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:44,819
one what's your thought on that it sort

3399
02:12:43,439 --> 02:12:46,500
of come more to the Forefront of

3400
02:12:44,819 --> 02:12:48,599
discussions with um a few different

3401
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:50,219
breeders using it do you think it's as

3402
02:12:48,599 --> 02:12:51,840
good as what some people make it out to

3403
02:12:50,219 --> 02:12:56,099
be

3404
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:57,239
well I I smoked it years ago and uh but

3405
02:12:56,099 --> 02:12:58,619
at the time

3406
02:12:57,238 --> 02:13:00,019
um when I smoked it there was an

3407
02:12:58,618 --> 02:13:03,420
earthquake

3408
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:04,860
so uh I didn't I I didn't know if there

3409
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:06,840
was the earthquake or the smoke that

3410
02:13:04,859 --> 02:13:08,759
kind of hit me a certain way I think it

3411
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:09,719
was kind of the the combination the two

3412
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:11,699
so

3413
02:13:09,719 --> 02:13:13,618
um it's it's definitely got

3414
02:13:11,698 --> 02:13:15,059
um it's a special potent weed it's

3415
02:13:13,618 --> 02:13:17,539
definitely got some great qualities to

3416
