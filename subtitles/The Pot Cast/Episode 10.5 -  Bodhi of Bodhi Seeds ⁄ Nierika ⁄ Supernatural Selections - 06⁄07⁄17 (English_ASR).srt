1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,759
hello and welcome to the next episode of

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:17,760
the podcast a cannabis podcast for buddy

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,670
enthusiasts so here we have it folks the

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,410
second part of the podium today as

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,039
always this episode was brought to us by

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:32,009
organic gardening solutions for 20

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:38,429
Australia and all think bode ID ready to

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:41,308
jump back into it here we go a little

9
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:44,219
bit of a two-parter how do you feel

10
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,828
about the idea of certain gear or cuts

11
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,870
so to speak having kind of bad but I

12
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,308
just sociated with and this is an idea

13
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,429
I've heard a few times I guess the most

14
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,409
notable example would be you know and I

15
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,329
could be wrong here but I think I'm

16
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,698
pretty correct I'm fairly confident that

17
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,739
Indian guys specific instructions

18
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,739
whether he didn't want anyone to like

19
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,810
kind of F to the g13 hash plant that

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,189
seems to have kind of happened you know

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,478
I know that you bury that you didn't F

22
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:12,658
to assess we're not talking about you

23
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,429
obviously do you feel that like in that

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,840
such situation where someone has made it

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,159
fairly clear their intentions and then

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,900
some other party has kind of done the

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,368
opposite of that do you feel there is

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,868
such a thing as kind of bad vibes

29
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,609
associated with that year or not

30
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,359
necessarily it's just a shame that that

31
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,469
person's intentions were respected I

32
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,478
think it's kind of a shame I mean I

33
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,390
think it applies in different ways like

34
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,250
I think for Indiana it's a special kind

35
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,280
of thing because he's kind of like a

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,769
deep grandfather of a lot of people like

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,060
he's an old-timer and he was a big seed

38
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:44,519
collector and he has a lot of amazing

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,859
stuff and he's very altruistic and he's

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,109
in giving and he gives he'll give you

41
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,149
know the most rare seeds effort to like

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,430
some new guy that you know maybe that

43
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,140
just started like he he's he's kind of

44
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,990
like this unique Santa Claus and I think

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,368
for someone that does that I mean I've

46
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,559
heard him get in trouble too of giving

47
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:04,530
out stuff that he's not supposed to but

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,060
he for him I think you know with elders

49
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,950
especially I think we should kind of

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,618
respect that and his whole thing was he

51
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,330
wanted that strain to be kind of like he

52
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:12,990
wanted to be free he wanted people to

53
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,280
enjoy

54
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,020
and you want to do it in this big thing

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,990
was yeah you can make hybrids but you

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,380
can't Hut you can't f2 it for money so

57
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,210
I'm pretty sure you can give it away but

58
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,650
you know talk to him for a while but

59
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,680
there does seem to be a lot of those

60
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,750
kind of strange cuts and it's mostly

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,610
people just kind of I understand if

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,229
they're really rare and if people spend

63
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,020
a tremendous amount of time or it's

64
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:40,709
enough or it's it's a family strain that

65
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,600
goes back generations but I think that's

66
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,340
where communication comes in if you know

67
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,379
if people are open and they communicate

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,689
about what they want to do what things

69
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,969
are there doesn't need to be bad blood

70
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,960
or things and it's sad when a string

71
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:56,699
gets that kind of energetic kind of gunk

72
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,189
on it because it holds that you know

73
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,679
just like every seed is kind of a prayer

74
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,569
that's just waiting to be popped open

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,490
and through epigenetics it holds not

76
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,780
only its history going back through time

77
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,270
but all the cultures that you don't

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,729
realize it like a seed is this I mean

79
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,620
people don't realize how amazing it is

80
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:17,310
it's this kind of dusky jewel that that

81
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,710
that transforms time into you know into

82
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,120
a tangible way to interact with it so

83
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,070
yeah it's it's basically like a

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,319
bejeweled time machine that holds

85
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,269
everything so I think you know these

86
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,519
seeds and clones and everything are very

87
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,230
sick and very special and they don't

88
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,820
need to have this thing around and I you

89
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,709
know there are instances where like I

90
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,810
said with families I'll hold that but I

91
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,400
don't know it's tricky I think it comes

92
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,860
down to really to communication and if

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,020
people have something that you want them

94
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,610
that you want to keep to yourself you

95
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,830
probably shouldn't give it out because

96
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,990
things get out you know people are human

97
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,050
and it's like if you give it out it's

98
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:54,180
probably gonna get out and it's it's you

99
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,100
know I don't know I understand it from

100
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,770
all different things all different

101
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,689
viewpoints but really it's a joke comes

102
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,320
down to communication I think and that's

103
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:07,979
where it's gonna happen you know yeah

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,750
sure so are there any cuts which you

105
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,939
don't like to work with from maybe say

106
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,009
the kind of the more modern elite clones

107
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,150
maybe not necessarily due to what we

108
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:16,439
were just talking about but maybe just

109
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,480
in general you don't particularly like

110
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,430
working with them are there any you know

111
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,460
kind of popular modern elite clones that

112
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,790
fall into that category for you you know

113
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:28,409
I veer away from work of

114
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,210
and breeders that I don't jive with I

115
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,610
would step back to everybody but at some

116
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:36,449
time I won't usually breed with clones

117
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:40,379
from someone that I are lies on jive

118
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:43,199
with so much and four clones you know

119
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,990
and I don't know if there's a lie if

120
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,029
it's a really like if it has a lot of

121
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,910
drama around it I kind of stay away with

122
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,439
it from unless unless I know who it came

123
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,050
from and I can kind of communicate with

124
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,620
them like gg4 like you know I know

125
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,840
either I can communicate and I could

126
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,280
offer up what I what I want to do and

127
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,560
they could respect that and I could

128
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,789
respect them and that could happen like

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,560
you know and people that have special

130
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,689
things like if there's a communication

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,129
there I think it's okay and but there

132
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,810
are a lot of clones that just get out

133
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,269
into the wild and people go with it and

134
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,069
if people get uptight and no no it's

135
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:21,810
it's none of those kind of communication

136
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,029
things it's such a strange thing I wish

137
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,709
people would kind of stop chasing these

138
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:27,989
clones and really just start popping

139
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,519
their seat collections you know and also

140
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,410
you know I could see kind of like a new

141
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,479
interesting trend it's like before I

142
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,860
would just be these amazing clones that

143
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,810
people would have that pop up like the

144
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,370
cams and the ojiisan now but now you're

145
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,810
seeing people that have that have kind

146
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,680
of like a good vibe and a good internet

147
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,780
presence like a picture later or skunk

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,480
master flex you'll have like the GMO

149
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,219
cookies and caps got the Mac and just

150
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,259
from their good vibes and them hyping it

151
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,460
on their up their strain that they

152
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,439
really like that they've created they've

153
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:58,289
kind of created their own elites and I

154
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,269
think so not we're not just finding me

155
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,980
more we're kind of creating them and I

156
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:04,049
think that I was gonna show people that

157
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,480
anyone can find these special elites and

158
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,250
then hey if people have a problem it's

159
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,810
like then you have a your own special

160
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,300
elite you guys can trade it's like I

161
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,980
think people should stop chasing and

162
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,160
start creating you know I think people

163
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,200
we have so much to uncover that it's

164
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,970
kind of we don't want to just be chasing

165
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,670
our tails anymore even though it's fun

166
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,830
and the strains are pretty cool these

167
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,040
days but I think there's a lot more to

168
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:31,589
really explore so with that in mind how

169
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,060
important do you feel it is that new

170
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,060
seeds are constantly being popped

171
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,879
because for example in Australia

172
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,800
I find people aren't don't really pop

173
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,689
that many seeds so to speak at least on

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,980
average and I try to tell them in my

175
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,870
opinion at least it seems like that's

176
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,340
what drives the progression of the scene

177
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,139
in a way you know like the new things

178
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,549
coming out that people can enjoy you

179
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,339
know how do you feel about that and does

180
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,720
that play into your philosophy of making

181
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,569
everyone's because it's almost a way of

182
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,830
facilitating that yeah I mean in

183
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,079
California it's kind of different is

184
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:02,789
there's a clone culture and it's kind of

185
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,129
changing now especially without doing

186
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,410
people realizing that seeds are just so

187
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,569
much more vibrant in the root system is

188
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:13,470
so much more amazing and they don't have

189
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:15,480
all the STDs that all the clones do but

190
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,980
you know California is it is a clone

191
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,290
culture and it's a hype culture it's

192
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,330
driven by music is driven by coolness is

193
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,520
driven by you know thing you know you

194
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,490
know even if a strain maybe isn't the

195
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,959
ultimate strain if you get rappers

196
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,550
smoking and rapping about it you know

197
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,409
cookies a good example cookies amazing

198
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,000
strain it's really cool but there's a

199
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,580
lot of drama around there's a lot of

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,189
people saying you know this and that and

201
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,319
it makes cool hybrids it's neat but it's

202
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,360
people are you know it takes for people

203
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,269
just people will latch onto something

204
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,800
and just take it you know just hammer it

205
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:48,829
to the ground and it's it's like kind of

206
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,540
sad for the strain itself it's like I

207
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,009
would love to see people popping seeds

208
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,290
and I think it's happening more and I

209
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,719
think people are getting more into it I

210
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,120
just worry about the future and the way

211
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,280
things are going you know maybe

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,709
eventually mr. Khanna's because really

213
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,909
cheaper and there's lots of brands and

214
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,029
there's lots of people pumping it out

215
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,340
that people won't really have the

216
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:13,529
impetus to pop seeds maybe people just

217
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:16,409
do it ornamentally or just for crafts

218
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:18,809
but I really think that yeah everything

219
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,400
comes from a seed and it all of our best

220
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,410
stuff is always that's just where it

221
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,639
comes from I mean that's its origin

222
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,430
that's where you're gonna find it and

223
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,409
that's where we should be looking yes I

224
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,259
mean if we kind of tap into the mindset

225
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,360
of the people who are kind of promoting

226
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,669
that clone community at least

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,919
subconsciously a lot of what I hear from

228
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,779
these types of folk is that you know the

229
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,939
the elite clones are just so far

230
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,129
superior to you know most things you'd

231
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,640
get out of seeds that storm is not worth

232
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:48,960
bothering with seeds with that in mind

233
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,740
do you find there's a big variation

234
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,970
between the elite

235
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,860
like do you find that there are some

236
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,389
cuts that definitely consider delete you

237
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,860
know they're just phenomenal in every

238
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,629
way then there are others which may be

239
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,070
considered elite by the masses but they

240
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,220
just really kind of don't stand up

241
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,310
compared to the other one for example

242
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,570
yeah I think too there's also sometimes

243
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,949
in the clone world you get a lot of

244
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,330
different clones like I'm sure they're

245
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,740
you know there's at least two blue dream

246
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,600
clones there's a really good blue dream

247
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,889
clone that I love I think where dreams

248
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,659
also by Blue Gene gets a lot of flack

249
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,909
and I think it's because people grow the

250
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,189
really bland quicker more indica version

251
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:22,620
of blue dream and I don't know I think

252
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,420
there's clones that are at least because

253
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,870
they have a history they've performed

254
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:29,789
for you know 10 20 years and they have a

255
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,159
really special uniqueness to them and

256
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,649
they always kind of hit home just where

257
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,110
you want them and then there's a lot of

258
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:40,169
the especially in the new hyper Turkey

259
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,180
kind of I call it kind of a pop art

260
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:45,120
breeding kind of like derivative

261
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:46,859
breeding where it's people are

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,389
everybody's kind of everything's

263
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,830
derivative of itself and people are

264
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:52,049
smashing everything together and it's

265
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,209
kind of that Andy Warhol style breeding

266
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,370
where it's very neon it's very flashy

267
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:58,169
it's bright it's loud you're really

268
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,100
hitting all the boxes with flavor and

269
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:03,360
smell and it's more for the kind of like

270
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,579
recreational kind of dab culture that

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,399
loves the more they love the enjoyment

272
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:11,939
of the flavors and tastes more than

273
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:17,159
maybe so the effects or the the origins

274
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:19,290
and so you know it's it kind of comes

275
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,049
down to it it's like if I'm an elite

276
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:24,599
spin on leap for more than five years I

277
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:26,609
think it you know like oh gee no one's

278
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,129
gonna dispute that that's not an awesome

279
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,839
plan Kim Kim as no one's gonna dispute

280
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,549
that but there's new stuff that comes

281
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,779
online and people chase everyday that

282
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,639
you know that and it's hard for me I

283
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:36,929
like to I find it fascinating and I'd

284
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,149
love to try all these new things and I

285
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,949
trying to keep abreast you know like all

286
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,320
the new stuff like the purple punches

287
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,079
and the Sunday drivers and the orange

288
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,300
trees and the lemons this and then I

289
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,729
love checking all those out and I loved

290
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,649
seeing that but you know a lot of times

291
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,019
those don't last more than a year or two

292
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:57,659
you know then 16 with cookies cookies is

293
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,458
a great well it's it's held itself up

294
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,409
and you know people love it and it's

295
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,208
probably last in the test of time but

296
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:05,308
there's a lot of derivatives kind of

297
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,928
one offs that pop in enough kind of like

298
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:08,009
bubbles they probably surface people get

299
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:12,119
really into it and when enough people

300
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:14,970
try it they're kind huh so I think it's

301
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:19,528
more elites it's what what passes the

302
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:21,629
test of time you know and so do you ever

303
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:24,240
have any intentions of ever delving back

304
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:27,420
into some of the really old-school stock

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,399
like you know SSS say for example we've

306
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,399
got the temple you know a good example

307
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,919
of where you've done that would you ever

308
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,078
be interested in doing it more and if

309
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,610
not is that because you know the future

310
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,248
excites you so much

311
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,019
oh no I love vintage lines and that's

312
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:44,730
kind of my one of my things for

313
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,169
Supernatural selections is like I really

314
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,759
get to get deeper into those and I

315
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:49,349
actually have a lot of stuff going on

316
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,499
right now that you know some of my old

317
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,778
stuff of like beaches choice and NL too

318
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:58,290
and you know like all these really

319
00:11:54,778 --> 00:12:00,480
unique old vintage ones I have on you

320
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:02,639
know from older seed companies I have I

321
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,449
have a really nice friend who was

322
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,490
instrumental in some of the early Nevel

323
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:10,198
working since you work he and he sends

324
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,339
me some really cool stuff and I love

325
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:13,109
getting stuff from him and sometimes

326
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,149
it's old junk and it turns out funny but

327
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,459
I just love seeing it because it's like

328
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:18,928
a snapshot to a snapshot to a bygone era

329
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,268
you know it's like you really get to see

330
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:23,039
and it's neat to see what people

331
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:26,339
remember and then what they're really

332
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,019
the reality is you know because you know

333
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,769
over time people granule eyes their

334
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,539
memories and they change and but I love

335
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,249
vintage stuff it's one of my favorite

336
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:36,868
things to pop and then whenever I can I

337
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:39,839
do you know if and I have a quite a good

338
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:41,670
collection of vintage seeds but I can

339
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,049
only do so much and since I do kind of

340
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,878
have to work on a couple different

341
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:47,308
levels I kind of have to partition

342
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,589
myself so let's say like 50 percent goes

343
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:51,868
to Bodhi seeds and then 10 percent goes

344
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,689
to vintage and 10 15 percent goes to

345
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:57,089
Norika and now I think maybe like 30

346
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:59,129
percent will go to supernatural

347
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,110
selections so I just I have to find that

348
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,420
kind of pie chart that makes everything

349
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,759
move forward so I can pay the rent and

350
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,490
also explore everything I can and also

351
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,470
you know follow my own passion and also

352
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,178
create things so people can follow their

353
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,829
own passion but yeah I would love to see

354
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:15,679
more vintage stuff come out and I I

355
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:17,088
really get excited and I love

356
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,829
stuff that Mean Gene pulls out of his

357
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,110
hat well he has a lot of cool vintage

358
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,639
stuff and yeah people are just popping

359
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,409
on the woodwork with all these unique

360
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,360
lines I'm like whoa that still exists

361
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:30,069
you know it's like wow someone has that

362
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,139
it's I'm excited about vintage lines

363
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,360
yeah I mean speaking on one specifically

364
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,429
talked of Kabul has always been one

365
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,570
that's being quite interesting to me and

366
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,250
I think it's probably because of the

367
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,870
elusive any of it so to speak

368
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,458
what was that strain like and do you

369
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,720
ever plan to use it again or have you

370
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:49,278
maybe lost it you know I like talkable I

371
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,040
like all those rough although Afghan

372
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,269
ease their their little you know it

373
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,708
depends on what you're getting there a

374
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:56,750
little bit blend the talking football

375
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:59,179
was unique in that you know it's from

376
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,879
Marx Castle mark is like he's an amazing

377
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:03,379
old character guy I think he kind of

378
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,600
hyped it up a little bit cuz I don't

379
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,909
from what I don't totally agree with

380
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,220
what he said about it maybe I didn't

381
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:12,919
grow it to its full potential or even

382
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,639
outdoors but to me it's a really nice

383
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:19,939
commercial eff like modern and Afghani

384
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,069
like it's kind of that bland but dark

385
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,550
it's got the raw power of Afghani it's

386
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:28,820
got good good strength but as a breeding

387
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:31,939
plant its kind of bland and kind of blah

388
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,430
in a way but for where it is you know I

389
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm not growing it in the arid high

390
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:40,338
desert of Afghanistan and I'm not really

391
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,958
making I'm sure making hash with it is

392
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:45,459
phenomenal and that's kind of what I use

393
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:48,409
it in is one of my deep line I'll coming

394
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:50,750
crosses which is kind of focusing on the

395
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:52,429
kind of like traditional plants that

396
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,860
were used for hash making and kind of

397
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:57,829
hybridizing those with the g13 hash plan

398
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,480
or other indicas and it's it's a cool

399
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,070
plan it's also he also had another one

400
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,570
called warlord that came from the same

401
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:07,129
thing in the whole deal with that was I

402
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,690
guess there was a was in like 2002 or 96

403
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,360
one of it was way back when somewhere

404
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:15,110
the Special Forces went in rated of

405
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,409
warlord and there was growing a lot of

406
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,329
really amazing cannabis for hash and it

407
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:22,219
was the big talk in Kabul everybody

408
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:23,539
loved that hash and the Special Forces

409
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,610
went in and raided it and someone

410
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,169
grabbed the seeds and brought them back

411
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,759
from that

412
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:29,620
so it was one of those cool kind of like

413
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,970
all those old it really cool Afghani to

414
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,490
have that backstory kind of like a link

415
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,410
technology has its backstory and you

416
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,450
know everyone I like those old kind of

417
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:41,799
things and they actually if we're

418
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:45,640
talking about crazy old Afghani style

419
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,289
stuff straight Fox got some seeds from I

420
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,439
think it's from his brother who served

421
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:52,719
over in Iraq in Rania and those seeds

422
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,300
are amazing like it is like a dead

423
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,769
ringer for like if you could take pure

424
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,549
Kush and cookies and put them together

425
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:02,110
like this

426
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:03,879
spicy bread II like Persian bakery smell

427
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,220
and like it's really beautiful heavy

428
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,860
body like it reminds me kind of like the

429
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,960
Hollywood pure cush the one or the LA

430
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,860
pure Krishnaji like one but the more

431
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:19,960
like feminine cushy kind of baby power

432
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:22,389
ask one like there's some amazing yeah

433
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,009
kind of like the LA pure but kind of

434
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:27,159
more in the kind of the bubble realm but

435
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,659
with but yeah there's some of those old

436
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,129
Afghan ease are amazing and that's kind

437
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,959
of what I'm excited this year I'm doing

438
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:34,240
a lot of really old weird Afghan ease

439
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,190
outside I'm doing like my artifact one

440
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,259
which is kind of like the Afghani that

441
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,150
everybody remembers but no one's been

442
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:43,149
able to procure like that super accurate

443
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:45,909
almost roadkill like cabbagey kind of

444
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:48,039
like a deep chunky but not as bland as

445
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:50,370
deep chunk kind of this really raw kind

446
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:53,019
of like I don't know it smells like a

447
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,759
prison basketball game or something I

448
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,769
don't know but you know I just like

449
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,200
exploring all the weirdest things but

450
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:01,600
yeah the taco cabal cool line cool

451
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,269
breeder but on its own I don't think

452
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,130
that the best it's interesting because

453
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:08,529
you just touched on about four or five

454
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,570
questions which we'll get to soon enough

455
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:12,338
first question though I'm a huge deep

456
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,799
chunk fan I'm a huge Tom Hill thinner I

457
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:16,809
love all of his work even mentioned

458
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,659
about this at the Emerald cup I've never

459
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:21,338
found a deep chunk which I was satisfied

460
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,930
with the flavor kind of like how you

461
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:25,269
describe the talk of Kabul it was always

462
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,769
a bit lackluster in my opinion did you

463
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:28,449
have you found the same like I mean I've

464
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:29,529
found good use for it as a breeding tool

465
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:31,330
because you know there's still a lot of

466
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:33,069
desirable characteristics around it but

467
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:34,509
you know have you ever found a female

468
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:36,369
where you were like damn you know this

469
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:39,119
has got a good taste as well as all

470
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:41,699
those other deep chunk traits you know

471
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,469
long time ago I found one deep chunk and

472
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,850
I was like I call it like the sativa

473
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,500
Fein arson by which it's not of course

474
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:48,000
it was just a little bit more stretchy

475
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,230
and a little bit more flavorable and it

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,808
was kind of a seemed like a throwback

477
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,210
that's the only other one I mean other

478
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:56,460
than that they all they're so in bred

479
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,100
and they're so you know I mean that

480
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,870
plant is like full-on dinosaur Jurassic

481
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,839
Park like it must have been inbred

482
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:06,000
through some families in Afghanistan for

483
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,789
hundreds of years like it is like

484
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,769
basically it's also the ultimate like

485
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,178
fun learning Afghani to breed with that

486
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:14,099
was my first Afghani that I really got

487
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,990
into and kind of bread with and even I

488
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:18,839
did some of my early lines I wore deep

489
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,670
crosses it turns everything into Z chunk

490
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,558
which is amazing but you get just like

491
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,650
you know what I mean it just it is like

492
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,629
terminator of plants and it has a really

493
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,460
cool effect like my sister really those

494
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,809
deep chunk like just makes her laugh and

495
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,170
it makes her feel good it has a really

496
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:37,170
it has that classic just take you home

497
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,750
Huggy kind of vibe I mean it doesn't

498
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,340
always behave indoors like you know all

499
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,140
the Tom stuff is more for outdoors

500
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,839
anyways and that's where I was bred but

501
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,179
deep chunk you know it's like if we were

502
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,000
teaching a course like it's the textbook

503
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,100
Afghan like you can't get any more like

504
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,940
textbook Afghan even like like that's

505
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,439
kind of like if you ever saw that

506
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,880
picture of Richard Evan Schall T's and

507
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,429
wherever he wasn't Afghanistan he's

508
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,170
standing by those really squat old

509
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,880
plants I think I was in the 40s like it

510
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,920
looks that basically looks like deep

511
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,480
chunk and that I think deep chunk is

512
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,160
it's pretty cool even though I don't

513
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,069
really enjoy breeding with it because it

514
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,558
just turns everything in deep trunk now

515
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:17,099
ever found that myself a lot I found one

516
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,500
male where kind of isn't so dominant

517
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,149
like it turns everything phenotypically

518
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,250
into deep chunk but I found this one now

519
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,900
where a lot of the mothers kind of the

520
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,069
high and the taste seems to shine

521
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,809
through so I'm enjoying playing with

522
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:31,980
that but like Jesus that flavor has got

523
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:33,480
some serious issues with it like but on

524
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,490
another little interesting side note I

525
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,710
found a female that had just this

526
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,839
amazing highest where it must have had a

527
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,819
really significant percentage CBD in it

528
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,379
but I called it the face melter cuz it

529
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,779
was great you know it was like having um

530
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,900
I mean like a warm water port over your

531
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:50,700
face it was awesome like a massage yeah

532
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,890
I missed those like yeah like a body

533
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,789
massage bud

534
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,770
yeah so I mean just dipping back on a

535
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:00,529
thing you mentioned a few questions ago

536
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:03,109
do you think there is you know a certain

537
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:04,789
amount of romanticism around strains

538
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:09,019
from years gone by I mean the typical

539
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:10,548
ones being you know haze ty roadkill

540
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,720
skunk that's a great one you know I've

541
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:13,369
never experienced the roadkill skunk

542
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,600
myself so I'm still a bit on the fence

543
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:16,789
especially because a lot of the people

544
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:18,980
who I I really trust their opinions they

545
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,269
speak so highly of it but I mean I hear

546
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,860
stories about you know people will say

547
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,750
like oh you know you'd smell it in a

548
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:25,399
guy's pocket before it even walked in

549
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,380
the house and it's like is that really

550
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,000
true like I've never had anything close

551
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,080
to that happen to me with modern

552
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,940
cannabis was it really that strong uh

553
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,589
you know I I think there was a lot of

554
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,610
really special old strains back there

555
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:40,279
and I think you know what they always

556
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:41,719
say is like if you remember the 60s you

557
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,490
weren't there kind of thing I think

558
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,990
there's a lot of there's a lot of old

559
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,910
stoners that have a lot of fond memories

560
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,289
of their youth and they kind of believe

561
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,090
in things but there was some strains

562
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,889
that really stood out and especially I

563
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,359
think a lot of the import from these

564
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,580
point of origin places where they had

565
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,928
all the terroir and they had all that

566
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,939
and they brought it through those things

567
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:00,710
would really they would really ring some

568
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,200
bells and you know the roadkill

569
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,819
strengthing I mean that's it that's

570
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,548
something that I've been kind of playing

571
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:10,428
with for years and I can't get it right

572
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:12,168
like I've done so many different hybrids

573
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:15,559
and so many out crosses and I can get

574
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:18,049
like it get almost right but then it it

575
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:20,660
won't cure out skunky or you know or

576
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:23,929
it'll be too pissy or it won't be strong

577
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,840
enough like you know it's there and I

578
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:29,600
really think that with the roadkill

579
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:32,149
stunk yeah I think it was probably a

580
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,039
really hideous old Afghani one of those

581
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,100
Afghani that was bred forever to be

582
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,928
super super strong for their hash and I

583
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:41,178
think it really kicked people's ass but

584
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:43,700
you know it also got people busted and I

585
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,470
also think that that terpene I think it

586
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,090
must have some kind of a lower molecular

587
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,519
weight or something because I think it

588
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:52,039
vaporizes pretty quick because outside

589
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,058
it'll smell for blocks like people so

590
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,889
you know of course people are getting it

591
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,149
busted like you can't miss it it's my

592
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,630
the whole neighborhood smells like a

593
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,790
dead skin but on the line for two weeks

594
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,860
it'll smell like that but week three all

595
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,409
of a sudden the terpenes vaporize are

596
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:09,519
they something a torch

597
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,950
and it doesn't it doesn't hold so I

598
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,509
don't know I know you know people

599
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,850
reminisce about that light green golf

600
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:17,769
ball super killing you smell through

601
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:21,909
your pocket and those strains do exist

602
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:24,039
but I don't know I mean I'm hoping to

603
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,470
have something close by the end of the

604
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:28,029
summer but you know I'm not on time I

605
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,759
don't like here I'm just more of a fun

606
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:33,430
thing but it's it's difficult you know

607
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:35,950
but cannabis puts out every imaginable

608
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,930
smell you can think of it somehow you

609
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,470
can get it to create that from onions to

610
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,210
passionflower to like fruit loops it's

611
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,069
there and you can bring it out and I

612
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,400
think it's just I think really it's a

613
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:50,200
combination of maybe some kind of

614
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,340
Colombian Afghani or maybe even like a

615
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:57,460
some kind of really oil cannae like

616
00:22:53,339 --> 00:23:01,179
motor oil kind of Afghani sativa mixed

617
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,690
with a with the kind of some kind of

618
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,610
grueling acrid low low I don't know it's

619
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,779
it's there I think people can find it

620
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:09,759
and I think people will and I think

621
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,980
people whether they created or someone

622
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,140
digs it out of their trunk I think it's

623
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,690
still out there I think it's just it

624
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,990
just was kind of selected against in in

625
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,730
the 80s and 90s and you know mid 90s is

626
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,289
when all the fruity stuff came in all

627
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,480
the bubble gums and blueberries and all

628
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:27,339
that funny gross stuff it kind of went

629
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,150
by the wayside everybody wanted the kind

630
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:33,549
of you know all the groovy fruity bubbly

631
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:37,120
stuff and that even put the nail and

632
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:39,940
coffin even deeper for it so what's your

633
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,699
favorite flavor of cannabis I don't know

634
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:46,000
you know I I really like effects but if

635
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,789
I had to have a flavor you know I do

636
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,500
like that really bright lemon pine-sol

637
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,659
of OG I like the mouth I like the stuff

638
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,380
you can taste but you know if I had to

639
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,400
really pin it down I like the really

640
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:03,670
like deep roasted kind of Bubba spice

641
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,290
kind of baked goods and sweets and and

642
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,480
then I like they're really feminine like

643
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:10,629
she must like the stuff that's just kind

644
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:14,230
of really engages your neurons like

645
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:16,630
makes you like stuff that you would like

646
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:19,149
sexy smells I like that and then I like

647
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,589
crazy we are like the I'm also trying to

648
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:22,868
you know I make a lot of weird stuff I

649
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:26,979
make a lot of onion and I make a lot of

650
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:28,418
like pirate sweat and a lot of I try to

651
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:30,338
make a really weird smells I have like a

652
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:32,409
garlic pickle like I'm making all these

653
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:34,898
really weird lines that no one I'm sure

654
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:36,759
we'll ever want to smell or smoke in

655
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:38,319
this kind of roadkill project so then

656
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:40,690
we're going but you know I'm just like

657
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,628
extremes so I have a Hawaiian that I

658
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,669
love it smells like gardenias and it has

659
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:49,658
a really unique effect but I think spice

660
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:54,669
spices my favorite spice and really

661
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:56,679
bright fruit and so what's the most

662
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:59,229
medicinal strain you've ever had for

663
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,659
yourself and do you feel that you know

664
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:03,848
the quote the most medicinal strain is

665
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:05,889
going to vary from person to person or

666
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:07,989
do you think that much like we do have

667
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:10,178
strains that you know broadly treat

668
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:12,098
certain conditions it's very likely that

669
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:13,719
you know maybe the strain you personally

670
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:15,158
like the most I might as well because if

671
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:18,308
it speaks to you it possibly speaks to

672
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,619
me as well yeah I think it comes down to

673
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,479
you know our definitely certain strains

674
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:23,829
are more specific for certain things but

675
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:28,119
it comes down I think to body chemistry

676
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:30,069
and and in your own endocannabinoid

677
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:31,898
system I mean I thought I've even heard

678
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:33,968
like whoa I was a Rafael mushy lamb he

679
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:36,699
was saying that he even believes that

680
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:38,950
the endocannabinoid system is in part

681
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,859
responsible for our own personalities

682
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,719
like how we are as humans and how we are

683
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:45,218
as people because our you know it's like

684
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:47,349
a fingerprint everybody's in Oklahoma

685
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:49,239
system is slightly different in the way

686
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:51,098
it interacts with itself and then

687
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:53,588
interacts with cannabis itself and it

688
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:56,798
can almost lend to make us who we are as

689
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:58,269
humans and so I think you know it's kind

690
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,608
of like those people I know people that

691
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:01,989
smoke like our super racy sativa and

692
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:03,638
they go to sleep and then there's the

693
00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:08,169
people that smoking indica and they want

694
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:09,788
to do like a triathlon so you know when

695
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:13,019
it comes to CBD rich stuff and stuff you

696
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:15,429
know it's pretty you know you're pretty

697
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,048
you know what's gonna happen but I don't

698
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,989
know I I think it's really comes down to

699
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:21,969
personal chemistry and finding what

700
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:23,739
really works for you you know and and

701
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:24,999
also what fine people really need to

702
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:26,229
communicate I think there should be I

703
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,969
don't know why there's on a website

704
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:29,919
I mean sure I'm sure there is where

705
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:31,230
people are logging that have serious

706
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,840
illnesses and did

707
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,120
illnesses logging down what strains work

708
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,519
for them for certain things like lupus

709
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:42,089
or MS or like really I would love to see

710
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,888
a strain directory for people that have

711
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,808
honestly have things that are going on

712
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:47,538
and really be able to correlate those

713
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:50,579
two

714
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:52,619
for some people it's you know necessary

715
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:55,349
just due to the sheer amount of kind of

716
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:58,109
Canterbury's need to ingest but do you

717
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:59,908
think the idea of making concentrates I

718
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:02,729
guess specifically in the context of say

719
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,980
dabs or you know those types of solvents

720
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,630
or solvent extractions which are going

721
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,069
to be ideally theoretically used through

722
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,070
like a dab rig so we're not talking

723
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:12,808
about like you know RSO caps or whatever

724
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:15,509
so we're talking about that do you feel

725
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:17,730
that you while maybe some people gain a

726
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:21,240
certain sense of medicinal value out of

727
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,159
it you're also losing a certain amount

728
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,929
of ability to use the plan in a

729
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,970
spiritual way and I guess the way the

730
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:28,350
reason why I say this is because I'm not

731
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,610
an overly spiritual person but I mean

732
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:32,519
there's certainly times when I've had

733
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:33,869
cannabis it felt those types of effects

734
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,669
however I've never had such an

735
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,288
experience with dabs admittedly I'm not

736
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:39,028
a huge diver but you know what I mean do

737
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:41,819
you feel it's the same like you're

738
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:44,759
almost losing your link to the plant in

739
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:47,759
a way when you do that yeah I wonder I

740
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:50,308
mean I used to same thing I'm always

741
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,960
like getting reeducate idli I used to

742
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:53,190
kind of look down on concentrates and

743
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,079
down like I know that's just like a

744
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,100
bunch of crackheads it's like you know

745
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,750
it's like plant of the Apes and monkeys

746
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,969
always trying to push it further you

747
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,099
know and then I was like and then I saw

748
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,929
people like in Colorado as it started

749
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:06,808
catching on and people like green dot

750
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:08,340
and all these people like really like

751
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:10,079
honing their art and I was realized oh

752
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:12,178
my god this is like this is people

753
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,069
basically doing an alchemical process

754
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,710
this is kind of like modern cannabis

755
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:19,710
alchemy of taking the vital essence and

756
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,769
spirits and terpenes and and volatiles

757
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,509
and concentrating them and I think it's

758
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,730
you know for people that have serious

759
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:30,240
illness a DAB is kind of like the only

760
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,399
thing that's going to really get enough

761
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,069
get enough active constituents into

762
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,379
their system to really find the relief

763
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:38,788
and I I find it I don't know I find the

764
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,440
whole deaf culture like fascinating I

765
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:44,829
love how it goes hand in hand with glass

766
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:48,100
and art and it's it's a really unique

767
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:51,159
like genre and it baffles me I you know

768
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:54,009
I don't do dabs I would probably like

769
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,550
explode like I'm so hypersensitive I

770
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:59,680
think I would just lose it on a dab and

771
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:01,210
and you know I've smoked hash here and

772
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,060
there and that you know that's pretty

773
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:07,569
good but maybe I should try it but I

774
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:09,789
don't think it's really for my system

775
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:13,599
but for people that enjoy and people

776
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:15,460
that have you know maybe smoke so much

777
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,529
that that's the next logical step

778
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,079
I like that people are being creative

779
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:23,259
and at least if they have to go that far

780
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,519
to really make it unique and special and

781
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:25,809
really push each other I kind of like

782
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,529
how people are always trying to come up

783
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:31,269
with the most most turkey and most this

784
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:34,240
and most that and try and capture all

785
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,769
the volatiles and and and I also you

786
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,539
know I like I don't know I think it's

787
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:40,000
just it's a unique thing and unto itself

788
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,680
and I don't judge and I really like how

789
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,410
passionate people are about it but I

790
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,500
mean personally I don't think it's kind

791
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,750
of the way to go for the majority of

792
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,069
people and I think it probably people

793
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,980
that don't understand it kind of looked

794
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:55,119
down on it but it is it's amazing and

795
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,559
even the people some of the people I

796
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,629
respect the most love it and I'm like

797
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,319
that is awesome I think that is so cool

798
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,810
and I love so it's a cool thing but not

799
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,579
my thing but it is unique and it does

800
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:08,049
have medical application but even the

801
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:10,029
recreational applications even though

802
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,919
they can seem excessive and and

803
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:14,170
sometimes you know I've seen people with

804
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,789
the cups take a DAB and like you know

805
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,110
fall backwards land on their head it's

806
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,059
like I think it comes down to being

807
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:21,939
responsible and people having the

808
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:24,399
intelligence to to utilize these really

809
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,190
potent cannabis concentrations in

810
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,840
amazing ways and I think you know you

811
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,130
could probably have a pretty I think it

812
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:31,209
would be like a bungee jump into the

813
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,650
void I'm sure you could probably have a

814
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,190
kind of a spiritual experience with the

815
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,750
dab if you once you're like what I don't

816
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,090
know enough about it I mean the effects

817
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:42,549
I I never taken a DAB I feel like a dork

818
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:45,279
for saying that but I just know what

819
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:49,180
would happen and you've never done a

820
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:51,069
little sneaky red-hot knife in the 90s I

821
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,090
know and everybody makes fun of me it's

822
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:53,230
like you know take it down Mary was

823
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:55,359
trying to give me a DAB and I like you

824
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,740
know it's usually at a cup or something

825
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,399
and that's like the last place I would

826
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,589
ever

827
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,350
out get a men's TV while you're at it

828
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:04,089
yeah people have given me amazing

829
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:07,599
concentrates and people do incredible

830
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:09,879
jobs and I love how you know and you

831
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,259
know the highest grade BAM he lives he's

832
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,120
in the area and he gives me his pen

833
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:14,259
sometimes those are so flavorable

834
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,609
they're so fun and they're so awesome

835
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:17,799
and they have a good spare we taking

836
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:19,500
them traveling and that's you know

837
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,059
that's kind of about as far as I go with

838
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,000
concentrates I like a little ash but

839
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:26,799
yeah I don't know I think I would just a

840
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,599
DAB but I would need to be in a

841
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,210
meditative spy would need to be in my

842
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,279
dome like ready they're getting there in

843
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,569
the lotus position ready to just shoot

844
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,670
into the void because that's way too

845
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:42,039
much cannabinoids for my system

846
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:44,170
bordering DMT for you yeah it is it's

847
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:47,200
like a cannabis DMT and a gung-ho I

848
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:50,289
honor all the people that can have the

849
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,509
that can do dabs with intelligence and

850
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:55,799
passion I think you guys are awesome

851
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:58,329
your likes your like space command house

852
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,710
so yeah go for it if you're passionate

853
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:03,220
and you do a good job and you make a

854
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,840
quality product then more power to you

855
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,160
and more power to everybody these into

856
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,019
it all the glass artists and all the

857
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,850
festivals like chalice that's like a dab

858
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:12,789
festival how crazy is that that's

859
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:15,129
amazing like this yeah cannabis and the

860
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:17,920
whole community constantly blows my mind

861
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,260
so I just try and I try and don't judge

862
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,950
and just sit back and enjoy the ride

863
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:26,200
that we're having cuz it sure is wild

864
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:28,299
yeah I mean certainly used to be a lot

865
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,860
more auntie dads and I am now but I

866
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:31,659
think the thing which I say about it

867
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:35,619
which i think is going to be really hard

868
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,750
to make it not problematic is a you know

869
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,149
the visual act of watching someone take

870
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,519
a DAB is quite a kin to some other

871
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,230
harder drugs so that's always gonna be a

872
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,329
hill to overcome but the other thing is

873
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,130
I find a lot of people just blow their

874
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:49,569
tolerance out of the water and then they

875
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,100
really struggle to enjoy flowers

876
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:53,889
afterwards and I think that's something

877
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:56,019
you've got to be super mindful of yeah

878
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,790
no of course I mean yeah I mean it's

879
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:59,589
like that with at that point it'd be

880
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:01,690
kind of comes you know it really come

881
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:03,099
becomes a drug because yeah you're

882
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,200
you're pushing yourself so far

883
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:07,589
bludgeoning your cannabinoid system so

884
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,990
hard that yeah you're creating a pretty

885
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:12,480
pretty intense tolerance

886
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,089
yeah oh well to get under something

887
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,048
maybe a little more lighthearted

888
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:18,178
what was the biggest disappointment

889
00:33:16,048 --> 00:33:20,730
you've ever had in regards to popping

890
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,350
seeds and was it popping some landrace

891
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,669
seeds that you had high hopes for and

892
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:25,918
they just turned out to be duds or was

893
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:29,820
it in fact a line you made and likewise

894
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,759
you turned out to be a dud um I made

895
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:35,069
some deadlines for sure I made some yeah

896
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:37,169
I wonder what's the worst I used to kind

897
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:39,418
of remember I used to got it I had some

898
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:41,120
lines that from other I used to pop a

899
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,710
lot more seeds from other people like

900
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,869
some of the big companies and I've been

901
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,308
let down a couple of times

902
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:49,739
it's like I don't want to say any names

903
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:51,148
or anything but there was a while where

904
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,849
it seemed like people weren't putting

905
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:56,849
out that quality of stuff or people were

906
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:59,699
just pushing stuff out too fast or you

907
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:04,859
know or I don't know it but hmm

908
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:08,280
something that's disappointing me you

909
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:10,168
know I try to respect every plant I take

910
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,119
into my lungs you know and all even

911
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:14,368
weird stuff like my philosophy is

912
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,409
usually it's the worst lurking bud that

913
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,358
has the best effect you know it's

914
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,579
usually a scraggly piece of weird thing

915
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:21,989
that barely then I always find it funny

916
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,358
because I'm Instagram I'll post some of

917
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:27,299
the sativa pictures and they'll be like

918
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:29,250
learn how to grow or what is that swag

919
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,720
or was that you know like people and

920
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,780
like they don't get like this is like

921
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,189
such a like a rare like special

922
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,619
Rajasthani plant that I got from a Baba

923
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,710
who's like had it in his like song a

924
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:42,599
crew of just bought Saudis for like eons

925
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,190
and that's their special string if you

926
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,639
don't realize that like some of these

927
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:50,190
things that look funny they they are

928
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,559
they have the most amazing effect so you

929
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:55,980
know these days I try I give everything

930
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,289
a chance I mean my most I guess the

931
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,608
disappointments would be smoking

932
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:02,730
something that someone gave me that

933
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:05,969
there obviously was wasn't grown

934
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:08,338
correctly or had had lots of problems or

935
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:10,139
really gross stuff on it or grown with

936
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:13,230
it you know I mean it's just it's I

937
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:15,269
think it's the my most sad times when

938
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:20,280
people don't respect the plant and still

939
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:23,159
produce the product yeah so have you

940
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,550
ever had any seeds confiscated on the

941
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,789
way back

942
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:29,070
or maybe the alternative question is do

943
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:32,250
you sense its back my mouth or you take

944
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:35,730
it a little more L risky I used to

945
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:38,489
always I actually have been busted at at

946
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,110
the airport and it was kind of funny and

947
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:41,909
synchronous ting stuff but it scared the

948
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,680
hell out of everybody and my wife was

949
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:45,210
waiting outside with our kids like for

950
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,899
hours while they had me in the like

951
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:52,260
strip-searched room but one of my what

952
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,240
am i nepali himalayan kind of like when

953
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,550
i was collecting seeds there they had

954
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,519
collected like 15 lines and I had them

955
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:02,580
all marked and I had them all in bags

956
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,250
and I couldn't find this one bag and I

957
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,509
was like you know I hit him pretty good

958
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,639
and I couldn't figure out where the hell

959
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,380
I put it and didn't know where it is and

960
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,960
you know I have secret secret ways of

961
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,970
doing it and you know of course they

962
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,679
pulled me into the secondary and they're

963
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:18,359
digging through all my stuff and then in

964
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,039
my toiletries they find this bag of

965
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,930
seeds and they're like what's this and

966
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:24,929
I'm like oh it's a snack and they're

967
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,219
like oh it looks like you know cannabis

968
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:28,049
I'm like oh it's probably attempt seeds

969
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,329
they eat doesn't Nepal and they're like

970
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,830
and like so they call the guy over it

971
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:33,779
brings a little kit and they fill it

972
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:36,269
sees in there and they shake it and it

973
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,100
turns purple and all of a sudden it was

974
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:39,960
like all hell breaks loose the guy

975
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,579
freaks out and grabs we think he locks

976
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,289
down he hits a button and they're like

977
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,730
oh my god he's like you know and

978
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:46,710
everybody scurrying screaming like dude

979
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,710
it's just he sees like I guess it came

980
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,880
up positive so the first guy comes

981
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,380
through and he's like stand there and

982
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,750
he's like yeah you know he starts going

983
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,860
through all my stuff and he goes through

984
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,079
he's going through he's going through he

985
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,269
almost gets to my stash of all my seeds

986
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,159
and I brought over you know and then the

987
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:04,110
next tire up guy comes up and he's like

988
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,639
let me look through this and he starts

989
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,250
over any doesn't he does he does he

990
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,809
almost gets there you know the next guy

991
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,039
comes up the higher up and now they've

992
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:13,019
you know I've all these guys around me

993
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,210
and they're really freaking out and then

994
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:18,000
finally he is looking through everything

995
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,650
he's just about to find it in the head

996
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,119
honcho comes up and he's like did you

997
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,349
sir did you search all this bags and I

998
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,789
get all they're like they're all it's

999
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:26,670
sketch they're like yes sir yes sir

1000
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:27,840
and so you know they put my bag down and

1001
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,490
they sent me and they did the strip

1002
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,050
search and all that and they kind of you

1003
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:33,419
know they were you saying they're gonna

1004
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,430
[ __ ] send me to agriculture and find me

1005
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,930
and they were you know threatening me

1006
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:38,940
and doing all these things

1007
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:41,308
it was pretty sad but this craziest

1008
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,220
thing is they never got to those seeds

1009
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:46,619
so I lost 1 pack but I brought back like

1010
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:49,799
15 and it scared the hell out of

1011
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:52,200
everybody and now I have more stealthy

1012
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,210
ways I do it and you know I'm not gonna

1013
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:56,578
say if I bring them on my person or send

1014
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,829
them or anything just in case those

1015
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:01,800
special humans that one of us we are

1016
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:03,990
listening no I don't have seeds on me I

1017
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,140
don't do anything crazy like that they

1018
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:10,799
just magically get back to America yeah

1019
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:13,139
that's how it should be yeah it's a very

1020
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,339
real danger and people you know I say

1021
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:16,078
say you know I do both

1022
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:19,578
I say send'em get some of that

1023
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,440
corrugated plastic that they use for

1024
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:23,730
signs for when the local like City

1025
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,929
Council they put those signs up

1026
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,400
everywhere they're usually printed on

1027
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:28,919
this corrugated plastic that'd make a

1028
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,838
great seed shipper and you just put that

1029
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,490
in envelope and send it back home

1030
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,699
usually do to send it from different

1031
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:37,379
places and you definitely get one I mean

1032
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:39,088
when I sent my seeds back from Morocco

1033
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,220
I sent them in to different post-office

1034
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:44,039
I only got one but at least I got one

1035
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:45,629
you know I put the same seeds in each

1036
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,460
one knowing that one board probably one

1037
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,440
they should so where there's a will

1038
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,269
there's a way and you know you just have

1039
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,030
to be stealthy and tricky and just cover

1040
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:56,608
all your bases sadly I have experienced

1041
00:38:54,030 --> 00:39:00,359
that I too did the two packages and I I

1042
00:38:56,608 --> 00:39:02,848
lost the seeds you gave me oh well I'm

1043
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:06,509
sure can figure out a way to magically

1044
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:11,338
get them somewhere near where you are we

1045
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:13,319
have the technology so the follow-up

1046
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:14,759
question that was maybe a bit of a hairy

1047
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,179
situation you found yourself in the

1048
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,309
States

1049
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:18,960
how about even worse in the other

1050
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:20,910
countries you know what's the hairiest

1051
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,519
moment you've been in a foreign country

1052
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:25,529
oh my gosh I've been a lot of like

1053
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,269
life-threatening things but for like

1054
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,640
actual like getting busted kind of

1055
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:32,219
things no just on vu rank to be the most

1056
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:37,469
kind of intense or you know scariest so

1057
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:39,568
to speak I mean we think I think that's

1058
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:42,000
the Spry the scariest is when I was

1059
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:45,088
collecting seeds in Nepal during still

1060
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,818
during their Civil War it was the MAOIs

1061
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:49,980
against the you know the ruling powers I

1062
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:54,269
think that was in the early 2000

1063
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:56,338
and I was thinking a bus to poco and we

1064
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,659
had a convoy because there was you know

1065
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:59,070
they still had a lot of problems so they

1066
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:03,480
would send a military convoy with the

1067
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:07,500
bus and the convoy in front of us got

1068
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,510
blown up by the Maoist so they blew up

1069
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,300
the car in front of us that was about

1070
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,500
this may be the craziest thing ever but

1071
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,310
you know I've always been in dangerous

1072
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,739
situations via like you know almost

1073
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:24,358
drowned once in this crazy boat in

1074
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:26,279
Belize on the way over to Livingston I'm

1075
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,210
trying to think what else you know even

1076
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:34,410
just being in Belize and in that early

1077
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:36,449
90s was super sketchy Morocco Rhonda's

1078
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:39,088
not my favorite place they people really

1079
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:40,858
just the mountain people are beautiful

1080
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:42,869
but it seems whenever I was in like

1081
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:46,259
towns I was always being swindled or

1082
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:48,269
mugged or people just weren't I don't

1083
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,609
know I'm not a big fan of Morocco but um

1084
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:53,579
I don't know you know maybe four

1085
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:58,250
actually busting cannabis type thing I

1086
00:40:53,579 --> 00:41:02,700
was in China and I had my pen with me

1087
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:04,829
and they sent me through the x-ray and

1088
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:06,629
it kept on popping up and actually like

1089
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,760
what's this metal thing and I was like

1090
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,289
oh my god if you know China is like your

1091
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,490
death I don't think it's destined and

1092
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:16,019
but you go to jail forever and sunny

1093
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,088
it's all about the synchrony seeing the

1094
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:19,710
magic the same thing wouldn't pushed it

1095
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:21,869
through twice push it through twice and

1096
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,608
then it and they couldn't find it for

1097
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:25,530
some reason they couldn't find it and

1098
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:27,358
finally when it came through again I

1099
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,800
kind of like they were lucky and I kind

1100
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,299
of pulled it out and they went it

1101
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,550
through one more time and like it didn't

1102
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,318
show up I go whatever then they sent me

1103
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,210
through but I was like oh my god what's

1104
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,739
gonna happen to it especially yeah you

1105
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,210
know I'm like oh it's like a e-cig or

1106
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:40,649
something and you know knowing in China

1107
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:43,559
they don't want to try it so I'm like

1108
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,119
okay I have five minutes for the effects

1109
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:46,650
to kick in to get all the way across the

1110
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,210
airport and into my next plane by the

1111
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,670
time they figure out kind of what's

1112
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:53,250
going on but magically I made it through

1113
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,690
you know there there's always things but

1114
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,440
hopefully you know hopefully that's the

1115
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,780
thing in the past

1116
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,550
I just want cannabis to be part of the

1117
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,079
world again you know it was basically

1118
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:04,339
our our most utilized plant source from

1119
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,349
I mean Memorial was our very first

1120
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:09,199
cultivated plant I mean it's been with

1121
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:12,619
us for hundreds of thousands of years

1122
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:15,228
it's like our it's so it follows my mind

1123
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:17,329
that it's not part of our heritage it's

1124
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:18,528
not you know he's Jordan washing is used

1125
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,880
to smoke it was his favorite thing to

1126
00:42:18,528 --> 00:42:21,588
sit on the back porch and smoke some

1127
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,630
hemp and you were supposed to grow I

1128
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:25,099
mean they it was a law you as a farmer

1129
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,979
you had to grow it like what happened

1130
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:30,859
it's like it really it really boggles my

1131
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:32,419
mind that that were that were in this

1132
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:37,518
predicament and I'm really glad that

1133
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:39,680
we're coming out of it sure so to the

1134
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:41,149
last section we've got I shouldn't say

1135
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,919
last section second last section the

1136
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,838
last section is just some really quick

1137
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,068
answers but second last section we've

1138
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:49,338
got all the questions submitted by

1139
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:51,798
people who wanted to find out the inside

1140
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:53,078
scoop on mostly strains they're growing

1141
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:56,478
but let's start banging through them

1142
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,160
okay so this one go

1143
00:42:56,478 --> 00:43:04,068
top five traits you look for in a good

1144
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:08,949
male uniqueness resinous male like if

1145
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:11,150
you push it far enough lower structure

1146
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:13,699
really I think the uniqueness thing

1147
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,499
comes in to the like is just cultivating

1148
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:17,568
awareness with cannabis and really

1149
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:18,919
getting to know it so that you can kind

1150
00:43:17,568 --> 00:43:20,389
of connect with your heart with it

1151
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,119
because you know plants have an

1152
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:24,318
electromagnetic field and if you can

1153
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:25,818
your heart is an electromagnetic field

1154
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,558
and if you press if you can kind of do

1155
00:43:25,818 --> 00:43:29,150
that that's where you can kind of it's

1156
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:30,859
this sixth sense of kind of reading

1157
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,900
where you just know something is special

1158
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:36,978
but definitely I think first and

1159
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,680
foremost resinous males and structure

1160
00:43:36,978 --> 00:43:41,858
and stability and you know stem rubbing

1161
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:45,558
is great I always encourage people to

1162
00:43:41,858 --> 00:43:48,078
stem rub before sex and after because

1163
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:51,079
the smells do change you know and also

1164
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,759
also smell rub on the collar like up by

1165
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:56,059
the top and also down below you'll get a

1166
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:58,068
different you get different smells you

1167
00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:59,809
know if you're breeding for color that's

1168
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:02,478
pretty obvious just find the best

1169
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:06,619
structured best stable purple male if

1170
00:44:02,478 --> 00:44:09,649
you're you know going for purple let's

1171
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:13,150
see if you're doing for for smell it's

1172
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:15,539
gonna be resinous males ProjectWise

1173
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,430
it's just testing your females

1174
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:20,130
and you're out crosses and further F

1175
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:22,619
ones I mean it's it's really it's really

1176
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,660
just kind of checking all your bases

1177
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,429
doing the best you can with your senses

1178
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:27,719
and then you know that proofs in the

1179
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:29,789
pudding the best way to know if you're

1180
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,179
doing a good job let's grow them out see

1181
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:35,730
how it did see what's going on test it

1182
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:37,529
testing that's a whole kind of strange

1183
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,449
thing these days I noticed back when I

1184
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,980
started if you didn't test you'd get a

1185
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:43,619
run out of town and it seems like the

1186
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,289
norm now is nobody test and even a lot

1187
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,420
of the breeders that used to be so super

1188
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:50,610
into testing have kind of bonnet gone by

1189
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,010
the wayside too it's almost like it's

1190
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:55,829
people want things so fast and so new

1191
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:58,590
that they're willing to just risk it and

1192
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:59,759
and it's kind of like people that may be

1193
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:02,340
tested before don't want to be left

1194
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,430
alone behind but I think testing is a is

1195
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,840
an important part of not necessarily

1196
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:08,519
gifting but if you're gonna VIN

1197
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,660
something you want to make sure that it

1198
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:15,019
it's stable and it has all the desirable

1199
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:18,210
features that you originally wanted to

1200
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:21,000
put into it so I would say people cool

1201
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:24,000
you should test your stuff more please

1202
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,780
so I mean a question which tends to mind

1203
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,909
from that is I heard from a few breeders

1204
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,290
that maybe they weren't being a hundred

1205
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:32,940
percent serious but I get the inkling

1206
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:35,789
that they were when they say things like

1207
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,710
the demand for certain and safe flavors

1208
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:39,090
of the mom thought for new stock is so

1209
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,769
high that they almost feel like they

1210
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,960
don't have time to test all as you said

1211
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:44,639
they will get left behind do you think

1212
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,929
there is room in the current market for

1213
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:47,369
people to be able to test and stay

1214
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:50,460
relevant or do you think that the time

1215
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:52,469
lapse between creating a strain testing

1216
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,360
it getting it to market is going to kind

1217
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:57,989
of start to be problematic in today's

1218
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,750
market I think for new breeders I think

1219
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:02,129
there's like a impetus or a push like

1220
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,750
they just want to get it out it's like

1221
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,640
they don't have the time or they don't

1222
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,349
have the back history or they don't have

1223
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:09,389
the things and they just want to get

1224
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:11,099
their stuff out quick but you know I

1225
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:13,199
mean that's a short it's short sighted

1226
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,420
and maybe you'll get maybe everybody

1227
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,099
will be super stoked and hype up your

1228
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,230
strain and you'll you know you become a

1229
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:21,089
new breeder but it's not sustainable

1230
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:24,960
like then what happens when you're

1231
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:29,250
trying to do new stuff I mean yeah I

1232
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,139
really think that it's part of it and

1233
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,570
you know I mean another way to do it is

1234
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:35,190
to is if you do find your niche you

1235
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,809
don't have to deal with the strain of

1236
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,610
the week you're kind of creating your

1237
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:40,860
own new thing and people appreciate that

1238
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,870
for and another thing is is really fine

1239
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,559
what you think is gonna be the next big

1240
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:48,179
thing and maybe I try and kind of

1241
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,460
imagine what's gonna be big in the

1242
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:52,079
future and kind of you know I try and

1243
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,530
play a long game I kind of make stuff

1244
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,059
I'll start about a year behind of my

1245
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,040
projects and kind of think okay what

1246
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:00,719
where is things going like what are

1247
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,429
people into and what do you what can I

1248
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,339
bring to the table that might be unique

1249
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:06,719
and special but also utilize what people

1250
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,400
are really into and kind of go from

1251
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,789
there you know like the last a lot of my

1252
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,309
newer males are more focused on chirps

1253
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:16,579
and resin where some of the old ones

1254
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:19,019
like you know snow Lotus was more about

1255
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:20,789
bringing a sativa touch to everything

1256
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:23,400
and bringing like a hardiness and the

1257
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:26,779
appellation was kind of bringing in the

1258
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,309
chem line in a different way and really

1259
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,710
adding a special spice of things and you

1260
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:33,449
know g13 hash plant was kind of to allow

1261
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:37,829
to turn things into a hash belt like a

1262
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:40,619
proper heavy-duty powerful strain I

1263
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:42,599
think it's really I think you can get

1264
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,150
out of the whole mindset of trying to

1265
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,339
push things so fast so out so quick by

1266
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:49,410
just tuning into yourself and really

1267
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:52,880
also looking into the future and also

1268
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:55,159
finding your niche and finding you know

1269
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,329
yeah without a doubt

1270
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:59,369
you mentioned the snow Lotus line

1271
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:03,829
possibly one of your more well-known

1272
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:06,539
ones alongside the sunshine daydream and

1273
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:09,840
gosh forgetting the name and made the

1274
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:12,000
other one oh yeah Appalachia and then

1275
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,710
there's a g13 hash plant and then some

1276
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,150
random one sorry just the earliest

1277
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,050
trains we mentioned they're the ones

1278
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,780
that I thought were you to trademark

1279
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:21,240
sunshine daydream and maybe it was snow

1280
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,830
Lotus anyway long story short in terms

1281
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,209
of the information you find online about

1282
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:25,500
it it's an interesting one because it

1283
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,030
seems like you know there's little to

1284
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,530
birds of information here and there the

1285
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,630
thing which kind of consistently comes

1286
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,730
up is it says you know it's blockade

1287
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:35,280
cross off GUI and there's no sweet tooth

1288
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:36,210
traits present what can you tell us more

1289
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,890
about it you know what was it

1290
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,150
specifically bringing to the table

1291
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:41,069
because I mean it's obvious from looking

1292
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,930
at the crosses it was a good model but

1293
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:45,240
it's kind of hard

1294
00:48:42,929 --> 00:48:47,909
extrapolate what traits it was bringing

1295
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:51,389
given the somewhat the somewhat vague

1296
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:54,029
description yeah it was a wild one it

1297
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:55,469
was one of those strain as a male it was

1298
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,170
one of those ones that kind of like just

1299
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:59,789
communicated to me like I just knew and

1300
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,068
I kind of saw it and it you know it has

1301
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:03,779
this unique trait of having that purp

1302
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:06,000
you know follows through in a lot of its

1303
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,670
hybrids it has this really purple stalk

1304
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,309
thing that goes on well it Purple's up

1305
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,869
at stalks and I don't know it literally

1306
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:14,220
got it was one of those things kind of

1307
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,230
like a heart breeding thing where I just

1308
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:18,480
kind of connected with it and I felt it

1309
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:20,880
and I was like oh this thing is special

1310
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,349
and then you know I out crossed it to

1311
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,619
like Bubba and a couple things that I

1312
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:28,019
know how things kind of come out with it

1313
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:29,970
and you know and I noticed it was really

1314
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:32,550
allowing all the best rates to come

1315
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:35,759
through of that parent mother clone and

1316
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:38,839
then beefing up like a lot of that

1317
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:42,240
potency in frost and the structure and

1318
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:45,389
yeah it was a really old the male was a

1319
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,848
really old blockhead and then it was

1320
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:50,699
kind of mixed with our kind of classic

1321
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:52,890
late 90s early 2000s F goo that a lot of

1322
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:55,409
people grew you know there's every every

1323
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,608
town in city and environ has these kind

1324
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,199
of like special clones that everybody

1325
00:49:56,608 --> 00:50:01,980
kind of grew back then like back then we

1326
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:03,118
had like s15 and banana and ask you and

1327
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,179
all these you know

1328
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,710
colognes and ask you was was a really

1329
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:09,750
amazing like kind of Hawaiian haze

1330
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:12,838
Afghani but it kind of leaned more to

1331
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,159
the Afghani and it had it did it didn't

1332
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:17,250
smell so great it was kind of like a

1333
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:19,440
muted kind of berry ish but the effect

1334
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:22,048
and the resin content was just like off

1335
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,519
the charts and so it makes it makes a I

1336
00:50:22,048 --> 00:50:25,639
think it's a really underrated plant I

1337
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:29,548
think it makes a great breeding plant

1338
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:31,769
and then that that p19 or product 19 or

1339
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:34,500
whatever the block head it had a little

1340
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:38,159
sativa and it had whatever it was was a

1341
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:40,380
call forgot exactly but it was well it

1342
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:44,548
has it doesn't it's sweet tooth and then

1343
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,880
like pea product 1990 no wasn't it from

1344
00:50:44,548 --> 00:50:49,289
that was a Yaqui or whatever was one of

1345
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,210
reader Steve's friends gave him this

1346
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:52,679
crazy sativa and that was the cross and

1347
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,750
it called it blockhead because I made

1348
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,019
these really kooky flat tops and it was

1349
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:58,840
really strong and

1350
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:00,730
and that mail didn't really have too

1351
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,210
much sweet tooth going on like it really

1352
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:06,840
kind of captured that kind of really

1353
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:09,309
exotic and powerful and like virile

1354
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,050
sativa aspect of it so that combined

1355
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:13,269
with African just made this really

1356
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:16,930
unique and special plant and what

1357
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:19,619
surprised me with it was it was so like

1358
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:23,169
clear and breeding like it would just

1359
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:24,819
lightly put its own kind of magic into

1360
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,610
crosses it would kind of just beef up

1361
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:29,350
whatever cross but allowed a lot of the

1362
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,390
smells you know sometimes in certain

1363
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:34,360
crosses that were probably super multi

1364
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:35,619
poly hybrids it would this snow Lotus

1365
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,059
would kind of pop through and you would

1366
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:39,639
get that kind of muted kind of berry

1367
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:42,279
then even in the you know in like the

1368
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:45,009
goji og you get you you know you get the

1369
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,140
berry of the snow Lotus but you get the

1370
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:48,790
you get that lemon pine-sol of the OG

1371
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:51,489
and it was kind of this perfect balance

1372
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:53,980
and that you know I tried many different

1373
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:56,259
oh geez originally to trying before the

1374
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,869
nepali to try and find one that really

1375
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,880
kind of had that magic but yeah that was

1376
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:02,380
just a really amazing mail and that's

1377
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,840
why I kept it for so long and that's why

1378
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:06,730
I always used it because I don't know it

1379
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,800
just it was it just spoke to me and it

1380
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,389
just did such great stuff and indoors

1381
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,960
and outdoors you know I'm not a I'm not

1382
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:15,639
a big outdoor breeder but these days I

1383
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,970
kind of am beginning it was all indoors

1384
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:21,759
you know and and it it made amazing

1385
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:24,699
indoors and outdoors so I really I

1386
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,190
really respect and loves that plant a

1387
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:29,619
lot because for what it did yeah I've

1388
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:31,900
made some hybrids with the super snow

1389
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:33,579
Lotus and the tranquilizer and I found

1390
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,590
snow that has comes through great in

1391
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:38,469
both of a minutes really nice influence

1392
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:41,110
yeah it is it's beautiful and it has in

1393
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:42,849
the snow Lotus female what was such an

1394
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:45,070
amazing beautiful plant like if you ever

1395
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:46,329
saw pictures of it grew like a Lotus it

1396
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:48,550
like it didn't grow like a normal

1397
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:50,650
cannabis it made these like weird

1398
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,600
strange beautiful flowers and it was a

1399
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,389
dark kind of like black-ish and I had a

1400
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:56,739
very like hey I caught like a heady

1401
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:59,349
indica like it definitely grew like a

1402
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:03,219
sativa but it had that deep body but

1403
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:04,690
with the really open vast mind yeah I've

1404
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:07,558
seen some photos of that one it looks

1405
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:09,809
really nice with kind of the what's

1406
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,369
would ya almost like a little bit of Fox

1407
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:13,709
tailing going on that makes it look like

1408
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:15,869
the Lotus yeah yeah yeah it's got like

1409
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:17,848
an inflorescence like yeah almost like a

1410
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:20,969
hand like a crab isn't it

1411
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:23,099
so a lot of people have commented on how

1412
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:24,659
nice that Kali Orange mount looks on

1413
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:28,318
your Instagram we're ever gonna see any

1414
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:30,659
more of that you know I I thought I kind

1415
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:32,759
of my Kelly okay got doubted which is

1416
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:34,228
sad but you know done it plants you can

1417
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:36,239
still breathe with them and it's not a

1418
00:53:34,228 --> 00:53:38,068
problem the genetics are still think so

1419
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,380
I tried to make a lot of different

1420
00:53:38,068 --> 00:53:41,969
hybrids with the Caleo before I let it

1421
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,269
go to kind of work with humming like a

1422
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:47,639
Wookiee Kelly oh and I have a lot of

1423
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:50,548
Cali OS males that I'm kind of playing

1424
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:54,058
with but you know the whole orange thing

1425
00:53:50,548 --> 00:53:56,579
it's difficult to get something super

1426
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:57,900
just that epic orange flavor and not you

1427
00:53:56,579 --> 00:54:00,028
know a lot of things have that kind of

1428
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,979
fake orange or they have that kind of a

1429
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:05,329
a lot of them most of things are like

1430
00:54:01,978 --> 00:54:08,009
that stung key Orange so entertained

1431
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:09,329
yeah so it's kind of it's one of those

1432
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:10,949
on the back burner that I play around

1433
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,298
with and I keep on mixing into other

1434
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:15,920
things it's kind of like a side project

1435
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:18,688
for my own self and I'm slowly making

1436
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,298
like an orange tool out of it you know

1437
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:22,768
I'm mixing it with different things you

1438
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:24,268
know and you know I'm right now I'm

1439
00:54:22,768 --> 00:54:26,129
trying to make a couple different inbred

1440
00:54:24,268 --> 00:54:29,368
tools like a lemon tool and an orange

1441
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:31,949
tool just so I can hit it to things and

1442
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:34,108
be like oh you want this with a little

1443
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:35,999
lemon here you go you know and same with

1444
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:38,248
the purple unicorn I got it to a point

1445
00:54:35,998 --> 00:54:40,468
now where they can take turn things

1446
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:42,448
basically anything purple and it still

1447
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:44,608
it still creates some great things and

1448
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:47,608
even now with the dragon's blood it's to

1449
00:54:44,608 --> 00:54:49,170
a point where I can cross it to other

1450
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:51,808
plants and they're all gonna have that

1451
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:54,630
blood red SAP come out like it's a

1452
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:56,880
dominant trait now at about f4 f5 it's

1453
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,798
passing that red SAP trait on to

1454
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,630
everything so I mean that's one thing

1455
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,130
about making your tools is you can you

1456
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,170
can do some cool stuff if you kind of

1457
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:07,289
just take time and make stuff to work

1458
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:11,699
with do you have a plan to work with the

1459
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:14,429
bigs holy weed again not really you know

1460
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:16,318
I don't I don't the funny thing is a lot

1461
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:18,449
of people asked I get a lot of emails

1462
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,400
and people ask for seeds and I'm I

1463
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:21,090
usually just give you know if someone's

1464
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,849
really

1465
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:25,559
about something and they really wanted I

1466
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:27,360
can't find it I'll usually dig through

1467
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,799
like I have some seconds and I'll try

1468
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,090
and find it and just give people out if

1469
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,190
they're gonna be projects and stuff but

1470
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:34,320
I don't really have those seeds left and

1471
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:36,570
I just have the one mom and it's a

1472
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,800
little bit dented and my friend that

1473
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:41,220
lives up you know

1474
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:45,120
pretty close his big things the big sir

1475
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:47,399
holy weed so I he doesn't amazing

1476
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,710
phenomenal job and so I kind of just

1477
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,900
like you are you're crushing it on this

1478
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,550
one so I'm just I'm not even kind of

1479
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,889
really go there I might maybe make some

1480
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:58,830
crosses with my my female that's left

1481
00:55:55,889 --> 00:56:00,210
but not in no plans in the in really in

1482
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:01,739
the future and you know I know there's

1483
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:04,769
packs out there and I always encourage

1484
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:06,689
people to make more seeds from the packs

1485
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:08,219
especially the Norika like you know the

1486
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,659
people I don't make a lot of Naraka

1487
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:11,429
packs because they're kind of a it's a

1488
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:12,659
pain they ask to make those seeds

1489
00:56:11,429 --> 00:56:14,129
because it's usually the super long

1490
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:16,829
flower and Stevens stuff so if you got

1491
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:18,930
any packs of Marika please make more and

1492
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:22,529
give them out to everybody you know I

1493
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:24,359
really encourage people to to make if

1494
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,010
you got rare seeds make more especially

1495
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,840
if they're mine pass them out it's like

1496
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:29,880
I you know especially if their deadlines

1497
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,980
you guys everybody can work on there's

1498
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:35,130
no restrictions on my stuff on my stuff

1499
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:39,809
I'd be as creative as you want to please

1500
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:41,519
you know okay so who is some of the

1501
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:42,840
upcoming breeders who you kind of

1502
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:46,829
keeping an eye on you know you kind of

1503
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:50,039
think they're doing some good stuff well

1504
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:51,210
you know I don't I only really get to

1505
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:55,019
interact with some of the ones I know

1506
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:56,340
personally so it's hard for me to say

1507
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:58,909
like I love seeing all the pictures and

1508
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:01,019
where people are going and and all that

1509
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:02,940
but that's a tough question you know

1510
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:04,769
like some of my friends that I that I

1511
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:07,800
know that I've seen their stuff and we

1512
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:11,480

by like doc D and J Fox and it's know hi

1514

00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:19,859
kind of interact with it on a like an on

1516

00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,710
know I really like preservation I like

1529
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:54,230
people doing a land race stuff like

1530
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:57,840
delicate doesn't I like people doing

1531
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:59,820
like like really pushing into different

1532
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,280
like extreme areas like really pushing

1533
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,990
outside of the norm those are the people

1534
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,760
that are kind of really like I like the

1535
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:08,639
whole extreme possibilities I like

1536
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,650
people doing their niche so you know for

1537
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:14,670
me it's people that are pushing things

1538
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:19,349
in new directions that's I think you

1539
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:21,750
know and I don't know who's you know who

1540
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:23,130
it's hard for me to tell what's you know

1541
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,170
like these days is like the fake news

1542
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:27,450
what's hype and what's not so until I

1543
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:29,190
really try something it's like it's hard

1544
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:31,829
to say but you know anyone that's

1545
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:33,420
passionate and that as a niche and is

1546
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:35,190
following their heart and is cool and is

1547
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,710
humble and is really just enjoying

1548
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:39,659
themselves and I think those are the

1549
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:43,170
people that are like so I don't know

1550
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:45,449
that's kind of vague but so next

1551
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:48,539
question is have you had any experience

1552
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:50,519
with the land race train known as zamel

1553
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:52,529
or you know like the Reunion Island land

1554
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:53,070
race strain because I've grown some

1555
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,660
myself

1556
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:56,490
it seemed pretty cool but more

1557
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:57,809
importantly I've heard from a lot of

1558
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:59,699
people on mind that they kind of

1559
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:01,590
consider it to be the most trippy weed

1560
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:03,269
there is so I'd be interested to know

1561
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:05,430
you know like what for you was the most

1562
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:06,869
trippy and if you've tried this a mole

1563
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:09,809
or you know anything from Reunion Island

1564
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:11,279
how did that compare well you know I

1565
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:13,559
always wanted to go to Madagascar and

1566
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,019
then to reunion to collect seeds so

1567
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:18,750
someday but you know I think a lot of

1568
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:20,579
the people that talk about that zamel as

1569
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:24,210
being like one of the most epic ones it

1570
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:27,150
was you know Garrett from what was he

1571
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:28,889
did warlock and did OCC company he's no

1572
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,780
longer with us but he had a cut his arm

1573
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:32,699
all that went around Europe and Spain

1574
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,740
that ever but everybody just raved about

1575
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:38,429
and it was like the super psychedelic

1576
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:40,979
and I've tried them all and crosses like

1577
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:43,589
in the ACE crosses and he but you know

1578
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,179
I've never got to experience my peers

1579
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,059
them all and I know that

1580
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:50,460
Sam Alito it's one of his favorites and

1581
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:53,309
I would love you know I'm always growing

1582
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,949
out weird you know crazy stuff to see

1583
00:59:53,309 --> 00:59:58,528
I'm looking for that kind of like

1584
00:59:55,949 --> 01:00:00,118
ultimate high that everybody take you

1585
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:03,000
know talks about like that super

1586
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,160
psychedelic hi and I you know I have

1587
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,920
experienced it once and Guatemala and it

1588
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:10,259
was kind of what was I always called the

1589
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,568
tomb bud but it was like I've never

1590
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:15,930
experienced anything anything like it

1591
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:17,969
since it was kind of like I don't know

1592
01:00:15,929 --> 01:00:20,879
it came on like nitrous it came on this

1593
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:23,129
weird like harmonic hum oscillating and

1594
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,858
like it basically just transformed the

1595
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:28,079
world it was almost like I don't know

1596
01:00:25,858 --> 01:00:31,769
kind of like if you're familiar it was

1597
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,420
like a family of like a Errol cyclohexyl

1598
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:36,559
means it's a kind of a psychedelic

1599
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:38,789
family like something like that or I

1600
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,798
don't know but it came on like nitrous

1601
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:42,809
and it was so soft it was you know it

1602
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,059
was like a cartoon world and me and my

1603
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:46,769
wife smoked in Guatemala you know it

1604
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:49,079
just ever since then I've been like

1605
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:50,788
chasing that and I've I've had hash in

1606
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,039
the Himalayas work you just turned

1607
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:56,069
everything into the most ecstatic joyful

1608
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,680
dream I've had flowers from this one

1609
01:00:56,068 --> 01:01:00,420
Baba in in annapurna range that I go

1610
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:02,489
visit all the time when I want to go

1611
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:05,039
back there and I don't know if it's the

1612
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:06,358
prayer he said over it or as Chilam but

1613
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:08,278
he has some pretty schwag looking

1614
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:12,480
flowers that just took me to like

1615
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:14,400
another level I've had a walk in that

1616
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,929
was so psychedelic it made me feel like

1617
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,150
I was like on the end of a mushroom or

1618
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:19,528
an ayahuasca kind of journey but it

1619
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:21,329
seems like it's always the point of

1620
01:01:19,528 --> 01:01:25,079
origin places that have those

1621
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:26,730
experiences and you know I'm I'm always

1622
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:29,609
searching I definitely have some

1623
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:32,068
psychedelic strains but nothing that

1624
01:01:29,608 --> 01:01:33,690
just completely transforms reality like

1625
01:01:32,068 --> 01:01:37,829
some of these places that have gotten at

1626
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:42,119
their point of origin yeah okay so yes I

1627
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:43,349
would love to try again Sam okay so for

1628
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:46,890
maybe a little more lighthearted

1629
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:50,180
question I'm so glad we got this is

1630
01:01:46,889 --> 01:01:52,440
pineapple illegitimate pizza topping

1631
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:54,149
yeah I mean isn't there there's like

1632
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,619
that Hawaiian pizza everybody digs I

1633
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,099
think you put whatever you want on your

1634
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:58,119
pizza

1635
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:00,880
I think it's pizzas like your own

1636
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:02,980
like mandala of vegetables and nutrition

1637
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,619
you could be as creative and expressive

1638
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:07,509
e where you want I'd like to see people

1639
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:10,539
get even more creative with pizza like

1640
01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:13,298
with crazy like Szechuan peppers and

1641
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:15,160
neat spices and maybe like fruits that

1642
01:02:13,298 --> 01:02:17,889
don't have a long shelf like like life

1643
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:21,338
like mulberries i think you know anytime

1644
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:23,199
people get creative I love it so yeah I

1645
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:24,849
think pineapple maybe people could up

1646
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,399
the game and even do something more

1647
01:02:24,849 --> 01:02:30,519
crazy than pineapple but sure pineapples

1648
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,139
cuts that takes the edge off well

1649
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:34,808
talking about pushing it to the next

1650
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:36,639
level what are your future projects in

1651
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:39,759
the pipeline not necessarily relate to

1652
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:41,588
pizza but um specifically in regards to

1653
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:44,650
males you know what's what's on the

1654
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:47,078
horizon well I'm pretty excited about

1655
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:49,900
this new Afghan email that I'm working

1656
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:52,210
with because it's it's so so what I've

1657
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,889
been you know I've grown up a million

1658
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:56,470
zillion different Afghan ease from

1659
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:59,078
modern to vintage different companies

1660
01:02:56,469 --> 01:03:00,730
and you haven't you know I get close but

1661
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:02,019
I've never got that one it's just I

1662
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:05,980
don't even know I explained it's just

1663
01:03:02,018 --> 01:03:07,328
like so acrid it's like Jamie it's not

1664
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,960
like roadkill but it's just like this

1665
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:12,130
whole other thing

1666
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:14,108
and these artifact one these old vintage

1667
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:16,690
ask an ease that I'm finally popping

1668
01:03:14,108 --> 01:03:18,518
they have that and I'm so excited and

1669
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:21,909
it's so gross and it makes me so happy

1670
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:23,798
because it's another kind of like it's

1671
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:26,259
another puzzle piece and the whole rks

1672
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:28,239
thing and I think if I you know have

1673
01:03:26,259 --> 01:03:30,369
that one Arceus line I've been working

1674
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:32,108
forever and I think if maybe maybe these

1675
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:33,970
two meet I think we might have it or

1676
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:36,248
maybe I have a some other of some

1677
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:37,659
sativas that are kind of gross that I

1678
01:03:36,248 --> 01:03:39,129
think if they if they might mean I think

1679
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:42,009
we might just have it but just all in

1680
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:44,318
all it it just has a different it's such

1681
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:45,940
a different smell and you know I always

1682
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:47,498
say if it smells different it's gonna

1683
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:48,849
have a different effect it smells good

1684
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:52,538
it's gonna have a good effect it's like

1685
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:54,369
you know I've tried to preliminary

1686
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:55,989
samples and I think it's pretty special

1687
01:03:54,369 --> 01:03:58,298
so I'm excited about that

1688
01:03:55,989 --> 01:04:01,239
I got let's see what else doing a lot of

1689
01:03:58,298 --> 01:04:04,150
the dragon's blood work to see if I can

1690
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:06,489
turn everything in my stable with red

1691
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:08,499
blood as a marker so then I can make oh

1692
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:10,150
geez that you know that when you know

1693
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:12,219
that are identifiable like

1694
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:14,170
well this one bleeds red it must be this

1695
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:17,379
you know it's a great genetic marker up

1696
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:18,818
see we got some old Williams wonder and

1697
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:23,380
popping again to see if I can make

1698
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:26,048
temple again Tiger's milk I have a lot

1699
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:30,180

old stuff some lemon and some orange e

1701
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:38,078

1702
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:40,298
do some dirty hippie line work and what

1703
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,359
else I got a backyard full of all kinds

1704
01:04:40,298 --> 01:04:43,869
of wacky stuff so you know I'm most

1705
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:45,759
excited

1706
01:04:43,869 --> 01:04:48,430
oh and I got I got a lot of cool it's

1707
01:04:45,759 --> 01:04:50,048
Tevas oh I just you know someone Charlie

1708
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:52,659
stuff I'm China and I've got some old

1709
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:55,599
herbaria Bush man that I revived and

1710
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:57,879
then I'm doing a ton of my Himalayan

1711
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,460

1713
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:07,028
of the other lines I never released from

1714
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:08,949
those areas else just just going for it

1715
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:11,079
just anything you know every year it's

1716
01:05:08,949 --> 01:05:13,058
so fun cuz I suppose I have a huge CD

1717
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:14,859
collection and I have a big seed fridge

1718
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:16,900
and I just go what this year do I want

1719
01:05:14,858 --> 01:05:18,699
to just go with and you know there's so

1720
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,278
much it can only do like this fraction

1721
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:23,528
of it but so I encourage people to get a

1722
01:05:21,278 --> 01:05:25,389
big seed collection like really I mean

1723
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:27,338
it's so fun because you can just you can

1724
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:29,078
just follow your bliss you can every see

1725
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:32,108
it as an adventure every seat is like

1726
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:34,420
opening a book you know so I think

1727
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:38,288
that's the main stuff I'm Dorking out on

1728
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:40,659
the I wan Afghani is that the same is

1729
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:43,569
Afghani number one or a different thing

1730
01:05:40,659 --> 01:05:46,328
altogether no I just call I just kind of

1731
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:50,980
renamed it I got it I had a kind of an

1732
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:52,900
offline old friend that owed me a favor

1733
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,389
so he gave me some really rare seeds and

1734
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:57,338
it just said roadkill and it was an old

1735
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:59,318
vintage line from NorCal and I was like

1736
01:05:57,338 --> 01:06:01,748
oh cool this is gonna be neat like I

1737
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:03,869
thought maybe be a roadkill stunk or

1738
01:06:01,748 --> 01:06:08,259
something but it just turned out to be a

1739
01:06:03,869 --> 01:06:10,599
really like vintage old super gross

1740
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:12,219
Afghani I'm like okay this is cool and

1741
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,450
so instead of calling a roadkill cuz

1742
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:16,389
it's not because people get so uptight

1743
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:18,068
these days if if it's not exactly how

1744
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:20,798
they remember it's not roadkill kind of

1745
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:23,619
thing so I just called it artifact

1746
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:26,050
anyone or Afghani more like artifact one

1747
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:28,089
it's a it's that true acrid artifacts

1748
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:30,910
that no one's really coming up with but

1749
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:32,980
I know existed okay

1750
01:06:30,909 --> 01:06:35,289
and so another question we got I don't

1751
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,960
know if it was a typo or whether it was

1752
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:39,719
correct so I'll just read it as it is

1753
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,010
what can you tell us about the ae-35

1754
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:45,039
clone that was used in the deep line

1755
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:47,530
alchemy number three okay one of our

1756
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,960
viewers is sent in the question saying

1757
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:51,490
that specifically if you could tell us a

1758
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,990
little bit about your thoughts on the

1759
01:06:51,489 --> 01:06:54,639
line and if you would expect some good

1760
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:55,959
mails to come from it because he was

1761
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:57,549
considering breeding with it but he

1762
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,800
wasn't sure if it was the right type of

1763
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:03,370
line to breed with and just wanted to

1764
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:05,590
know your opinion as a hybrid I think a

1765
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:08,589
lot of those the deep line alchemy are

1766
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:10,030
more for hash making and traditional

1767
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:13,539
hash making but I think they would make

1768
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:15,850
great combos with other lines if you

1769
01:07:13,539 --> 01:07:17,380
especially because they're hybrids are

1770
01:07:15,849 --> 01:07:19,719
you know that those they're usually

1771
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:21,579
pretty inbred plants and by making a

1772
01:07:19,719 --> 01:07:24,399
hybrid that breaks their dominance on

1773
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:28,809
like future hybrids so you know I would

1774
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:32,530
experiment the a35 was a a gift from a

1775
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:35,170
really awesome guy named Black Bart and

1776
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:37,570
he they were an old 35 year old Afghani

1777
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,099
that he's had for a while and you know

1778
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:41,200
he said they had some pretty skunky fie

1779
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:43,690
nose and there's a lot of Denis stuff so

1780
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:45,939
um I grew him out I grew out quite a bit

1781
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:48,039
and the line was really cool and I found

1782
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:50,590
one that was just like really just like

1783
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:52,239
it looked like just someone had bred it

1784
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:55,420
for a long time over in Central Asia

1785
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:58,750
just for hash those super resin is super

1786
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:00,909
dark super virile and it had the smells

1787
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:03,670
are really kind of muted but when you

1788
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:05,649
make concentrates or hash or water hash

1789
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,389
they really come out like they'll you

1790
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:12,430
get like licorice like you get these

1791
01:08:07,389 --> 01:08:14,440
really complex kind of oily earthy

1792
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:16,689
smells that you don't smell so much in

1793
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,670
the plants but that makes amazing

1794
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:20,500
concentrate so the 80-85 has a really

1795
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:22,149
great effect and it's a great plant and

1796
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,789
it has this kind of unique liquorice

1797
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:27,609
scent I don't know if I'll be using it

1798
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:31,800
in this future but for that purpose it

1799
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:35,750
seemed like a good thing okay nice and

1800
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,949
so likewise we've seen some photos of

1801
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,569
if it's the name of the strain on just

1802
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:42,588
where you kind of dubbed the the

1803
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:44,960
Ethiopian paintbrush as well as you know

1804
01:08:42,588 --> 01:08:47,028
the actual strain Ethiopian hash plan or

1805
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,850
the watermelon hash plan both of these

1806
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:51,920
sound you know beyond exotic so to speak

1807
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:53,480
you tell us a little more about them and

1808
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,460
if there's any chance we'll see them

1809
01:08:53,479 --> 01:09:00,409
publicly available yeah I think so yeah

1810
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:02,509
I mean right now that that well the

1811
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:08,960
Ethiopian was a gift from a friend whose

1812
01:09:02,509 --> 01:09:10,579
family comes from that area in it the

1813
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,890
plants that came out were really special

1814
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:14,420
like it definitely khatallah was kind of

1815
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:16,660
like an heirloom or landrace from that

1816
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,460
area there were sativa but they were

1817
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:21,079
they had kind of seen some of the things

1818
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,548
that you could tell they might have been

1819
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:24,350
work kind of like in how South Africa

1820
01:09:22,548 --> 01:09:26,180
they have some of their sativa they've

1821
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:28,220
worked down so that they're relatively

1822
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,500
quick flowering kind of like the Chiss

1823
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,380
key and the Durban some of the turbines

1824
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,239
that are pretty quick

1825
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:37,640
these Ethiopians were relatively quick

1826
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:39,079
but they had really amazing chirping

1827
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,670
signatures and they had a really joyful

1828
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:42,890
kind of meditate

1829
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:45,649
buzz and the two ones that I kept were

1830
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:47,210
the Ethiopian banana one which smells

1831
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:48,739
kind of just like bananas which I

1832
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:52,909
thought it was really cool I loved that

1833
01:09:48,739 --> 01:09:54,769
and then the Ethiopian paintbrush smelt

1834
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:56,149
just like kind of like paint thinner and

1835
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:58,340
then there was another little guy too

1836
01:09:56,149 --> 01:10:00,199
and called the Ethiopian spider and it

1837
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:02,090
just was the weirdest plant ever had the

1838
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:04,550
thinnest leaves and it would like weave

1839
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:06,230
its way through plants like to get to

1840
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:10,220
the light it's almost like kind of like

1841
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:12,349
a creeping vine and so the Ethiopian

1842
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:13,970
Anna I kind of started using it with a

1843
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:15,800
wiki and kind of bringing out those

1844
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:18,730
banana kind of music for banana trips

1845
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,260
and add a little more kind of an exotic

1846
01:10:18,729 --> 01:10:22,639
hit to things and then the paintbrush is

1847
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:25,039
a little more strong it's more of that

1848
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,110
kind of classic kind of mindful sativa

1849
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:28,850
and so those are kind of just ones that

1850
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:30,529
I personally enjoy and I've kind of been

1851
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:32,570
slowly working with them and you know

1852
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:34,119
I've given out the banana to a few

1853
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:36,679
friends and they're playing with it and

1854
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:39,019
it's just a neat it's any Ethiopian line

1855
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:41,030
it's it's not you know always find the

1856
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,440
greatest land right you know land races

1857
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,609
are hit or miss and usually need to go

1858
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:45,049
through quite a few to find unique

1859
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:47,649
things but once in a while you get in

1860
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:49,570
these lines where they

1861
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:51,579
I don't know if they're heirlooms or

1862
01:10:49,569 --> 01:10:53,139
what or you're just lucky but you get a

1863
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:55,929
lot of really cool stuff and just to cut

1864
01:10:53,139 --> 01:10:58,449
in just a small spectrum so I always

1865
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:59,889
enjoy that and then you know the

1866
01:10:58,448 --> 01:11:02,229
watermelon hash plant was just kind of

1867
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:03,368
my first I guess was a Bodi seeds

1868
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:05,198
released but it's kind of technically

1869
01:11:03,368 --> 01:11:09,089
kind of like no Rica it was one of my

1870
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:12,250
early hash pads I collected in the

1871
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:16,239
annapurna range of Nepal that that was

1872
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:18,960
just this beautiful fox healing giant

1873
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:22,149
like relatively quick for the Himalayas

1874
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:25,239
cache plant that smelled just like like

1875
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:26,979
fresh like watermelon and so the you

1876
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:28,658
know I let those out I think maybe it's

1877
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:32,919
been forever maybe even like ten years

1878
01:11:28,658 --> 01:11:34,629
ago I don't know and I think people have

1879
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,639
used those I think they got used in the

1880
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:40,510
auto there's a famous kind of CBD line

1881
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:41,920
in a Colorado and I believe the

1882
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:44,110
watermelon hash plant was used in the

1883
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,429
making of auto which is a CVD line from

1884
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:47,198
there and then a lot of other people

1885
01:11:45,429 --> 01:11:49,029
really enjoyed it but for some reason no

1886
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:52,059
one ever really made any more I've never

1887
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:54,309
seen anybody give them out or make more

1888
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:56,110
like so this year I decided to make some

1889
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,520
more and they're kind of going now so

1890
01:11:56,109 --> 01:11:58,779
people get to kind of experience the

1891
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,690
watermelon hash my whole thing again

1892
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:03,880
it's good breeder and it really kind of

1893
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:09,549
gives you the taste of the kind of

1894
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:11,829
Himalayas sounds awesome and what land

1895
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,570
race variety has left the most lasting

1896
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:16,260
impression on you or maybe not way to

1897
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:23,889
phrase is what's been the most unique

1898
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:25,719
you know I for smoking I really love the

1899
01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:27,489
Himalayan stuff like it doesn't make

1900
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:31,569
good flowers but it makes the most

1901
01:12:27,488 --> 01:12:35,049
amazing hash and I don't know I for land

1902
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:37,389
races there's something about that area

1903
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:40,090
in the culture and the religious use and

1904
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:41,770
the people and the trails and how old it

1905
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:44,739
is and all the lines and all of how all

1906
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:47,139
the valleys have different microclimates

1907
01:12:44,738 --> 01:12:48,428
and different like variations on the

1908
01:12:47,139 --> 01:12:50,679
strains and families have different

1909
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:52,270
things and some to feed the feed the

1910
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:54,429
cattle you know some of these for

1911
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:56,590
veterinary and some for they use for

1912
01:12:54,429 --> 01:12:58,539
chutney and some they use the Baba's

1913
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:01,219
used to get high like there's such an

1914
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:03,889
amazing and vast spectrum

1915
01:13:01,219 --> 01:13:05,538
cannabis in the Himalayan valleys and in

1916
01:13:03,889 --> 01:13:07,219
the cultures that utilize them that like

1917
01:13:05,538 --> 01:13:09,170
I don't know I think that's my heart and

1918
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:11,719
that's like if I can just be myself to

1919
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:13,729
heaven like it would be smoking a big

1920
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:15,260
Chilam of like Himalayan hash and just

1921

smiling at all the people you walk by

1923
01:13:17,328 --> 01:13:22,609
and at that place if I just tell

1924
01:13:20,748 --> 01:13:23,899
everybody in there grandma if there's

1925
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:26,779

1928
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:34,969
make enough money and just go trekking

1929
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:37,340
in the Himalayas life will become clear

1930
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:39,198
like you it'll really nourish your heart

1931
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,639
and soul especially Nepal right now

1932
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,919
because after the earthquake they had up

1933
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:44,118
there having a pretty hard time I mean

1934
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,309
some of the valleys I used to really

1935
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:49,908
love I've been completely wiped out so I

1936
01:13:46,309 --> 01:13:51,679
mean I would say so I mean I guess to

1937
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:54,768
get to it the Himalayas although I do

1938
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:57,769
that that Guatemalan tomb but though

1939
01:13:54,769 --> 01:13:59,809
that is still number one and can some of

1940
01:13:57,769 --> 01:14:05,079
the walkins that I've tried are amazing

1941
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:08,329
Morocco and my favorite China mm-hmm

1942
01:14:05,078 --> 01:14:10,849
Laos pretty awesome

1943
01:14:08,328 --> 01:14:13,929
I don't know wherever I've been all over

1944
01:14:10,849 --> 01:14:16,849
the place but yeah Himalayas and the

1945
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:22,279
Guatemalan - mud and the some tree

1946
01:14:16,849 --> 01:14:26,420
Oaxacan awesome so any plans for any new

1947
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:29,809
your tiger lions to be released from

1948
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:34,300
from Jim Orr of the or or of the from

1949
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:34,300
the sea lion or tiger from the seed line

1950
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:42,380
well not really you know um I made the

1951
01:14:38,658 --> 01:14:45,799
zombie dog with that with our ticket cut

1952
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:48,170
and I don't have to or take it cut

1953
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,960
anymore but I do have I made some seeds

1954
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:53,748
like some f2s and I I do have some

1955
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,578
zombie dog seeds maybe I could do some F

1956
01:14:53,748 --> 01:14:57,679
gen and those those were pretty creepy

1957
01:14:55,578 --> 01:15:00,859
and these giant they were like these are

1958
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:03,469
giant long donkey donkey phallus buds

1959
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:05,630
that smelled kind of like onions and

1960
01:15:03,469 --> 01:15:06,979
walking dead kind of so some people like

1961
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:09,800
that and it would knock people out it

1962
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:11,900
was great for sleeping so maybe some

1963
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:14,130
zombie dong but other than that I don't

1964
01:15:11,899 --> 01:15:17,519
think so I might give out some snow

1965
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:22,350
Lotus Ortega freebies so but yeah that's

1966
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:24,300
about it on that they're taking so do

1967
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:26,400
you have any lines that you've made for

1968
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:29,520
yourself specifically for yourself that

1969
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,750
you can never vision giving out to the

1970
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,400
public so I'm sure there's a lot of

1971
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:33,719
lines which you know just sitting in the

1972
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,000
fridge so to speak but do you have any

1973
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:37,260
where you were like I'm making this and

1974
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,448
I'm never going to give it out to the

1975
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:44,400
public well you know I that would be sad

1976
01:15:42,448 --> 01:15:45,988
in a selfish way but you know what I

1977
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,000
mean we maybe you were thinking like no

1978
01:15:45,988 --> 01:15:49,948
I need it for future projects or

1979
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,260
something like that you know yeah I mean

1980
01:15:49,948 --> 01:15:53,339
I'll sit on things but I there's never a

1981
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,690
point where I'm like that's never

1982
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,250
getting out I have a couple like clone

1983
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:58,019
onlys that I haven't even give to like

1984
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,969
friends but I'm sure if they asked I'd

1985
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,980
be like well yeah try this and I think

1986
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:03,480
that I'm gonna some of my like personal

1987
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:05,609
favorites that I don't ever let out I

1988
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:07,529
might let out maybe you know there's a

1989
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:09,479
couple plants like where Stevie Wonder

1990
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:12,119
I've never given to anyone because it's

1991
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:13,979
it's one of my earliest crosses and it's

1992
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:17,069
it's such an awesome thing I wouldn't

1993
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:19,198
want to see it get kind of just taken

1994
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:20,579
apart and um but you know I have a

1995
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:21,719
couple special things that I want to

1996
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:24,359
give out eventually like I have the

1997
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:27,630
access access which is a really awesome

1998
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:29,908
plan it's like a Congolese Hache plan

1999
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:33,210
and I have this one called lush that I

2000
01:16:29,908 --> 01:16:35,039
really love that's a pure crush Lao that

2001
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:39,448
I think needs to eventually get out and

2002
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:41,130
you know I try and just I don't mice I

2003
01:16:39,448 --> 01:16:43,859
have so many seeds in my fridge like I

2004
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:46,500
try and just whenever I can get them out

2005
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:48,750
like so I do a lot of freebies and

2006
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:50,789
there's nothing really that you know

2007
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:52,260
things the only things that aren't

2008
01:16:50,789 --> 01:16:54,539
coming out to the public are things that

2009
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:57,389
I think are dangerous like maybe still

2010
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:59,698
have latent hermaphroditic tendencies or

2011
01:16:57,389 --> 01:17:01,710
things that I went things that are more

2012
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:03,599
that I wouldn't want that impact people

2013
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:05,819
in a negative way are kind of like what

2014
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,190
I hold back or crosses that I think are

2015
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:10,139
too dangerous or even you know there's

2016
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:11,879
some testers I won't even send out to

2017
01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:13,829
testers because I don't I just do it

2018
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:17,069
myself cuz I don't I don't trust the

2019
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:19,500
cross enough to want to even have people

2020
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:22,259
put their time and energy into it so I

2021
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:24,420
think everything will come out there's

2022
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:26,520
no there's nothing that I'm gonna hold

2023
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:29,340
on for dear life

2024
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:32,130
yeah okay and so do you have advice for

2025
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:34,230
people on how to best feed a hunt I

2026
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:36,659
think what the viewer was looking for

2027
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:39,239
was maybe things like is there like a

2028
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:40,590
certain size pot you like to use where

2029
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:42,329
it's kind of small enough that you can

2030
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:43,860
get a lot of plants in but big enough to

2031
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:45,899
get a good representation of the plant

2032
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:47,460
or you know just in general what do you

2033
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:49,889
were kind of tips for Fino hunting in

2034
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:53,970
general if I'm trying to run through a

2035
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:56,010
lot I put I don't know it's like there's

2036
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:57,750
pretty tall square plots and they fit

2037
01:17:56,010 --> 01:18:00,000
eight to a tray what is that like a

2038
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,560
quarter gallon or a half gallon or

2039
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,689
something

2040
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,300
I like those you can pretty much keep

2041
01:18:03,689 --> 01:18:09,869
them healthy is you go throw them right

2042
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:11,190
in right when they sex and that works

2043
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:13,559
really good and you can kind of just

2044
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:16,049
stack those up when I do a lot of the

2045
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:18,870
outdoor to indoor work I usually use a

2046
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:21,029
three gallons and wait till they section

2047
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:25,529
as they sex I'll clone them and run them

2048
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:27,420
inside and see how they do inside I mean

2049
01:18:25,529 --> 01:18:30,389
but you can I mean you could I know

2050
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:33,119
people that do kooky stuff like you know

2051
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:35,280
dude twelve twelve from seed and and run

2052
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:38,309
them in like these micro pots and just

2053
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:41,609
like you know people do amazing things

2054
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:43,470
with a with a not a lot of space and

2055
01:18:41,609 --> 01:18:46,409
I've seen like insane open politicians

2056
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:48,630
and people's like showers where they

2057
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:51,569
just like run things you know twelve

2058
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:53,279
twelve even CTOs twelve twelve from seed

2059
01:18:51,569 --> 01:18:55,170
like in these tiny little things and

2060
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:57,630
just put like a couple hundred in there

2061
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:59,399
and I'm just like whoa and you know then

2062
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:01,409
people will revenge those and I'm like

2063
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:04,079
that is awesome so I think it'd be

2064
01:19:01,409 --> 01:19:06,329
creative but for me I usually trying

2065
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:10,409
anything that fits about eight to tray

2066
01:19:06,329 --> 01:19:10,890
one of those standard black trays it's

2067
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:13,019
good

2068
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:14,460
another little off topic one what was

2069
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:20,160
your favorite year of Grateful Dead

2070
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:22,319
music I would say probably the times

2071
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:24,479
that I would go like I know I'm not like

2072
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:27,059
world's ultimate Grateful Dead

2073
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:29,699
I usually just went more to get for the

2074
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:31,920
parking-lot culture cuz I was I loved it

2075
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:33,689
and I loved all seeing all the people

2076
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,359
eat up people and shake down Street and

2077
01:19:33,689 --> 01:19:38,159
all the music and I love getting my LSD

2078
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:39,439
and a mushroom supply for the next

2079
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:45,599
couple

2080
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:47,969
um you know I would say aye aye

2081
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,100
I think the fur I the first time I ever

2082
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:51,900
saw him as I took my mom got me a bus

2083
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,370
pass so I could go in the record stores

2084
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:55,949
and I could go to the libraries and look

2085
01:19:53,369 --> 01:19:59,159
at weird books about plants when I was

2086
01:19:55,949 --> 01:20:02,010
in the beginning of high school and I

2087
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:04,470
remember I took the bus one day to the

2088
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:07,020
from Huntington Beach to Long Beach to

2089
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:10,079
the dead show and I think I was maybe

2090
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:11,910
like 60 No and so I was like just it was

2091
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,010
pre touch of gray when I think that's

2092
01:20:11,909 --> 01:20:16,909
kind of when everything turned weird for

2093
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:19,829
me because I so I would say maybe like

2094
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:22,979
87 or something although I know all that

2095
01:20:19,829 --> 01:20:25,590
everybody says all those I mean but so

2096
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:33,899
just sometimes it went you know from

2097
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:36,180
maybe 89 to 90 for 87 to 95 okay but I

2098
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:37,829
mean away a big I'm not you know I've

2099
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,780
been to lots of shows but I can't say

2100
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:41,880
I'm like super deadhead because there's

2101
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:43,889
so many people that there just boggle my

2102
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:45,539
mind with like you know they're like oh

2103
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:47,250
yeah that's the year where they went

2104
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:49,199
trying to set its own flower until fire

2105
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:51,510
on the melody like in like their minds

2106
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:53,760
like how my mind has music and strains

2107
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:55,680
they have the mind of like Grateful Dead

2108
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:59,820
information and I think that is pretty

2109
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:01,409
awesome yeah I mean the knowledge some

2110
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:04,109
people have honored all these pretty

2111
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:05,699
crazy the way they can tell tell the

2112
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:08,130
year and the charge is from listening to

2113
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:09,420
the audio yeah that's beautiful and my

2114
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:11,159
thing about the Grateful Dead is I

2115
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:13,890
personally more than music and anything

2116
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:15,809
I honor them and I respect and I give so

2117
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:19,050
much thanks for them for being the

2118
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:22,289
traveling psychedelic dispersion

2119
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:24,989
mechanism for you know for 50 years like

2120
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:26,760
if they didn't exist the world America

2121
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:29,960
would be a totally different place they

2122
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:32,670
toured and took you know like

2123
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:34,649
heart-opening mind-opening substances

2124
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:37,170
all over the Americas not to mention all

2125
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:38,789
the seeds that went out and disseminated

2126
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:42,480
all over the United States they were

2127
01:21:38,789 --> 01:21:44,640
like this this like a circus of

2128
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:44,969
awakening that moved through time and

2129
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,670
space

2130
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:48,990
all through America and without them I

2131
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:51,869
don't know what it would be like today

2132
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:54,269
so I give maximum props

2133
01:21:51,869 --> 01:21:57,649
Grateful Dead thank you for creating a

2134
01:21:54,270 --> 01:22:01,140
community that made the world different

2135
01:21:57,649 --> 01:22:04,349
yeah I agree I think especially given

2136
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:07,200
Kem dog eyes its origins to the car park

2137
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:09,180
scene so to speak it's yep certainly

2138
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:11,099
needs to have its homage paid this is

2139
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,810
probably gonna be the last question from

2140
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:15,570
the viewers who's just managed to

2141
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:18,990
squeeze it in two minutes ago Wow

2142
01:22:15,569 --> 01:22:20,789
a job yeah long story short he wants to

2143
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:23,069
know he's got a few questions in here

2144
01:22:20,789 --> 01:22:24,750
but I think the best one is are you

2145
01:22:23,069 --> 01:22:27,210
working with any of the more old-school

2146
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:29,329
clones like for example the New York hey

2147
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:32,159
zo just also known as the Uptown PF

2148
01:22:29,329 --> 01:22:37,890
Skelly hash plan one of my favorites or

2149
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:39,779
the shoreline you know I haven't see I'm

2150
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:43,470
kind of funny I don't it's hard for I

2151
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:47,250
mean to get some of these really unique

2152
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:49,770
clones these days I kind of just do it

2153
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:51,810
hand to hand so I don't get to try some

2154
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:53,940
of the all the super neat stuff I kind

2155
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:56,210
of have to wait for it to get to me but

2156
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:58,859
I do have a lot of the old stuff

2157
01:22:56,210 --> 01:23:01,859
the skellies in my area but I don't I

2158
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:04,769
haven't been authorized yeah yet to have

2159
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:07,049
it so that maybe someday but I have

2160
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:09,690
smoked it and I do think it's pretty

2161
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:11,310
awesome and rad I like that I love that

2162
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:13,049
the Cuban Black Keys is he's a unique

2163
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:14,880
planet I work with that some I made that

2164
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:18,029
bandaid haze with that which is kind of

2165
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,710
like a my version of a picture cheap

2166
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:24,539
plant and people tend to really like

2167
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:26,850
that the Cuban black haze by itself is a

2168
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:29,010
really strange plant cuz it gets so big

2169
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:31,560
and it takes you know cut takes kind of

2170
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:33,930
a while but kind of look I caught like a

2171
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,640
tequila weed like you know how's that

2172
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:38,400
certain Mexicans have that - it's like

2173
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:40,320
the sloshy kind of like psychedelic slop

2174
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:43,229
kinda like if you mix alcohol and

2175
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:48,139
sativas it's like this really sloshy

2176
01:23:43,229 --> 01:23:51,299
kind of tequila like wild buzz and then

2177
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:53,250
Shoreline uh I would love to see a good

2178
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:55,680
shoreline I've never grown a shoreline

2179
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:57,829
I've only heard cool things about it how

2180
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:00,240
it's like almost like a roadkill e thing

2181
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:02,340
you know those and there's the dumpster

2182
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,538
there's so much cool neat stuff I you

2183
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:07,380
know and that's

2184
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:09,389
I love like I grow crazy weird everyday

2185
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:11,190
you know I love to grow as many possible

2186
01:24:09,389 --> 01:24:12,748
clones that people give me because I

2187
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:15,478
just love to check it all out I mean

2188
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:17,488
it's if I get to see it just you know I

2189
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:19,800
go into my room I get so excited to see

2190
01:24:17,488 --> 01:24:22,259
what plants are doing especially these

2191
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:24,208
clones and what you know what's the hype

2192
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:26,909
of the day or what's the old I like it's

2193
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:29,340
so satisfying to kind of see and

2194
01:24:26,908 --> 01:24:30,868
experience these plants and that's what

2195
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:34,019
I tell people about cannabis it's like

2196
01:24:30,868 --> 01:24:37,319
there's no other pursuit on earth

2197
01:24:34,019 --> 01:24:41,099
besides maybe being a chef where you can

2198
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:44,819
be so creative and so there's so much

2199
01:24:41,099 --> 01:24:46,979
uniqueness and then when it's all said

2200
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:48,719
and done you get to inhale it and it

2201
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:50,820
becomes alive in your mind there's no

2202
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,948
other pursuit you know you can race car

2203
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:54,958
you can do all this you can cook you can

2204
01:24:52,948 --> 01:24:56,518
make a fabulous food shirt it satisfies

2205
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:58,738
all your senses like your touch your

2206
01:24:56,519 --> 01:25:01,079
sight your smell your sound but cannabis

2207
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:04,259
is the only thing that hits all of those

2208
01:25:01,078 --> 01:25:06,058
and you get your mind open to it's like

2209
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:07,619
like that's the ultimate thank you

2210
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:09,479
something that satisfies all your senses

2211
01:25:07,618 --> 01:25:11,429
and you get to bring it into your body

2212
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:14,159
and experience it that way I don't think

2213
01:25:11,429 --> 01:25:16,170
there's anything else like that yeah I

2214
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,629
think the food one's a good analogy I

2215
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:19,889
wouldn't have thought of that myself

2216
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:21,420
yeah because there's awesome chefs like

2217
01:25:19,889 --> 01:25:23,400
in is visceral you can make the coolest

2218
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:24,958
stuff and it smells so good it tastes

2219
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:26,819
good it makes you feel good but it

2220
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:32,670
doesn't change your mind maybe it's kind

2221
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:34,198
of but yeah so one of the last couple of

2222
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:37,529
questions I always like to wrap it up

2223
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:40,498
with is if you go back to one place in

2224
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:41,849
history and time so to speak where would

2225
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:48,328
you go you know to collect some land

2226
01:25:41,849 --> 01:25:49,889
rice seeds how to collect seeds I would

2227
01:25:48,328 --> 01:25:52,198
love to go to Iran right before the

2228
01:25:49,889 --> 01:25:54,389
Ayatollah kind of kicked in like before

2229
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:56,428
they threw out the Shah when it was like

2230
01:25:54,389 --> 01:26:00,239
when it was have you ever seen pictures

2231
01:25:56,429 --> 01:26:02,279
of Iran before the yeah it's very

2232
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,538
Western looking it was so Western

2233
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:05,279
everybody know there's no burgers

2234
01:26:03,538 --> 01:26:07,228
everybody was so it was like this modern

2235
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:10,228
everybody was so happy they must have

2236
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:13,050
had some really awesome strains before

2237
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:15,090
you know that and you know I mean people

2238
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:16,449
say like Afghanistan before the Soviet

2239
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:19,840
invasion but I don't know you

2240
01:26:16,449 --> 01:26:23,369
I don't think I'd really like to go is I

2241
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:28,170
would love to go along the Silk Road

2242
01:26:23,369 --> 01:26:32,859
like way back maybe like you know like

2243
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:34,270
thousand BC and just experienced all of

2244
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:37,119
that because people talk about the

2245
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:38,950
hippie trail and all that and you know

2246
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:40,809
all that's where all these cool seeds

2247
01:26:38,949 --> 01:26:43,059
and strains came from but the hip trails

2248
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:45,190
like relatively new the Silk Road was

2249
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:47,260
where it was that people were you know

2250
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:49,269
from China all the way to like the

2251
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:51,789
Mediterranean and people were trading

2252
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:54,700
you know linens and seeds and fruits and

2253
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:56,590
nuts and of course seeds were coming

2254
01:26:54,699 --> 01:26:58,510
from China going through all these men's

2255
01:26:56,590 --> 01:27:00,940
seeds from that things that was like

2256
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:03,039
that was like the mod I mean if there

2257
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:05,799
was one age I think of when cannabis was

2258
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:08,170
really kicking into gear and really

2259
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:11,680
people making some cool stuff it was

2260
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:16,270
back on the Silk Road when it was really

2261
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:19,329
pump and yeah we're that out so which

2262
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:20,740
strain has the way I normally phrase it

2263
01:27:19,329 --> 01:27:22,420
is which strain do you like the least

2264
01:27:20,739 --> 01:27:25,239
but I have a feeling you'll say you like

2265
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:27,510
all strains so he'll say which one which

2266
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:31,329
one kind of spoke to you the least I

2267
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:34,780
mean like growing or are taking into my

2268
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:37,420
body a consumption let me see which one

2269
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:40,899
that I don't like hmm

2270
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:45,960
I think if there's any strain that just

2271
01:27:40,899 --> 01:27:45,960
mainly feel like super gross

2272
01:27:47,489 --> 01:27:56,369
that's hard you know because they love

2273
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:58,750
their personality I think it it's I

2274
01:27:56,369 --> 01:28:00,609
smoked so many strains I should like

2275
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:04,720
really look right down like this thing

2276
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:06,639
drove me nuts I can't really answer that

2277
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,829
I don't I don't know I've grown some

2278
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:14,890
strains that kind of sucked but smoking

2279
01:28:08,829 --> 01:28:19,899
it what what just sucks I don't know I

2280
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:25,539
mean you smoking a ham pawned off as

2281
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:27,729
buds in some foreign country yeah you

2282
01:28:25,539 --> 01:28:29,828
got me on that and I haven't I can't I

2283
01:28:27,729 --> 01:28:31,569
cannot answer that I don't even know

2284
01:28:29,828 --> 01:28:33,399
but as soon as I find something that

2285
01:28:31,569 --> 01:28:38,109
really sucks I will remember it and I

2286
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:40,779
will get it to you not have to update at

2287
01:28:38,109 --> 01:28:42,539
that point that was like a stumper it's

2288
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:45,550
like okay

2289
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:47,380
alrighty final question I want to end on

2290
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:49,539
a bit of a controversial one we're not

2291
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:51,550
really for you but I'm gonna be pretty

2292
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:53,109
funny so shout out to my friend art from

2293
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:55,300
round table selections for submitting

2294
01:28:53,109 --> 01:28:56,889
this one I think the best way to end it

2295
01:28:55,300 --> 01:29:01,840
will be just to give a simple yes-or-no

2296
01:28:56,889 --> 01:29:06,400
answer okay what is it do you think the

2297
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:08,469
earth is flat oh you know the universe

2298
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:10,118
is a really unique and special magical

2299
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:12,689
place that amazes me every day I

2300
01:29:10,118 --> 01:29:16,229
personally don't think it's flat but I

2301
01:29:12,689 --> 01:29:18,368
don't know I I get I get amazed and

2302
01:29:16,229 --> 01:29:20,229
every day at some of the things I

2303
01:29:18,368 --> 01:29:23,469
learned and I wouldn't put it past the

2304
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:25,359
earth to be some crazy thing I like flat

2305
01:29:23,469 --> 01:29:27,908
I don't know where the water goes but

2306
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:29,259
I'm down you know I'm just happy to be

2307
01:29:27,908 --> 01:29:30,609
here alive on planet Earth

2308
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:32,920
I don't care if it's flat if it's round

2309
01:29:30,609 --> 01:29:35,469
it's square I'm just so stoked that I

2310
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,449
won the lottery to be a human on this

2311
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:39,399
planet in this time with all these

2312
01:29:37,448 --> 01:29:42,069
people doing all this crazy stuff it's

2313
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:44,049
the planet of apes who cares I'm just

2314
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:45,819
happy to be here so doesn't really

2315
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:47,679
matter what shape or form it is for me I

2316
01:29:45,819 --> 01:29:52,630
guess that wasn't yes or no though so

2317
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:55,059
I'm gonna say if it was like like a

2318
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:59,380
scantron and my life depended on it I'm

2319
01:29:55,059 --> 01:30:01,179
gonna say no it is not flat but I'm open

2320
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:03,099
to extreme possibilities and if it was

2321
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:07,239
flat I don't really care because I kind

2322
01:30:03,099 --> 01:30:12,010
of dig just being here fantastic feeding

2323
01:30:07,238 --> 01:30:15,368

01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:17,230
to just be exploding with happiness yeah

2325
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:20,738

2326
01:30:17,229 --> 01:30:24,158

so thank you so much for coming on the

2329
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:30,339
show and spending whopping four hours

2330
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:32,469
with this oh wow that's that's a long

2331
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:33,789
time it just creeps past I ate so I even

2332
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:37,750
had more stuff to talk about

2333
01:30:33,789 --> 01:30:40,269
well jam it in oh yeah we can jam it in

2334
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:43,149
I also want to encourage people even

2335
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:43,670
well not everyone but people use your

2336
01:30:43,149 --> 01:30:46,609
intelligence

2337
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:48,590
I would love everybody to definitely do

2338
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:50,689
more psychedelics I think this is very

2339
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:52,760
important in a breeding philosophy to

2340
01:30:50,689 --> 01:30:56,059
connect with the earth the plants and

2341
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:59,539
yourself but do it responsibly and do it

2342
01:30:56,060 --> 01:31:01,160
in nature and you think all forms of

2343
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:02,600
psychedelics any particular ones like

2344
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:04,309
I've got friends who particularly

2345
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:07,250
advocate for mushrooms because they find

2346
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:09,830
it to be a little more natural yeah I

2347
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:11,659
would say I would for me I would say if

2348
01:31:09,829 --> 01:31:13,069
you're interested in plants and plant

2349
01:31:11,659 --> 01:31:16,550
breeding and cannabis

2350
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:19,549
my thing is XP rants I'm gonna say if

2351
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:21,590
you enjoy where cannabis takes you and

2352
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:23,480
in the and what it does for you there's

2353
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:27,440
many plants on planet earth that have

2354
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:29,000
been strategically planted here to open

2355
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:33,079
your mind and connect you into deeper

2356
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:35,329
places spaces healings it's you know

2357
01:31:33,079 --> 01:31:37,369
cannabis isn't the only plant I think

2358
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:41,779
it's our primordial I think it's like

2359
01:31:37,369 --> 01:31:43,189
our definitive ally plant but I think

2360
01:31:41,779 --> 01:31:45,289
there's so many unique plants out there

2361
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:47,509
just waiting to teach you things and I

2362
01:31:45,289 --> 01:31:50,119
think that we can develop a greater

2363
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:52,460
appreciation of nature ourselves and the

2364
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:53,869
planet by going into these states I

2365
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:56,899
don't have a Kate recreational

2366
01:31:53,869 --> 01:32:00,439
psychedelic use but I a responsible

2367
01:31:56,899 --> 01:32:02,448
personal or group and it's with a

2368
01:32:00,439 --> 01:32:06,289
positive set in setting I think go for

2369
01:32:02,448 --> 01:32:09,710
please everyone I mean expand your mind

2370
01:32:06,289 --> 01:32:11,779
get in touch you know find find that

2371
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:15,198
special place in your heart that that

2372
01:32:11,779 --> 01:32:18,139
opens up to all creation yeah without a

2373
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:20,960
doubt I'm a just out of curiosity have

2374
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:23,449
you ever used salvia and what were your

2375
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:26,539
experiences on it you know it's funny as

2376
01:32:23,448 --> 01:32:30,109
I have a I collect salvia strains it's

2377
01:32:26,539 --> 01:32:35,539
you so I actually have about five now

2378
01:32:30,109 --> 01:32:37,460
but you know so I mean is it okay if I

2379
01:32:35,539 --> 01:32:42,310
get it's a little bit of a story is that

2380
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:44,869
okay yeah we love stories so you know

2381
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:47,570
back when I was young I always wanted to

2382
01:32:44,869 --> 01:32:49,039
be an ethyl botanist and so my our first

2383
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:51,130
big adventure my friend was really into

2384
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:53,779
archeology and I was really into

2385
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:55,699
ethnobotany so I brought my plants of

2386
01:32:53,779 --> 01:32:57,268
the gods cards and he brought all of his

2387
01:32:55,698 --> 01:33:00,838
archaeology books and we did our first

2388
01:32:57,269 --> 01:33:04,319
big trip in our 20s we landed in Cancun

2389
01:33:00,838 --> 01:33:05,548
and we like hitchhiked and rode buses

2390
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,169
because of the infrastructure for

2391
01:33:05,548 --> 01:33:10,048
tourism was a lot different back in the

2392
01:33:07,168 --> 01:33:11,969
nineteen ninety and we were all through

2393
01:33:10,048 --> 01:33:14,248
the Yucatan all through Belize all

2394
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:17,038
through Guam all through Mexico and all

2395
01:33:14,248 --> 01:33:18,748
the way back all the way to Tijuana and

2396
01:33:17,038 --> 01:33:20,278
my big thing is he wanted to see the

2397
01:33:18,748 --> 01:33:22,738
temples and I wanted to retrace the

2398
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:25,439
footsteps of our guard and wasan in his

2399
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:27,509
search for the mushrooms so after we did

2400
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:29,429
all the temples we got to go up and we

2401
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:33,869
went to Wow day Jimenez in this year a

2402
01:33:29,429 --> 01:33:35,578
Mazatec to experience that you know the

2403
01:33:33,868 --> 01:33:38,458
culture of mushroom shamanism and all

2404
01:33:35,578 --> 01:33:40,498
the other plants they use and one of the

2405
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:43,618
things is we had our card and it was a

2406
01:33:40,498 --> 01:33:46,019
rare mint type plant that no one quite

2407
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:47,728
knew about or what how it worked and

2408
01:33:46,019 --> 01:33:50,208
that was a salvia divinorum before

2409
01:33:47,729 --> 01:33:53,249
people got kind of turned on to it and

2410
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:54,838
it was before they realized that it was

2411
01:33:53,248 --> 01:33:57,568
a masticating plant like it went through

2412
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:59,760
your mucous membranes so we found a

2413
01:33:57,569 --> 01:34:01,289
woman that you know took her all day to

2414
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,179
hikes the place and got it and then she

2415
01:34:01,288 --> 01:34:06,389
made us he's like shamrock shakes where

2416
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:09,179
she just blended it in water and that

2417
01:34:06,389 --> 01:34:11,699
was and you know we drank those and

2418
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:14,069
since you don't really it gets destroyed

2419
01:34:11,698 --> 01:34:16,648
in your gut we got these really light

2420
01:34:14,069 --> 01:34:18,689
effects from it and it was so beautiful

2421
01:34:16,649 --> 01:34:20,789
and so feminine so special but it didn't

2422
01:34:18,689 --> 01:34:23,999
really hit us and it always kind of had

2423
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:26,788
a special part so when it became kind of

2424
01:34:23,998 --> 01:34:28,078
a thing and people started smoking it I

2425
01:34:26,788 --> 01:34:30,418
kind of started collecting the strains

2426
01:34:28,078 --> 01:34:34,318
and people don't realize like that plant

2427
01:34:30,418 --> 01:34:37,229
spirit is so it's so moist and so

2428
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:39,089
feminine like it despises heat and fire

2429
01:34:37,229 --> 01:34:40,649
so all these people are smoking and

2430
01:34:39,088 --> 01:34:42,328
going cuckoo and running through walls

2431
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:44,249
like I mean it's kind of fun on YouTube

2432
01:34:42,328 --> 01:34:47,518
to watch the salvia freak out so I got

2433
01:34:44,248 --> 01:34:50,760
in it you know you know in a kind of

2434
01:34:47,519 --> 01:34:52,559
weird way but the key to salvia is you

2435
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,659
make a quid and you just put it in your

2436
01:34:52,559 --> 01:34:57,689
lip and you find some quiet place and

2437
01:34:54,658 --> 01:35:00,298
she will take you deep into her healing

2438
01:34:57,689 --> 01:35:02,579
garden and it is so special and so

2439
01:35:00,298 --> 01:35:08,028
magical but I mean I have smoked it and

2440
01:35:02,578 --> 01:35:08,028
I have had some very intense and

2441
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:12,869
unimaginable things happening but really

2442
01:35:10,829 --> 01:35:15,149
key to that plant is it's very family

2443
01:35:12,869 --> 01:35:19,470
it's very moist and it really loves just

2444
01:35:15,149 --> 01:35:22,019
to you know be stuck in your lip and a

2445
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:25,260
quid and it's sad that it's been

2446
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:26,940
outlawed yes interesting that you

2447
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:28,980
mentioned that it intense is another

2448
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:31,529
word that uh I would use to describe my

2449
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:33,479
own experience with it but um it's I

2450
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:34,679
didn't know yeah you could just kind of

2451
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:37,319
sit it in your mouth that's an

2452
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:38,820
interesting one I'm kind of just

2453
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:41,809
springing to mind from that same idea

2454
01:35:38,819 --> 01:35:44,819
have you toid around with kratom at all

2455
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:47,840
you know I'm not it I have tried kratom

2456
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:50,819
and but you know it's

2457
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:53,400
I'm not a big opiate person and I'm not

2458
01:35:50,819 --> 01:35:56,189
a big stimulant and being literate she

2459
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:57,449
depending on you know its its location

2460
01:35:56,189 --> 01:35:59,929
and if it's you know the different stem

2461
01:35:57,449 --> 01:36:01,769
colors and morphology how they have

2462
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:04,159
alkaloids I think it's an amazing

2463
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:08,400
adjunct for people that are dealing with

2464
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:10,289
opiate dependence and I think it is a

2465
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:13,559
really amazing healing plant but it's it

2466
01:36:10,289 --> 01:36:17,039
for me it was just it I don't like

2467
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:19,560
things that they mess with my physiology

2468
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:21,979
so much that I have I cup body

2469
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:25,020
disturbances and I know it has kind of a

2470
01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:26,250
strange dosage response curve like or if

2471
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:28,650
you take too much you can be very

2472
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:30,930
uncomfortable so I never really

2473
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:32,609
connected to kratom like I think my

2474
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:36,090
favorite you know if I had to pick stuff

2475
01:36:32,609 --> 01:36:40,109
is I like cannabis I like mushrooms

2476
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:43,860
those are my faves I like cactus like

2477
01:36:40,109 --> 01:36:47,369
San Pedro and Trico serious I mean I

2478
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:51,989
mean I do ayahuasca is another thing I

2479
01:36:47,369 --> 01:36:56,309
mean it definitely has a place but it is

2480
01:36:51,989 --> 01:36:59,179
kind of kicks your ass just mushrooms

2481
01:36:56,310 --> 01:37:03,330
and oh we need his mushrooms and

2482
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:05,130
cannabis and we're ready to go but I do

2483
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:07,500
like coffee I like all plants like I I

2484
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:09,300
have a complex you caught a chart or

2485
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:12,270
whatever you want to call it up but you

2486
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:14,699
know I I'm open to try anything you know

2487
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:16,290
I look I just love all the plants and

2488
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:19,529
all the plants spirit allies are just

2489
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:22,050
spirit plants just really that's that's

2490
01:37:19,529 --> 01:37:22,800
where my my heart goes oh I'd love to

2491
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:24,480
try car

2492
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,159
it cuts great it's easy good see

2493
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:28,349
they're easy to sprout I mean not really

2494
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:30,659
but I mean you can do it probably great

2495
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:32,160
in your area I'm gonna say I heard that

2496
01:37:30,659 --> 01:37:33,988
the seeds are a little hard to sprout

2497
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:35,760
I'll give it a girl I'm a bit more green

2498
01:37:33,988 --> 01:37:38,219
thumb nowadays than when I last tried

2499
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,869
many years ago as a kid yeah it's just

2500
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:43,140
about weighting the hardest ones ever

2501
01:37:39,869 --> 01:37:44,819
are coca seeds like I've never been able

2502
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:46,619
to do that they only have like a two

2503
01:37:44,819 --> 01:37:49,049
week germination period one when they're

2504
01:37:46,619 --> 01:37:51,420
fresh and you it's literally like they

2505
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:53,789
mold out it's like it's super hard

2506
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:55,230
caught you just kind of get a moist and

2507
01:37:53,789 --> 01:37:57,930
kind of don't look at him for a couple

2508
01:37:55,229 --> 01:37:59,969
weeks yeah I mean interesting you

2509
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:01,619
mentioned that I through a friend of a

2510
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:04,949
friend I I knew someone who had like a

2511
01:38:01,619 --> 01:38:07,680
single cocoa plant here in Australia

2512
01:38:04,949 --> 01:38:09,329
actually and funnily enough like what I

2513
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,980
had heard from the guy who had it was

2514
01:38:09,329 --> 01:38:13,019
that like just wasn't even worth

2515
01:38:10,979 --> 01:38:15,059
pursuing because like it just you know

2516
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:16,440
it kind of became to the land racing you

2517
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,330
know he's just flipping out and the

2518
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:20,879
Australian and barbed and just not even

2519
01:38:18,329 --> 01:38:22,399
productive at all yeah well I think

2520
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,779
there's an Indonesian or a Javanese

2521
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:28,170
variety of coconut they're growing it

2522
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:30,689
might work better for your climate yeah

2523
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:32,640
most likely well and people are doing it

2524
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:34,259
indoors now and I know in our area we

2525
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,130
had a coca plant that was kind of going

2526
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:37,470
around underground

2527
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:38,850
that was an imposture it was somebody

2528
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:40,920
claimed it with a coca but it really

2529
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:42,360
wasn't it had this caustic white SAP so

2530
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:47,310
whenever you would chew it you're like

2531
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:50,309
lips would burst into flames but I love

2532
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:53,310
Coco I've never tried cocaine yet I mean

2533
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:55,200
maybe some day but I loved shooting coca

2534
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:56,370
like I probably shoot my weight in coca

2535
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:58,738
when I've been in like South America

2536
01:38:56,369 --> 01:39:01,170
especially up in the Andes like oh my

2537
01:38:58,738 --> 01:39:02,969
god I just I mean definitely roast your

2538
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:05,159
mouth with all the line but what a

2539
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:07,350
beautiful plant like I can see you know

2540
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:09,449
up there where there's no oxygen and

2541
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:12,600
people are working hard it's just like

2542
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:15,210
angels come down and touch you like you

2543
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:17,160
can breathe you feel vibrant like it's

2544
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:20,340
not vitamins it's such a healing crop

2545
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:24,029
for those Andean people maybe maybe you

2546
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:25,710
should stay away from okay yeah I mean I

2547
01:39:24,029 --> 01:39:28,769
don't know I like coca leaf you know you

2548
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:33,239
guys have a you have the water leaf huh

2549
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:35,370
you have a lot of DMT containing uh like

2550
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:36,609
trees in Australia

2551
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:38,680
oh yes

2552
01:39:36,609 --> 01:39:43,179
takes me back to being a young boy doing

2553
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:44,770
the old acid-base extraction that's that

2554
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:46,480
it's a bit of a sad story actually

2555
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:48,100
because you there's certain parts of

2556
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:50,019
Australia where it grows really well and

2557
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:51,760
you go there and the trees have just

2558
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:54,700
been absolutely stripped of all their

2559
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,500
bark and yeah they're really struggling

2560
01:39:54,699 --> 01:39:59,439
because if people just go on to town on

2561
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:01,210
it oh my gosh I know now that's a big

2562
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:04,389
choco craze everybody wants it to make

2563
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:05,890
their chaga and yeah it's a strange

2564
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:09,579
thing I wish people got more into flares

2565
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:12,970
but I guess it's just not a viable plant

2566
01:40:09,579 --> 01:40:14,649
for extraction you know what's

2567
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:17,199
interesting is it's kind of maybe a

2568
01:40:14,649 --> 01:40:20,469
little peripheral but it was actually in

2569
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:22,869
that extraction of the DMT from the

2570
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:24,280
acacia probably about eight or nine

2571
01:40:22,869 --> 01:40:26,680
years ago now when I first learned about

2572
01:40:24,279 --> 01:40:28,059
it they were doing dewaxing you know

2573
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:30,190
like you're removing the lipids from the

2574
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:31,390
concentrates back then but they

2575
01:40:30,189 --> 01:40:33,159
certainly haven't started doing that

2576
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:34,390
until much more recently with cannabis I

2577
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:36,399
think that's kind of interesting how

2578
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:38,680
they were like ahead of the curve in

2579
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:40,000
that respect at least yeah as well I

2580
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:41,920
mean that kind of just goes back into

2581
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,479
your basic crime biochemistry I think

2582
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:46,449
with us donors we don't really we never

2583
01:40:43,479 --> 01:40:48,849
really had that science background you

2584
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:53,289
know and it seems like when you're

2585
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:55,150
actually doing scientific extraction

2586
01:40:53,289 --> 01:40:56,859
you're kind of have to involve those

2587
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:58,149
principles so I think it's donors we

2588
01:40:56,859 --> 01:40:59,769
just never got it but yeah that's true

2589
01:40:58,149 --> 01:41:01,960
they were dewaxing and then there was

2590
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:03,700
that kind of like that rough extract it

2591
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:05,939
was like the jungle spice that had that

2592
01:41:03,699 --> 01:41:08,260
kind of yellow wax and they found that

2593
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:09,460
something actually constituents in it so

2594
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:12,909
they're kind of pulling out some of the

2595
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:14,800
good stuff yeah I actually only ever

2596
01:41:12,909 --> 01:41:16,659
really came across the yellow stuff

2597
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,119
myself at least when I didn't make it

2598
01:41:16,659 --> 01:41:21,519
but um yeah it's certainly an

2599
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:22,960
interesting one too if you were to look

2600
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,790
at the differences I've never tried

2601
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,230
ayahuasca personally and that's that's

2602
01:41:24,789 --> 01:41:27,399
the one I'm most excited to try because

2603
01:41:26,229 --> 01:41:28,899
a lot of people say you know it's quite

2604
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:30,699
different to smoking it which is more

2605
01:41:28,899 --> 01:41:32,529
you know what you're intense kind like

2606
01:41:30,699 --> 01:41:34,989
akin to a bong here versus inedible you

2607
01:41:32,529 --> 01:41:37,000
know yeah yeah and it's much longer I

2608
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:38,949
mean and I mean there's so many ways now

2609
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,390
people to do are like you can do like an

2610
01:41:38,949 --> 01:41:43,800
ayahuasca analogue you know like a

2611
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:47,860
Syrian room mushroom mixture or you know

2612
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:49,750
the most hostile is Syrian rule

2613
01:41:47,859 --> 01:41:51,009
so many ways to kind of emulate or even

2614
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:53,350
with research chemicals now they're

2615
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:55,210
emulating like ayahuasca type compounds

2616
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:58,619
and they even think some of the the most

2617
01:41:55,210 --> 01:42:03,789
ancient some soma compounds were like

2618
01:41:58,618 --> 01:42:06,460
were different in beta Hart karma

2619
01:42:03,789 --> 01:42:08,590
beta-carbolines and like DMT sources I

2620
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:10,139
mean it's such an ancient alchemical

2621
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:12,909
science but yeah I think you would enjoy

2622
01:42:10,139 --> 01:42:14,560
ayahuasca but I would say maybe do it in

2623
01:42:12,908 --> 01:42:18,309
its natural environment maybe get down

2624
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,900
into the jungles and really or that or

2625
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:23,590
do it in someplace that that is in

2626
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:24,729
nature yeah I've heard that above all of

2627
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:26,650
other things you know like sentence

2628
01:42:24,729 --> 01:42:29,349
setting is the most important thing with

2629
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:30,939
ayahuasca because for a lot of reasons

2630
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:32,050
but it is very much a ritual it's no I

2631
01:42:30,939 --> 01:42:33,579
don't think there's many people who

2632
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:36,429
would say that it's purely recreational

2633
01:42:33,579 --> 01:42:38,229
oh yeah it's not recreational at all

2634
01:42:36,429 --> 01:42:39,940
it's very it's very hard on your system

2635
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:42,039
I mean you're you're you're vomiting a

2636
01:42:39,939 --> 01:42:44,138
lot I mean that's kind of what I did my

2637
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:46,359
research thesis on ayahuasca shamanism

2638
01:42:44,139 --> 01:42:49,449
and the Amazon when when I was in the

2639
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:51,759
university so it's like I had to do some

2640
01:42:49,448 --> 01:42:53,289
grueling stuff and it's yeah it's I

2641
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,360
always tell people it's like you know

2642
01:42:53,289 --> 01:42:57,579
now we have a lot of this well if you do

2643
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,079
yoga and if you go to festivals yeah you

2644
01:42:57,579 --> 01:43:02,618
gotta try how I wast gets become like

2645
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:05,139
the it's kind of a like like cool person

2646
01:43:02,618 --> 01:43:07,118
rite of passage if you're like hip but

2647
01:43:05,139 --> 01:43:09,190
really you know the key to ayahuasca is

2648
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:12,179
like it's there to eat you're either

2649
01:43:09,189 --> 01:43:15,189
there to be healed learn to be a healer

2650
01:43:12,179 --> 01:43:16,600
I think those are really the only two

2651
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:18,009
things that people should be using for

2652
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:20,199
it is if you're learning to be a healer

2653
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:21,940
in Iowa's Cairo or if you're there to be

2654
01:43:20,198 --> 01:43:23,559
healed I mean I always tell people they

2655
01:43:21,939 --> 01:43:25,599
should take like an interview with it

2656
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:28,150
like a first everybody should interview

2657
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,730
with it like you at least do it once and

2658
01:43:28,149 --> 01:43:32,138
so that it can impart its knowledge and

2659
01:43:30,729 --> 01:43:33,549
kind of check you out and you can check

2660
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:35,739
it out but I don't it's not a

2661
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:37,090
recreational thing but I think it's

2662
01:43:35,738 --> 01:43:39,099
something kind of like Burning Man you

2663
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:40,270
should always you know you should you

2664
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,829
should do it once

2665
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:43,510
kind of like a Eclipse you should see a

2666
01:43:41,829 --> 01:43:44,889
total solar eclipse there's things in

2667
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:49,239
life that I think everybody should try

2668
01:43:44,889 --> 01:43:51,130
and yeah probably one of them so my

2669
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:52,539
question I'm really interested to ask is

2670
01:43:51,130 --> 01:43:55,449
out of all the countries you've been to

2671
01:43:52,539 --> 01:43:57,579
which one is left the most positive you

2672
01:43:55,448 --> 01:44:00,368
know kind of impact on you you know but

2673
01:43:57,579 --> 01:44:01,539
in terms of both you know things you're

2674
01:44:00,368 --> 01:44:03,909
doing in the country we're going to

2675
01:44:01,539 --> 01:44:05,560
so whether that be good stuff there or

2676
01:44:03,909 --> 01:44:08,139
whether you're able to good sense good

2677
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:10,000
stuff back or just you know like a

2678
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:11,980
combination of that as well as you know

2679
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,630
like just you enjoy the place nice

2680
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:16,689
people good food you know well that type

2681
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:18,789
of good stuff yeah I mean number one the

2682
01:44:16,689 --> 01:44:20,529
Himalayas artists I can't get enough of

2683
01:44:18,789 --> 01:44:22,569
it I love the people I love the place I

2684
01:44:20,529 --> 01:44:25,689
love the culture I mean the food

2685
01:44:22,569 --> 01:44:28,719
Nepali food isn't that great but it's a

2686
01:44:25,689 --> 01:44:31,349
stall but but it's very nutritious just

2687
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:34,240
being up there like just walking those

2688
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:36,039
you know there's these I don't know it's

2689
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:38,289
hard to explain like for backpacking and

2690
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:40,930
trekking the beauty of the Himalayan

2691
01:44:38,289 --> 01:44:45,489
trickiness you're basically walking

2692
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:47,230
along the these trails or that have been

2693
01:44:45,489 --> 01:44:48,909
there for thousands of years that have

2694
01:44:47,229 --> 01:44:51,069
gone there go all through the Himalayas

2695
01:44:48,909 --> 01:44:53,199
back when you know and they all connect

2696
01:44:51,069 --> 01:44:55,359
to town so there's always like a little

2697
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:57,010
village about five hours each village is

2698
01:44:55,359 --> 01:45:00,309
about five hours from each other so you

2699
01:44:57,010 --> 01:45:02,380
can you can always stay out in the cold

2700
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:04,539
you never have to pack like a sleeping

2701
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:07,300
bag you never have to have food you can

2702
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:09,519
just smoke enjoy the beauty and water

2703
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:10,659
and then walk to the next town drink

2704
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,610
some tea you can spend the night if you

2705
01:45:10,659 --> 01:45:15,729
want or you can keep on walking like I

2706
01:45:12,609 --> 01:45:16,809
just I just love the Himalayas but you

2707
01:45:15,729 --> 01:45:18,609
know second runner up

2708
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,230
there's something about Guatemala that I

2709
01:45:18,609 --> 01:45:22,479
love so much maybe it's the first place

2710
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:24,339
I fell in love with or maybe it's that

2711
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:26,199
there there's still such an indigenous

2712
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:28,750
presence like it still has such it's

2713
01:45:26,199 --> 01:45:32,369
beautiful culture and it has the ocean

2714
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:34,960
you know as a Pacific it has the

2715
01:45:32,369 --> 01:45:37,689
Atlantic it I mean the Caribbean there

2716
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,909
it has mountains it has it has

2717
01:45:37,689 --> 01:45:42,609
everything and it people are friendly

2718
01:45:39,909 --> 01:45:46,180
it's it's a beautiful place I mean those

2719
01:45:42,609 --> 01:45:47,559
are probably the top two Oleson it

2720
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:50,530
sounds like two plays I need to go yeah

2721
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:52,750
yeah you definitely need to go you know

2722
01:45:50,529 --> 01:45:54,670
what I would love to gives people some

2723
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:56,170
information on things if they want to go

2724
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:58,029
deeper into kind of some of the things

2725
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:59,560
I've talked about like maybe some books

2726
01:45:58,029 --> 01:46:03,519
that are a good starter books or people

2727
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:05,760
looking so I would highly recommend if

2728
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:09,100
anybody's interested in just more of a

2729
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:12,909
reading with your heart look into any of

2730
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:15,340
Stephen Bruner's books or our interviews

2731
01:46:12,909 --> 01:46:17,349
like he is definitely connected

2732
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:19,810
that style of interacting with plants

2733
01:46:17,349 --> 01:46:21,940
with your heart a great book that's

2734
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:23,789
always fun plants of the Gods richard

2735
01:46:21,939 --> 01:46:27,729
evans lt's albert hofmann

awesome guys excellent book if you want

2737
01:46:27,729 --> 01:46:32,979
more of a lighter more meditative

2738
01:46:30,698 --> 01:46:35,529
approach to connecting with plants I

2739
01:46:32,979 --> 01:46:39,698
would say anything by Elliot Cohen like

2740
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:41,710
plant spirit medicine definitely if you

2741
01:46:39,698 --> 01:46:43,960
torrent or anything like that

2742
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:45,849
find someplace that has all the terence

2743
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:47,469
mckenna's interviews like on one little

2744
01:46:45,849 --> 01:46:49,389
thing it's probably like a million gigs

2745
01:46:47,469 --> 01:46:51,698
and download every single turns but kind

2746
01:46:49,389 --> 01:46:53,260
of interview you can ever get and just

2747
01:46:51,698 --> 01:46:57,069
listen to those he is the most ultimate

2748
01:46:53,260 --> 01:47:01,090
dude on earth christian rat Jonathan odd

2749
01:46:57,069 --> 01:47:03,039
I mean Wade Davis mark Plotkin Timothy

2750
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:05,920
Plowman all these ethno botanist these

2751
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:08,229
are kind of like these are my heroes and

2752
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:13,658
I I really think people would benefit

2753
01:47:08,229 --> 01:47:15,689
from that trying to think any other you

2754
01:47:13,658 --> 01:47:19,238
know support erowid

2755
01:47:15,689 --> 01:47:21,039
it sites just I'm sure I think of things

2756
01:47:19,238 --> 01:47:25,379
that are just so oh you know it's a

2757
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:30,819
great book people I'm not you know I my

2758
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:33,699
degree was in basically kind of like it

2759
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:35,649
was a anthropology religion with

2760
01:47:33,698 --> 01:47:37,509
emphasis on plants and culture and

2761
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:39,519
religion so I always wanted to be

2762
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:42,460
nothing botanist but I could never

2763
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:44,920
handle the botany in the science nor the

2764
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:46,569
you know the put you in a box thing so I

2765
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:49,029
kind of found it found a way around it

2766
01:47:46,569 --> 01:47:51,158
and did ethnobotany without the botany

2767
01:47:49,029 --> 01:47:52,689
but there if there is one book that

2768
01:47:51,158 --> 01:47:54,420
people if people are kind of like a

2769
01:47:52,689 --> 01:47:57,460
dummy like me and are more artist

2770
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:58,569
artistic and don't want to try and

2771
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:00,730
figure everything out there's a great

2772
01:47:58,569 --> 01:48:03,549
book called it's called like practical

2773
01:48:00,729 --> 01:48:06,218

2774
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:07,539
Josh and it's got pictures and it talked

2775

01:48:13,179 --> 01:48:18,699
botany for dummies it has great things

2780
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:20,469
about all the classical breeders let me

2781
01:48:18,698 --> 01:48:22,988
think anyone else that I think is super

2782
01:48:20,469 --> 01:48:24,310
awesome definitely read Stephen Bruner's

2783
01:48:22,988 --> 01:48:27,519
books plants of the gods

2784
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:28,330
oh and Luther Burbank if you want to

2785
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,060
know of a cool

2786
01:48:28,329 --> 01:48:33,880
honest that's still connected to its

2787
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:35,200
heart and to the spirit definitely

2788
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:38,369
getting to Luther Burbank one of the

2789
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:41,470
most amazing breeders on earth ever

2790
01:48:38,369 --> 01:48:44,680
created I think like 800 different kinds

2791
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:46,930
of fruits and vegetables well from Santa

2792
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:48,460
Rosa it's he has amazing quotes like his

2793
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:49,990
I think one of his famous quotes is like

2794
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:53,770
the most important thing to a breeding

2795
01:48:49,989 --> 01:48:56,829
program is love he's um was another one

2796
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:59,830
of the thing is oh that I don't know but

2797
01:48:56,829 --> 01:49:01,630
if you're into botany and you still want

2798
01:48:59,829 --> 01:49:05,710
to be kind of groovy and esoteric

2799
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:07,569
definitely for Burbank and travel please

2800
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:11,380
travel please collect seeds please make

2801

to everyone let's make this an awesome

2803
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:19,600
community and let's really push this

2804
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:22,240
thing into amazing directions I think

2805
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:26,860
that's it yeah I mean that sounds

2806
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:28,539
amazing and very very good again you

2807
01:49:26,859 --> 01:49:30,789
know very archetypal of body just

2808
01:49:28,539 --> 01:49:31,390
spreading the love yeah I mean that's

2809
01:49:30,789 --> 01:49:34,689
what it's all about

2810
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:37,690
I mean I I'm I guess i always get shy

2811
01:49:34,689 --> 01:49:40,449
and i get all paranoid about about these

2812
01:49:37,689 --> 01:49:41,710
conversations but really if it's with

2813
01:49:40,449 --> 01:49:45,010
good people it's just you're just

2814
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:46,359
talking so i got i think you know adam

2815
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:48,250
densha was different it was live and

2816
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:50,529
there's a lot going on and that was

2817
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,420
iLike that I like live because you know

2818
01:49:50,529 --> 01:49:54,729
it's raw but this is nice too because

2819
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:56,500
you get to really kind of like um you

2820
01:49:54,729 --> 01:49:59,549
get to talk more and like really kind of

2821
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:03,100
come from somewhere I wanna talk about

2822
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:05,440
yeah I mean that's that's one of the

2823
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:07,150
things we often hear about what people

2824
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:08,619
enjoy about this show is that people are

2825
01:50:07,149 --> 01:50:11,049
able to kind of get a bit deeper into

2826
01:50:08,619 --> 01:50:12,640
their the Lots on an issue and not just

2827
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:15,579
kind of maybe moving on to the next

2828
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:17,440
issue straight away mm-hmm yeah I mean I

2829
01:50:15,579 --> 01:50:19,750
definitely like the dynamic approach and

2830
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:23,500
I like how it yeah it's just it's

2831
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:25,359
different it's more one is more like

2832
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:27,100
it's more of a show and you're on the

2833
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:28,479
spot and you're really getting out and

2834
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,000
then this one's more of kind of like a

2835
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:32,769
you're like having tea so I they both

2836
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,020
are amazing they both serve their

2837
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:37,390
purpose but you know it's neat to have

2838
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:39,310
both sides of the coin I think you know

2839
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:41,719
you you know you're kind of like is the

2840
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:45,139
nard waar of cannabis

2841
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:46,880
interviews you know nerd war yeah he's

2842
01:50:45,139 --> 01:50:48,409
like the crazy interviewer like he comes

2843
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,909
up with all the wackiest questions and

2844
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:51,948
all the guys are like where the hell did

2845
01:50:49,908 --> 01:50:55,038
you figure that out you'd be like the

2846
01:50:51,948 --> 01:50:57,168
nard whare of cannabis podcasts I love

2847
01:50:55,038 --> 01:50:59,149
it you know doing these and honestly

2848
01:50:57,168 --> 01:51:00,948
what I say to everyone is I just I just

2849
01:50:59,149 --> 01:51:03,228
make this show that I wish already

2850
01:51:00,948 --> 01:51:06,558
existed like I'm just making a show that

2851
01:51:03,229 --> 01:51:08,360
I would sit down and enjoy yeah I hope

2852
01:51:06,559 --> 01:51:10,189
this makes a lot of people happy cuz

2853
01:51:08,359 --> 01:51:12,768
everybody's like you know it's I guess

2854
01:51:10,189 --> 01:51:14,570
it's nice to hear someone's voice and

2855
01:51:12,769 --> 01:51:16,340
just you know I hope I just got across

2856
01:51:14,569 --> 01:51:18,319
some dinner my whole thing was I just

2857
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:21,469
wanted people to maybe see a different a

2858
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:24,228
different reality of how we can make

2859
01:51:21,469 --> 01:51:26,840
this work I hope that it kind of comes

2860
01:51:24,229 --> 01:51:28,309
through in the interview yeah I think

2861
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:30,078
that they would definitely we'll have

2862
01:51:28,309 --> 01:51:31,880
that experience and honestly it's

2863
01:51:30,078 --> 01:51:33,558
something that has kind of been

2864
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,090
necessary in a way because a lot of the

2865
01:51:33,559 --> 01:51:36,559
a lot of breeders do and including

2866
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:38,179
myself you know do approach this very

2867
01:51:36,559 --> 01:51:39,260
much from that scientific point of view

2868
01:51:38,179 --> 01:51:41,989
so it's really nice to have that

2869
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:45,110
contrast and kind of juxtaposition to

2870
