let's get into it foreign

54
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,840
[Music]

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,219
that is a question for the ages and I

56
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,378
mean what a what a brilliant answer as

57
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,239
to how to sort of work a line I think

58
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,039
everyone including myself will need to

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,739
re-listen to that once or twice because

60
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,679
it was just gold in there and uh

61
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,560
speaking of working a line I've always

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,439
been very fond since being able to try

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,780
your cherry pie S1 I think that's got to

64
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,280
be one of the most intoxicating flavor

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,098
profiles there is so I've always

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,500
followed the Cherry West and just in

67
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,119
general your cherry work and I see that

68
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
there's a lot of really cool projects

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,959
you've been doing be it like you know

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,360
the Cherry West back cross

71
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,300
um you're doing the collab with uh

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,920
biovortex the Cherry Lime dog we were

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,780
chatting to him with about that and that

74
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,598
sounds great I even noticed that you did

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,060
a sunset sherbet cherry limeade cross

76
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,159
which is also cool did you have any

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,780
immediate plans for what you want to

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,219
kind of do with your cherry lines any

79
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,959
ideas where you want to go in the future

80
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,939
because I know a lot of people Beyond

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,239
Myself are really into them and follow

82
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,239
it

83
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,400
I have some different things that I've

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,439
done I mean I even this year I took a

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,959
you know the lime and the cherry limeade

86
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,199
is the PK black lime

87
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,959
um which was the brother of the lime one

88
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,179
so when I made the cherry limeade

89
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,560
without mail I also put that

90
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,260
on the live one and then I have various

91
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,319
lime lines that come out of that that I

92
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,158
just call a lime instead of black lime

93
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,280
um

94
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:53,158
and so this year I took a lime a really

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,919
nice lime F5

96
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,919
and I put that on the Cherry clone again

97
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,500
to remake a cherry limeade

98
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,359
F1 which is the same thing I did to make

99
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,060
the Cherry Lime pop which was when I

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,480
used the lime Pop Mail which was a lime

101
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,400
F2 instead of an F5

102
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,280
um and that's what that's what uh

103
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,560
biovortex started with for his project

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,120
and

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,699
um so I went ahead and did a different

106
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,978
one and

107
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,800
it'll be a little bit different because

108
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,659
you know the lime pop was what it was in

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,620
the mail I used this time is what it was

110
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,740
and the F1 lime male that I used to make

111
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,300
cherry limeade was was its thing

112
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,579
um every time you do that you pick a

113
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,220
different male of the same strain and

114
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,918
you put it on the same mother you get a

115
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,320
completely different cross it's not a

116
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,120
you know it's not just like you take

117
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,680
lime and Cherry you cross them together

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,899
and you get the same thing every time

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,780
you use a different male you get a

120
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,679
completely new thing with some of the

121
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,939
same

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,780
um traits so I went ahead and I did that

123
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,939
um I did a lot of cherry lime

124
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:08,459
cross gelato

125
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,300
um gelato 33

126
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,638
.

127
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,439
um I liked that one it seemed kind of

128
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,000
silly when I made it but I tried it and

129
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,680
then once I grew them I was like wow

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,839
this really worked out nice because it

131
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,819
was they had really pretty color which

132
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,799
you know who cares but still they're

133
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,779
pretty and nice

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,060
um it made it a little bit more

135
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,099
substantial and dense than a lot of the

136
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,379
Cherry limeades even though the cherry

137
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,199
limeade has that in it they're not all

138
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,000
super heavy and dense

139
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,860
um and easy to trim but the gelato

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,339
really brought that to it the cherry

141
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,259
limeade still kept a lot of its Terps in

142
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,538
there that really popped out and made it

143
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,780
sharp whereas gelato is more kind of

144
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:51,779
like a kind of the 33 is kind of like a

145
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,459
fruit loopy ice cream thing

146
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,459
um

147
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:58,079
and then so I took that and I did that

148
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,819
on a lot of stuff I took the cherry

149
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,279
limeade gelato I put it on the Cherry

150
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,978
mom again so that'll reinforce that

151
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,918
cheriness but the lime will start to get

152
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:09,538
lost a little I like the lime in those

153
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,560
CR and the cherry limeade crosses

154
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,800
because it brings some of that

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,418
citronella lemongrass lime peel

156
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,340
um kind of stuff which the Cherry

157
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:21,659
already had some of it but it's more

158
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:24,359
like Star more like lemon Starburst uh

159
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,960
candy kind of a thing

160
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,780
um

161
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:32,519
and then

162
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:34,679
the Cherry so the Cherry the Cherry West

163
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,198
back cross was cherry limeade cross

164
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,720
Cherry West Cross Cherry West

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,879
then that male got put on the Cherry

166
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,060
West again and then out of that that got

167
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:48,478
put on the Cherry West again so I have

168
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,478
quite a few seeds now of the Cherry West

169
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,699
bat cross three instead of one which was

170
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,219
the last release

171
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,800
um

172
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,759
and those are cool

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
um

174
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,020
and I'll probably come out of that and

175
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,360
go back to it again which is eventually

176
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,698
just kind of making the Cherry West

177
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:14,000
clone by itself

178
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:14,000
and you know you could have taken

179
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,519
um

180
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,020
Cherry West the original males from that

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,460
seed and put it on the Clone and taken

182
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,339
those forward

183
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:31,079
except the cherry limeade

184
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:33,418
I liked better in the cross because it

185
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,198
had more of the crazy

186
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:40,318
far out Terps that the Cherry West 10

187
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,120
clone had whereas a lot of the sisters

188
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,340
of the Cherry West 10 and the Cherry

189
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,639
West Cross they were more of a plain

190
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:49,799
cherry pie thing and uh like regular

191
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,840
Cherry Pie and as exotic as regular

192
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,379
Cherry Pie as and people really like it

193
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,339
it's not like the Cherry Pie weirdo that

194
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:01,620
I have from clone which is a lot more

195
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:05,339
rose oil and uh

196
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,060
that Starburst candy thing going on

197
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,538
um

198
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,800
so I I like to you I like to use that to

199
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:16,019
lock down the cherry West in seed form

200
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,680
um the cherry limeade instead because

201
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:22,079
the males I feel like

202
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,740
um the Cherry West 10 was kind of like a

203
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,180
one in whatever 50 throw and the rest

204
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,400
some of the rest were a little more

205
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,620
dumbed down regular

206
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,958
um cherry pie Terps which are a little

207
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,200
more musky and deep and dark

208
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,299
which are cool and tasty but

209
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,879
not the unique thing I was trying to

210
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,699
bring out of both those things and so I

211
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,600
liked the cherry lime

212
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,240
um

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
better as a starting place for that so

214
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,379
that's what I've been doing with that

215
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,679
and then so I'll probably put out like I

216
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:57,059
might put out some cherry West bat cross

217
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,120
three

218
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:03,659
I might just wait and put out the back

219
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,539
Cross Four or the back cross

220
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,458
that cross one f2s or the back cross

221
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,259
three F twos just depending you know

222
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,479
we'll try them and see which ones kinda

223
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,000
are the coolest or you know do them all

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
if they're all really cool and different

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,720
um

226
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,120
and so there's that and what you saw was

227
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
the Cherry West back crops those were

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,778
different ones what we smoked when you

229
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,860
were here

230
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:27,480
um

231
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,919
and that was funny because we kind of

232
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,360
took the one we thought was the worst

233
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,338
and we smoked that and I was like [ __ ]

234
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,839
this shit's still good I thought you

235
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,880
guys wouldn't even be that stoned

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
because you had a heavy tolerance and I

237
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,080
didn't as much and then I was sitting

238
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,000
there super ripped and I was like look

239
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm probably the only one high here and

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,220
then you guys were like dude that's

241
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,600
Stoney and I said all right cool cool

242
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,980
good to see you you know like out of

243
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,980
that since it was the one that didn't

244
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,879
look like it was the the best you know

245
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,459
um

246
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,799
but uh so there's those

247
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,439
and then

248
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,299
I did you know I kind of I want to find

249
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,540
like a cherry limeade that can actually

250
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:11,639
make like water hash bubble hash because

251
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:12,360
it is so greasy you can only really make

252
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,939
um

253
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,500
you can really only make oil with like

254
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,700
butane uh or CO2 and it just doesn't I

255
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,799
don't know like it

256
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,940
I

257
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,919
um

258
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,200
I want to see it I want to see the same

259
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,719
Terps on a more solid resin head so that

260
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,700
you can do different stuff with it so I

261
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,360
crossed it like with with Chrome's white

262
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:39,480
and I crossed it with Katsu babakush

263
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,539
uh and I crossed it with black dog and I

264
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,379
crossed it with purple snow Bubba from

265
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:48,120
CSI and that's in an attempt to see if I

266
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,120
can go in a direction where I get the

267
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,639
cherry limeade Terps on

268
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,679
um a more solid

269
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,799
uh

270
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,799
resin so we'll see if that works out

271
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,079
um

272
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,500
and uh

273
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,579
so

274
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,839
yeah man

275
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:15,239
um I'm trying to think if there's other

276
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,100
stuff I did but those I think that's

277
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,778
kind of what what I really have going

278
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,180
now and then of course

279
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,379
uh I did cherry limeade cross with the

280
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:25,139
Cherry

281
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,259
clone again so I took the F5 cherry

282
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:30,000
limeade and put that on the Cherry clone

283
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:31,679
and I was watching Game of Thrones and

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,679
they had the guy who was the fire guy

285
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,958
and they called him the pyromancer and I

286
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,659
was like ooh cherry pie romancer that's

287
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,819
a cherry pie cherry pie romancer I'm

288
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,740
gonna [ __ ] call it that so I slapped

289
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,079
that on it because I knew I knew it came

290
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,000
out of a funny it's hard to name things

291
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,219
you know

292
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,778
um but uh but also you know that's a

293
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,180
funny thing because it's fire and

294
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,320
there's pie in there and you know

295
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,120
whatever

296
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,740
um so that was like one thing that I

297
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,139
have and I'm gonna keep working on that

298
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,919
and

299
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,860
um

300
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,500
other Cherry stuff cherry limeade I have

301
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,740
a lot of f6s that I need to go through

302
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,458
different directions I'm gonna go back

303
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:17,579
to the oldest ones

304
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:19,458
um while they're still viable so I can

305
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:22,019
make lots of them to put into storage

306
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:23,759
that's always important even if you kind

307
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,078
of successful with your newer ones you

308
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,879
don't want to abandon the old ones

309
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,099
because that's where you found the good

310
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,958
[ __ ] you know in the first place

311
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,139
so you got to make more of those before

312
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,219
they get old and maybe find new crazy

313
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,500
things

314
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,360
I got the wild strawberry clone I got

315
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,059
one I call Cherry Lime four from back

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,100
because that was Cherry Lime four which

317
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:48,179
was my original F1 keeper of cherry

318
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,339
limeade and then I hit that with seeds

319
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,078
from in it

320
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,300
so

321
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,399
um it was a back cross and then when I

322
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,879
popped those I got one that just has the

323
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:04,379
craziest Terps and it got some balls in

324
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,240
my depth but it didn't seed itself so

325
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,039
hope you know I'm doing a bunch of

326
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,480
crosses with that and seeing if I can

327
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,299
kind of get that to go in a direction

328
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,200
where it'll straighten out and

329
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,699
um

330
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,320
that one's like really really crazy

331
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,180
lemongrass it's hard to describe

332
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,860
citronella

333
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,778
chemical

334
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,659
with some of the Starbursts from the

335
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,220
Cherry but mostly just very limey but

336
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,578
the special part of the Cherry without

337
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,560
any of the berry cherry smell to it so

338
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,120
that's cool and then I think that's kind

339
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,679
of you know

340
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,320
um

341
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,539
that's kind of where those where those

342
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,700
are at at this point is just kind of

343
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,919
like still hunting through and trying

344
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,500
different different stuff with foam I

345
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,620
always have different you know

346
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,039
outcrosses I did with them and um

347
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,740
you know there's there's a lot of a lot

348
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:01,458
of neat a lot of neat stuff that pops

349
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,459
out of those lines

350
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,278
yeah for sure I mean it sounds like

351
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,899
there's a variety of different Avenues

352
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,240
people can go down if they're interested

353
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,940
in exploring the the Cherry work there

354
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,278
and I I love that name the uh the Cherry

355
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,800
Pie romance so that's it's a nice little

356
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:20,039
pun I noticed in that question you

357
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,379
referenced uh having done some work with

358
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,419
gelato and I had picked up on that as

359
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,519
well looking through your Instagram and

360
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:30,000
I was wondering do you like the results

361
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:33,299
you see having used the gelato mother in

362
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,458
some crosses and does this give any sort

363
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:38,099
of credence to the idea that maybe some

364
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,899
of the hype boys one day will see a runs

365
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,778
across from Mean Gene

366
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,539
uh well I mean I took that gelato 33

367
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:50,100
cherry limeade

368
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:53,360
um and I grew it and then I got the

369
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,139
runts clone and I grew that

370
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
and

371
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,198
um

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,000
you know the runts when I grew it it

373
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,099
kind of had a cool shape to it where

374
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,659
there's a lot of Bud to it and then the

375
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,060
leaves kind of separate it looked a lot

376
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,559
like my old dirt perp

377
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,198
and

378
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:17,338
I lost that years ago kind of a narrow

379
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:19,319
Bud that wants to kind of hug itself

380
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,079
and when you take the Leafs off of it

381
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,480
it's just kind of the bud left there and

382
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,179
it's not hairy

383
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,639
um

384
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:31,979
and uh it had really pretty color even

385
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,940
in the middle of the summer I liked the

386
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,339
smell

387
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,040
I mean of course now everybody knows

388
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,920
gelato everybody knows Skittles but I'm

389
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,599
of the opinion that if we would have had

390
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,958
all the same

391
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,459
quote unquote hype [ __ ] in the mid 90s

392
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,799
we would have been like this is good

393
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,599
this is like uh so-and-so's [ __ ] you

394
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,740
know like nah that's cool I like it you

395
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,399
know

396
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,480
um I feel like any time you win

397
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,179
um

398
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,680
everybody says you're full of [ __ ]

399
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,698
so

400
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:08,039
there's like an aspect of Underdog stuff

401
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,299
that happens where as soon as the strain

402
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,338
is popular

403
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,799
it's really hard for people to not say

404
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,620
it's [ __ ]

405
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:19,019
um I feel like like chem dog maybe and

406
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,320
OG have been able to kind of

407
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,240
be big and popular

408
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,879
purely for the reason that they're like

409
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,860
straight up probably the most knock you

410
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,179
in the head [ __ ] that anybody has access

411
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,899
to

412
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:36,179
so anybody who's really into those sees

413
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,360
anything that's not as potent

414
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,578
and because ah that shit's [ __ ] like

415
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
if you smoke the most potent weed all

416
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:45,958
the time anything that's not the most

417
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,579
potent weed doesn't really do much to

418
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,619
you

419
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:52,019
um

420
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,940
so you know it's kind of weird like for

421
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,339
me I'm like well I don't really want to

422
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,740
just smoke one kind of weed so I don't

423
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:02,579
even really want to smoke chemd chem 91

424
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,899
and ghost OG every day all day all the

425
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,938
time because then when I smoke other

426
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,380
[ __ ] I won't really get high we went

427
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,199
through the same thing when we started

428
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,120
smoking hash all the time and then we'd

429
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,039
smoke a joint we'd be like I'm [ __ ]

430
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,779
just don't even bother let's just smoke

431
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,599
some [ __ ] hash because this isn't

432
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,058
doing nothing to us and so I kind of

433
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,159
like to keep what I'm smoking varied and

434
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:25,318
then that way when I smoke something

435
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,480
that's super potent I really get [ __ ]

436
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,918
ripped and it's like I can notice it

437
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,140
otherwise

438
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,259
don't get me wrong I've smoked the most

439
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,020
potent [ __ ] every day all day

440
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:38,400
um that I have available after a certain

441
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:41,099
point

442
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,440
every time you smoke you don't really

443
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,418
get high anyway and then you you kind of

444
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,519
go oh this is the one thing that no

445
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:50,520
matter what it gets me high every time

446
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,918
but it's like yeah kinda but not like

447
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,720
you would be if you smoked Urkel for a

448
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,660
week and then you smoked some [ __ ] OG

449
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,660
or chem 91 or chemd then you'd be like

450
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,558
oh [ __ ] okay I'm [ __ ] Rich so like I

451
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,740
like to

452
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,960
I like to switch [ __ ] up and even you

453
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,880
know beyond the high of everything like

454
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,700
I don't like to taste the same weed

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,740
every time there's only a couple kinds

456
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,538
of weed that I like so much because I

457
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,880
just they make me happy and I like how

458
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:19,679
they taste that I like get really into

459
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,520
them where I want to smoke them all the

460
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,380
time

461
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,019
so

462
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,080
I like to have like you know I don't

463
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:31,379
mind that there's a ruts or a gelato or

464
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,619
a cherry pie or whatever it is because

465
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,360
for me it's like those are you know all

466
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,379
these different things that to me are

467
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:43,558
pretty good and then they are something

468
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,400
different you know like I I [ __ ] I

469
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,359
love

470
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,500
you know pizza or burgers and fries or

471
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,959
sushi or [ __ ] you know whatever nice

472
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,759
light Thai food Japanese food whatever

473
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,380
it is

474
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,538
um and there might be something that I

475
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,520
like better than everything else or only

476
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:05,400
two things but I don't really want to

477
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,980
eat that [ __ ] every single day I really

478
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,840
like that I got access to a lot of

479
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,940
different things it's like my favorite

480
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,918
song I don't want to just listen to it

481
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,779
all the time or pretty soon I'm like all

482
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,860
right well it's kind of played out and

483
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:22,319
you know it just I just the way you know

484
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:24,178
I think of [ __ ] so

485
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,480
um I like all the variety and everything

486
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,559
so like you know yeah I got the runs I

487
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,259
[ __ ]

488
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,240
bread it with the gelato cherry limeade

489
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:34,259
we'll see if it's good

490
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,538
um

491
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,279
I bread it with the sky cuddler double

492
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:39,900
Kush because I thought that would be odd

493
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,839
and there might be stuff that comes out

494
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,179
of it that isn't like what a normal

495
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,038
runts cross would be because it's like a

496
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,679
cush that's a that's a that's kind of a

497
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:53,038
weird Kush with

498
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:57,179
um a runt so I'm like okay we'll be kind

499
00:19:53,038 --> 00:20:00,000
of neat if you get like a gnarly Stony

500
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,400
OG Bud that smells a little bit like

501
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,679
gelato or something or something that

502
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,419
you wouldn't it unlocks something that

503
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,660
you didn't get out of either parent so

504
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,500
you know I tried it see what they do

505
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,380
um

506
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,759
but um I've always done that like if

507
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,400
there's something that people say is

508
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,019
really good and like I have friends who

509
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,700
grow it and they're like oh no dude it's

510
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,379
good I'm like yeah it's not just [ __ ]

511
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,480
it's not just some [ __ ] that that's

512
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,919
popular but no like I like to smoke it

513
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,419
if one of my friends says like they're

514
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,120
into it I'm like cool

515
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,320
I get it I make some crosses and if

516
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,298
they're good they're good and if not

517
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,859
they just go in a [ __ ] pile with all

518
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:38,038
the other [ __ ] I never do anything with

519
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:40,139
you know I I do it every uh

520
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,579
you know I do it every year whatever is

521
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,140
something that's around that people say

522
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:44,759
is cool I'm like huh I wonder how it

523
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,360
breeds I wonder how it looks I wonder

524
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,460
what it looks like when I grow it

525
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,798
um or when I you know like what's what's

526
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,279
it like the way I dry it or handle it

527
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:59,220
like is it good is it not good like you

528
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,178
know let's see what it does because

529
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,759
um

530
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:06,059
you know originally like I didn't I

531
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:09,359
didn't like OG and we even had types of

532
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:11,220
weed that were so similar to OG back in

533
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,379
the old days and we were like I don't

534
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,579
know you smoke it it's really [ __ ]

535
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,620
strong

536
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:20,159
you don't really feel that good you just

537
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:22,379
feel really [ __ ] stoned

538
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,419
um you don't get Giggles you don't

539
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,580
really get any kind of

540
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,220
you know like it doesn't give you a lift

541
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:31,918
you just it's [ __ ] holy [ __ ] that's

542
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,960
potent and we didn't really ever like it

543
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,720
and then that became really um popular

544
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,579
and then I started smoking tons of

545
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,159
[ __ ] weed and then all of a sudden it

546
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:44,399
was like okay this this shit's good and

547
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:47,280
then I liked those kinds of weed but um

548
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,679
you know what one person likes isn't or

549
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,139
doesn't mean that's the best for

550
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,380
everybody you know so I like to try to

551
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,940
keep everything going and

552
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,740
um make something out of stuff when it

553
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,659
comes around if I think it's good and

554
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,419
especially like if it does good in like

555
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:05,460
blind competitions with real heads you

556
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,038
know like the ego Clash or the emerald

557
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,779
cup or whatever where people don't know

558
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:11,819
the name but everybody's like damn this

559
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:14,279
one's good I'm like well what is it it

560
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:16,500
can't be that [ __ ] bad if it's if

561
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,019
this is blind it ain't the it ain't the

562
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,359
mylar bag selling it to people in a jar

563
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,980
when there's no name on it you know

564
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,259
so um

565
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,319
you know it makes me makes me curious so

566
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,419
I I uh I do stuff with um

567
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,779
with everything you know I got agent

568
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:37,259
orange crosses I got runs crosses I got

569
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:39,899
[ __ ] big bud crosses I got

570
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:41,640
Northern Lights crosses Like You Name It

571
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,919
Whatever came around that at the time

572
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,960
was something that people thought were

573
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,759
cool and people who I respect thought it

574
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,400
was good dope I'm I [ __ ] hit it with

575
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,079
some pollen you know

576
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,940
that's a good philosophy to have for

577
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,439
sure and I'm sure all the hypebeasts

578
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,720
will be thrilled to hear that they're

579
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,659
going to be able to get the runs gelato

580
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,058
cherry limeade combo and the sky cuddler

581
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:06,240
one also sounds like it could be a cool

582
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:08,700
little um hybrid in the works there I

583
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,640
mean on that same topic of catering to

584
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,519
everyone I was so stoked to see that

585
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,500
you're getting some nice sativas in the

586
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,200
mix recently when I noticed that you put

587
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,159
up that post about having pollinated a

588
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,440
C5 plant you had and it got me thinking

589
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,780
are you planning on you know working or

590
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,779
maybe even releasing some of the uh

591
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,158
older sort of haze hybrids because I

592
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,899
think that although there are a lot of

593
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
people who say that they're super sick

594
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,640
of you know the Amsterdam profile like

595
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,380
that Meme you put up perfectly embodied

596
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,659
it where you were kind of alluding to

597
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,580
that you know there is a more nuanced

598
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:47,159
side of the haze terpenes which people

599
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:49,199
can sometimes discredit what's your

600
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,700
plans for this hybrid and do you want to

601
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
do some more sativa work going going

602
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,480
forward

603
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:57,839
you know the thing about sativas was for

604
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,179
me my thing was always I wanted to be

605
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,918
able to make plants

606
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:05,460
I wanted to be able to make seeds that

607
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,400
somebody that somebody like I'm a funny

608
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,798
person like that I don't I don't have a

609
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,340
whole lot of stuff that I like just for

610
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,319
the sake of me liking it I like to do

611
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,079
things

612
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:23,000
for other people's enjoyment

613
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:25,678
um like I really like to

614
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,558
make plants that I think someone else is

615
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,780
going to like to grow you know

616
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,359
um so I mean

617
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,579
I always kind of did stuff that I knew

618
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,859
like people because I didn't used to you

619
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,720
know be on the Internet or nobody knew

620
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,000
that I had anything I didn't know

621
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,700
anybody outside my little circle so it's

622
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,279
kind of like okay well I think so and so

623
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,779
you know they know this stuff and and we

624
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,519
all thought it was good so like I'm

625
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,079
gonna work on it and then you know see

626
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,480
if we can get some people to grow some

627
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,099
of this and that'll be fun to see them

628
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,960
and I don't want to make something

629
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,759
nobody's going to grow that I'm just

630
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,159
going to grow

631
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,658
um because you know that's kind of the

632
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,340
fun of it like you're gonna make music

633
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:07,320
you want to make music that people are

634
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:09,298
going to want to hear you want to make

635
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,678
food you want to make food that when you

636
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:12,418
feed people they'll think it's good food

637
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,259
you know

638
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,500
um

639
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:19,079
so like I always kind of just was doing

640
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,200
that and then at a certain point I

641
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:24,480
realized that I do like just for myself

642
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,759
I do really like the highs on some of

643
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,778
the sativa stuff like I had some swazi

644
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,819
and some stuff people gave me and

645
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:35,759
um way back in the day we had like a tie

646
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,500
that would completely like be like half

647
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,480
male half female that the weed was

648
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,179
really tasty on it and we'd say [ __ ] it

649
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,860
put you know one way over here and grow

650
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,679
them and have a you know a couple Joints

651
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:48,719
off a little plant or whatever and um

652
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,580
my buddy had some Mexican he brought

653
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,319
back from Mexico and grew back in the

654
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:54,178
day and I was like oh that's that's cool

655
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,939
but they grew terribly so I was just

656
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,400
like you know it's just a novelty

657
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,500
um but I I realized at a point okay I do

658
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,200
like to have a little bag of this swazi

659
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,119
or a little bag of whatever it is you

660
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,580
know

661
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:12,479
so you know I've grown some swazi some

662
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:14,519
Congolese and I I I I realize that you

663
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,500
don't have to grow plants

664
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,538
to have a crop

665
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,880
you can grow plants just to have one

666
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:24,538
little shitty plant in a little pot off

667
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,640
somewhere to the side and just take that

668
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:28,500
and you wind up with a little bag of

669
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,240
weed and every once in a while you're

670
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,400
like I'm gonna smoke the weird weed and

671
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,440
you take five bong hits of the really

672
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,480
weird weed with the high ceiling in here

673
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,400
really [ __ ] high and it's different

674
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,798
than anything else you know and it gives

675
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,419
you it gives you cool um

676
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,519
these are cool Vibes you're not just

677
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,679
smoking the same Afghani based stuff

678
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,658
that is is good for a lot of things but

679
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,538
doesn't necessarily give you the real

680
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,940
[ __ ] lift of being tripped out and

681
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:58,919
[ __ ] so um

682
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,720
you know I I got the C5 I got the A5 I

683
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,299
tried the weeds they both have a really

684
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,038
cool high the plant itself smells like

685
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:08,038
lemon peels which I think is [ __ ]

686
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:11,960
awesome but the bud really has that kind

687
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:14,339
of Amsterdam Haze when you have that

688
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,860
terpenoline like that and it's sharp and

689
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:19,859
like turpentiney and gnarly like so like

690
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:21,899
the like the Pakistani CSI has like

691
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:23,879
where it's more earthy too is a little

692
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,140
different but anyway so I you know I

693
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,820
went ahead and crossed it with stuff

694
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,520
that's really weird and there's a lot of

695
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,798
potential for different terpene profiles

696
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,418
and you know we'll see if it goes

697
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:35,639
anywhere I'm not going to have a lot of

698
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,419
those seeds but enough to try some out I

699
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,120
think

700
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:42,320
and uh I'm more interested in working

701
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:45,359
with like this Malawi I have and this uh

702
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:48,619
Congolese the Congolese is kind of in

703
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:52,139
that ballpark but it has more of a deep

704
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:53,879
grassy thing to it that

705
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,559
you would think you would like if you

706
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,000
don't like those types but then there's

707
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:59,220
something about it that's kind of just

708
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,259
nice and uh

709
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,579
they're neat they didn't have any Hermes

710
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,679
in them and they were straight from

711
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,019
straight from the Congo and like they

712
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,900
were they were good for that kind of a

713
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:13,139
like a land race heirloom

714
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,519
um African thing and uh really Hardy in

715
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,380
a lot of ways

716
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,619
it's like you know just I want to play

717
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,659
with some different things like that but

718
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:23,879
it's not the it's not the main Direction

719
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,580
I want to go but I really would like to

720
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,480
get my hands on the old Haze

721
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:33,778
type that I saw in the 90s where it was

722
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,538
just so tasty and it was more like

723
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:39,359
a

724
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:41,519
a I don't know like a I don't know

725
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,959
really hard to describe but more like

726
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,359
Cedar

727
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,079
incense

728
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,359
um

729
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,599
it's really really tasty like you're

730
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,038
just like damn that is so

731
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,639
enjoyable you know

732
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,440
um

733
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,419
more like how like

734
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,880
that's funny as it is like opium

735
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,559
straight off of a off of the head of a

736
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,140
poppy when you smoke that house just

737
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,879
you're just like wow some that's just

738
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,460
made to be smoked that's not like

739
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,020
smoking

740
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,700
weed that's like a whole different thing

741
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,980
you know which is what a lot of the best

742
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,740
weed weed strains are like that they're

743
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,240
just you can't believe it you know

744
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,099
um

745
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,919
so I'd like to dig into those kind of

746
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,939
things more the A5 and the C5 are really

747
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,360
famous

748
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:30,778
Neville you know like you can't downplay

749
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,918
his his legacy and you know like the

750
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:34,259
Northern Lights I was talking about

751
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,120
earlier probably was straight from

752
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,599
Neville based on the packaging and the

753
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:41,759
labeling and [ __ ] time frame the C5 was

754
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,278
really cold resistant really moisture

755
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,960
resistant that was neat

756
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,179
um the A5

757
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,340
has a taste that I like

758
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,620
you know everybody who's chasing those

759
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:55,220
as being really amazing like definitely

760
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:55,219
try them

761
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,440
yeah so a good answer there and I guess

762
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,299
as a follow-up kind of based on how you

763
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,058
said you'd love to get some like real

764
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:08,220
Hayes and maybe as a larger extension

765
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:10,440
this applies to the roadkill do you

766
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,079
think that there are really many if any

767
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,240
Growers who are shall we say like you

768
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:18,119
know hidden up away in the Hills or the

769
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,058
mountains still holding on to some super

770
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,339
old cultivar from Years Gone by and like

771
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:25,678
the you know late 80s or 90s or do you

772
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,538
think maybe not so likely because even

773
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,460
those people who are tucked away still

774
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:31,140
come into town every so often and they

775
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,179
get exposed to the new stuff and they

776
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,640
probably dropped it at some point

777
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,440
I think real heads have certain plants

778
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:42,000
that they're just in love with

779
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,798
and they keep them no matter what

780
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,599
and uh

781
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:47,538
you know they may be sharing with a

782
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,658
couple people who know how good they are

783
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:54,119
and I think that there's probably a lot

784
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:56,520
of stuff out there

785
00:30:54,119 --> 00:31:00,259
um that you'll never hear about because

786
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,259
I think in general

787
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:06,418
um you know like even me like I

788
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:09,720
sometimes I don't even understand why I

789
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:10,399
have any interest with like really

790
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,100
um

791
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:17,699
breeding and sharing seeds and like the

792
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:21,839
whole scene and you know I even you know

793
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:26,038
just the trying to trying to keep up

794
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:29,759
with the social interactions and the way

795
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,419
everything goes and

796
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,419
um

797
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,759
you know the whole scene which I'm

798
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:37,740
relatively new to compared to a lot of

799
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,898
people who have been more into it for a

800
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:47,480
long time like I had a certain

801
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:51,658
uh naivety uh with the whole scene like

802
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,700
you know initially like I met people who

803
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,559
were super into seeds and we're and I

804
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,840
was like oh I never you know I don't

805
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:00,240
know anybody who's really into that I my

806
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,398
friends are like hardcore

807
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,778
you know old school dope Growers who

808
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,459
they you know they get the good thing

809
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:07,619
here they get the good thing there maybe

810
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,659
they have something they make a little

811
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:12,239
seeds here and there and stuff and

812
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:14,159
whatnot and then there was people who

813
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,480
we're super into it and I was like whoa

814
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,399
these people are really into it and then

815
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,440
over time you realize well yeah the

816
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:23,099
reason why they're into it is because of

817
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:27,259
the way the scene is laid out where

818
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:31,319
you can manipulate people so heavily by

819
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:34,619
being Mr seed guy or

820
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:36,359
whatever little role that they're that

821
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,158
they're playing in the scene you know

822
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,178
and then after a while you're like oh

823
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,059
like

824
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:43,980
you know y'all don't even really

825
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:45,599
I don't even know if you really like any

826
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,620
of this [ __ ] like I don't know if you

827
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,298
have any

828
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:55,019
interest in the biology or the plant

829
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:57,298
aspect beyond the clout and

830
00:32:55,019 --> 00:33:00,839
all this other kind of [ __ ] that

831
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:03,720
like surrounds anything that is

832
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:07,859
you know an opportunity to gain any kind

833
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,839
of like that kind of energy like you

834
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:12,000
know there's some people who are really

835
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,158
they really love cars they grew up from

836
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,798
when they were a little kid they're like

837
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,440
oh you know my dad or my uncle or my

838
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,418
grandpa or whatever was into cars and so

839
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,880
I learned about the pain and I learned

840
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,679
about the transmission and I learned

841
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,320
about the engine and I know everything

842
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,360
about all these things and you know

843
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,759
probably at a car show there's probably

844
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,379
like maybe half of the people are like

845
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:36,658
that and this is just random I don't

846
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,278
know half ten percent ninety percent I

847
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,320
don't [ __ ] no there's a lot of people

848
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,359
who are there too who just heard that if

849
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,700
you have fast [ __ ] ball and cars

850
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:48,359
there's people will think you're [ __ ]

851
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,880
cool and you can just be you know into

852
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,139
that and it's all good and you know and

853
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,419
then there's even

854
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,159
you know I don't know I feel like that's

855
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:59,778
how it is with weed there's a lot of

856
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,778
people who are just into it

857
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:05,398
to try to [ __ ] milk it for for what

858
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:07,980
it is and wouldn't have really done any

859
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:11,519
of it when it was when nobody was

860
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,659
looking you know what I mean and

861
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,940
um

862
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,059
yeah I don't know man the whole the

863
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:21,000
whole scene is just it's a it's a Trippy

864
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:24,719
it's a Trippy thing to learn like to

865
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,719
to see how [ __ ] is and and uh

866
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,519
and all that and really kind of see it

867
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,918
and then go okay well there's probably a

868
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,739
lot of people who are smarter than me

869
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,679
who aren't as naive and gullible in

870
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,658
general who just look for a [ __ ]

871
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,579
second and go oh this is all douchebags

872
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,820
a lot of these people are just full of

873
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:46,739
[ __ ] and you know there's that's

874
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,359
probably scares off a lot of people so

875
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,819
they don't get to meet somebody like

876
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:53,219
Bodhi or you know there's probably

877
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,899
people who think body is just like the

878
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,959
rest of everybody if they don't know him

879
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:59,819
if you know Bodhi you're like no bodhi's

880
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,659
the cool dude he just happens to be in

881
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:06,000
the mix you know and then even like me

882
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:08,519
compared to Bodhi I'm probably [ __ ]

883
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,400
20 percent more douchebaggy than Bodie

884
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:13,259
is or you know like there's just like a

885
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,059
certain there's a certain thing that I

886
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,740
think is probably really off-putting to

887
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,019
a lot of people who are really into just

888
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:21,358
having the [ __ ] they like

889
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:24,239
to where you'll just never hear from

890
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,799
them because they're just [ __ ] cool

891
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,598
you know and they don't they're not

892
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,339
going to be they're not going to get the

893
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,039
interest in thinking like oh I want

894
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:33,599
somebody to grow my stuff because you

895
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:35,460
know like no nothing ever happens with

896
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,838
it and I put all this time into it and

897
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,659
that's like what happened to me I was

898
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,639
like just so [ __ ] excited that

899
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:44,759
there's people who are into [ __ ]

900
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,618
seats you know that I was just like whoa

901
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,020
this is crazy and then like all said and

902
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,358
done you're like okay cool I have a

903
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:54,920
better feeling for a better feel for how

904
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:58,139
things are there are people who are

905
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,599
really like into plants and they really

906
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:03,000
really like to do this and then there's

907
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,400
a lot of people who just want to say you

908
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,320
know they're the guy who found the rks

909
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,380
and sell a thousand packs for a [ __ ]

910
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,500
bunch of money before they [ __ ] you

911
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,820
know whatever just the not just to kind

912
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,460
of sum it up if there's a million

913
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,338
versions of that but it but it but it is

914
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,960
you know the guy who's sitting there who

915
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:23,699
really has some [ __ ] that really smells

916
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,159
like a dead skunk he's probably like

917
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,539
yeah but I already have it and what what

918
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,519
the [ __ ] do I want to give it to anybody

919
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,079
for and I don't need anybody to give me

920
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,780
a pat on the back for having the real

921
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,300
skunk you know like [ __ ] like I said

922
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,760
like me I I do a lot of things because I

923
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,060
want to like be able to hand something

924
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,640
to somebody and have that interaction of

925
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:47,519
like oh you know like cool we're we're

926
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,920
looking through stuff and I like that

927
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,619
you know but a lot of people they don't

928
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,260
have any there's no incentive there for

929
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:57,539
them because they're just chill and they

930
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,119
they are good on doing whatever they're

931
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:01,858
doing and they got it and that's great

932
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,838
me I'm like I want to make something

933
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:05,940
really good and then sit there with

934
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:07,980
somebody and go hey is it really good do

935
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,740
we are we having fun like is it a good

936
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,420
time to you know but that that's not how

937
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:14,939
everybody is so

938
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,838
I think I think there's probably a ton

939
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,639
of stuff

940
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,039
and then those people just are never

941
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,259
going to come out of the woodwork and in

942
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:26,460
a in a sense it's it's unfortunate for

943
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,460
the plants themselves because

944
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,200
there's no way to really that's not

945
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:34,259
really sustainable as far as genetics

946
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,000
like how are how are those plants going

947
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,920
to survive past the person who gots

948
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,960
their hand on it

949
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,519
um

950
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,320
but you know like that's their

951
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,659
prerogative they have those plants they

952
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,140
don't need to give them to anybody for

953
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:51,598
preservation or whatever it is and um

954
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:52,980
you know but I I am of the belief that

955
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,119
there's people who have crazy crazy

956
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,519
stuff

957
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,220
and they're holding that original clone

958
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:02,099
you want they have the crazy seeds that

959
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:04,259
everybody wants and they're just like

960
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:05,880
yeah what you know because I know a lot

961
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,859
of people I have a lot of friends who

962
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,820
are who are

963
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:13,799
really weeded out and who you know you

964
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,720
talk to them about something they don't

965
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,300
they don't they have no idea of this

966
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:21,319
whole scene I didn't know you know like

967
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:25,920
I at one point I thought there was like

968
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:29,640
maybe like bog and sub cool and

969
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,740
Greenhouse and Neville like I think

970
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:33,659
that's probably at one point that was

971
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:35,578
you know I thought that was that's the

972
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:37,799
whole thing you know I didn't know there

973
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,599
was all these people who were on the

974
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,339
forums and I didn't know there was any

975
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,838
such thing as a forum and like the

976
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:45,480
forums were gone by the time I even

977
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:46,500
heard of them pretty much

978
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,039
um

979
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:52,920
you know and I you know I I think we I

980
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:57,358
think we get to see a little slice like

981
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,119
the people who want to come out and have

982
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,679
the interaction for whatever reason and

983
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,720
some of them like I said some people are

984
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,179
like Bodhi they want everybody to have

985
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,399
cool staff they get a kick out of it

986
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:11,039
they spend a lot of time doing stuff so

987
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,320
they want to make something of it

988
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:16,079
um you know and then there's people who

989
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,240
will just straight up [ __ ] you know

990
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,060
say they

991
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,699
made OG when they didn't and made

992
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:25,679
[ __ ] whatever when they didn't and

993
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:27,960
they're only there to to do something

994
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,819
and you know I don't even think there's

995
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,420
anything wrong with any of it like it's

996
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:36,059
not on a scale of of of like I was

997
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,760
saying earlier who are you hurting

998
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:42,358
the very worst of the weed guys you know

999
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,079
maybe they're kind of charlatans but I

1000
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:45,838
mean

1001
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,300
you know [ __ ] they're not matching up

1002
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,980
meth and probably half of those

1003
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,480
charlatans probably were a little while

1004
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:57,059
ago to be honest so

1005
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:59,820
oh God did a real wisdom right there I

1006
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:03,179
love that I noticed in your answer that

1007
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,820
you uh mentioned bogg who sadly passed

1008
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:08,399
away recently and he's a guy who was

1009
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,500
really influential both in you know

1010
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,059
sharing knowledge but also his work you

1011
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,699
know it shows up in a lot of various

1012
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:16,259
breeders work I don't know if any of

1013
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:18,118
your current lines you have for sale

1014
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,619
have his genetics in them but I do know

1015
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,079
that you've grown out a bunch of his

1016
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,760
work and have posted about it before was

1017
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,619
there any of his strains that

1018
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,740
particularly stood out to you as like

1019
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:30,780
some of the more favorites from him so I

1020
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:33,479
haven't actually grown out

1021
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,260
um a lot of his stuff

1022
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,320
um

1023
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:41,280
I had a clone

1024
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,960
which came to me as Bubba d

1025
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,940
and

1026
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,159
um

1027
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,980
I realized after a long time after

1028
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,379
knowing his his sour bubble from him

1029
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,780
given me the the flower when I met him

1030
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,099
because he sometimes he'll just if you

1031
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,859
see him at a cut he'll just like give

1032
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,338
you a gram of flour or or like a you

1033
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:04,139
know a piece of bubble hash or something

1034
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:05,759
and one time when I was there he gave me

1035
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:09,358
a bag of flour

1036
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,099
and you know it was like a gram or two

1037
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,319
and I pulled it out and I was like this

1038
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:15,300
is so familiar and I got it home and I

1039
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,880
realized

1040
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,300
this is the same as Bubba d

1041
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:26,460
and so what I realized when I thought

1042
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:30,240
about it I went sour bubble Bubba D sour

1043
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:34,079
d Bubba bubble it's pretty likely that

1044
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:36,919
this was a sour bubble and somebody

1045
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,960
called It Bubba D you know just because

1046
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,720
of the two the two words you know it's

1047
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,460
like they go together and the weed was

1048
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,199
so similar and I never knew what it was

1049
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,000
and I was always like I don't know how

1050
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,980
this could be a sour diesel cross

1051
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,659
especially because I I bred it a little

1052
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,719
bit too

1053
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:58,159
um and there was no you know sour pops

1054
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:00,959
out some trippy weird uh kind of larfy

1055
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,358
foxtaily stuff when you breed with sour

1056
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,880
uh initially

1057
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:09,539
and so

1058
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,480
I think that what I had is Bubba d

1059
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:14,759
was really a sour bubble Club

1060
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,980
and so you know that was one that was

1061
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,420
around here for a while and people you

1062
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,599
know some people around here are kind of

1063
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:25,619
recognized oh yeah I remember that

1064
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:29,400
um and then I got sour strawberry from

1065
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:32,000
them and I think I got uh

1066
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,460
maybe Boggle gum

1067
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,219
and or one of those ones like that

1068
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,699
uh one of the bubble gum ones and then I

1069
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:44,219
got the sour bubble so I grew the sour

1070
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:45,960
strawberry and I told the story on a

1071
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:47,578
thing a little while ago I grew the sour

1072
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,320
strawberry and I didn't really mean to

1073
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,880
do anything with it I just wanted to see

1074
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,800
what a half pack looked like because I

1075
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,160
was gonna if I liked it a lot I was

1076
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,480
gonna get a couple packs to look through

1077
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,639
um

1078
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,980
which I didn't you know I should have

1079
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,440
but I I didn't and uh that's a good

1080
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,300
lesson for people that if you want some

1081
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,818
seeds get the damn seeds and put them in

1082
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,300
the fridge because whether you're an

1083
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:15,838
older guy like like bog or your younger

1084
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,640
guy like uh you know it doesn't don't

1085
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,440
just think that these people who make

1086
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:21,598
these seeds will always have the same

1087
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,159
stock or they'll continue making seeds

1088
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,318
or they'll always be around for you to

1089
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:27,239
get seeds from if you want something you

1090
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:28,500
should get it you know

1091
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:30,959
um because this has happened you know

1092
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,179
this is something that happens a lot and

1093
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,179
people go ah [ __ ] I should have got them

1094
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,279
all I could get them and uh you know the

1095
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:40,559
seeds honestly the thing with Bob was

1096
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,380
not being able to get his seeds is the

1097
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:47,219
very least of the loss that you know

1098
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,460
everybody has to take with with uh him

1099
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:53,219
leaving because he's uh

1100
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,139
he's just a really cool guy I mean I you

1101
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:57,480
know I didn't really know him and I I

1102
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,519
sat with him and he told me about how he

1103
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,679
uh he was riding in this car I think

1104
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,199
with with Shanti Baba it was somebody

1105
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,539
like legendary like that and we're

1106
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:10,019
riding on the Autobahn in this car with

1107
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:13,980
a [ __ ] 700 horsepower some [ __ ]

1108
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:15,239
Jag [ __ ] V12 or some [ __ ] and you

1109
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,000
know we're [ __ ] we're going for

1110
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,098
[ __ ] 100 miles 120 miles an hour or

1111
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,659
blah blah blah you know telling these

1112
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,920
stories and I'm like wow this guy's a

1113
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,000
character you know and he was just cool

1114
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,659
because he was telling me these old

1115
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,179
stories of being in Europe and

1116
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:32,039
different stuff and you know I wish I I

1117
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,318
wish I could remember the stories more

1118
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:35,759
clearly but what he did leave me with

1119
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,079
the impression he left me with the

1120
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,780
impression that

1121
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,200
he was just a really uh

1122
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:47,339
um just a nice guy really really a real

1123
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:51,419
guy and had done real stuff and uh

1124
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:53,460
and you know was was uh he was a

1125
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,318
one-of-a-kind guy you wouldn't you know

1126
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,000
and and everybody I've talked to was

1127
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,440
like oh he you know he was the coolest

1128
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,480
guy you could talk to with the shows and

1129
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,119
stuff and he would go to the smallest

1130
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,280
shows and the biggest shows and he was

1131
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,380
you know the most approachable guy he

1132
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,019
was a really good um he was a really

1133
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,000
good role model I feel like for for

1134
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:14,460
people in general and especially for

1135
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,420
people like on the weed scene he was not

1136
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,519
uh

1137
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,338
he was not a

1138
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,500
um pain in the ass he wasn't a douchey

1139
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:25,259
dude he was just like uh

1140
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,000
did what he liked to do and came to do

1141
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,720
his thing and

1142
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,818
um

1143
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:32,219
you know I thought he was really uh

1144
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:33,539
really kind of a remarkable guy in that

1145
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:37,318
sense

1146
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:40,679
um but anyway I I got the uh I got the

1147
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,300
sour strawberry and I I grew my half

1148
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:44,578
pack I still have a half pack of them

1149
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,079
and I still have the other pack that I

1150
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,339
can't put a finger on exactly what it is

1151
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,660
but I think it's Boggle down because I

1152
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:50,880
was interested in that because he's like

1153
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:52,679
this is straight the straight bubble gum

1154
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,180
in the bubble gum sense as opposed to

1155
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:57,118
the sour bubble which you bread to be

1156
00:45:54,179 --> 00:46:00,118
more cushy and um

1157
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,119
so

1158
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,880
um

1159
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:07,559
I grew those sour strawberries out and I

1160
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,480
what happened was I missed a male in a

1161
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,179
five and a half inch pot

1162
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,199
in a flat of plants and I just looked I

1163
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:14,519
had looked through them looked through

1164
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,379
and looked through them and it was

1165
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,599
probably like one where I was like ah

1166
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,640
it's unsexed but it looks like a girl or

1167
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,280
whatever you know classic story

1168
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,559
and you know by the time I saw it was a

1169
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,940
male it had a couple balls that had

1170
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,039
popped so I wanted to put these few

1171
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,740
stray seeds and one of the thing that

1172
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:35,940
was in the flat with that

1173
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:39,598
um there was a plant or two

1174
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:42,619
um of this uh animal cookies cross

1175
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:46,800
animal cookies cross Cherry West

1176
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:48,420
and uh that cherry West was like one of

1177
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,800
the ones that I was talking about where

1178
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,619
they're not

1179
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,400
um not crazy and exotic no tear penalty

1180
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:59,039
no no fruit punch no watermelon no

1181
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,380
floral it was just like uh one of the

1182
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,119
more normal of the Cherry West like what

1183
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,920
they usually are which is more like what

1184
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,900
I call black cherry which was just this

1185
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:12,079
deep Cherry kind of

1186
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:13,980
um Berry flavored thing and uh

1187
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,140
so

1188
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,858
it was basically like animal cookies

1189
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:22,259
Mutt and Seed you know and um super

1190
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,838
Frosty really really nice

1191
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,880
and my buddies in the bay called it the

1192
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,858
knowledge and I have a picture like way

1193
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,140
back on my feet somewhere of theirs from

1194
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:34,318
indoor that's real pretty and

1195
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:35,219
so I found these couple seeds

1196
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,159
um

1197
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:40,078
and you know I might still have a couple

1198
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,239
of the original seeds I'm not sure I

1199
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,599
really should you know hunt through to

1200
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,879
see but anyway I took those and I bred

1201
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,980
them and uh

1202
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,380
and I have to them

1203
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,858
and

1204
00:47:52,380 --> 00:48:00,059
I happen to find just a gorgeous male in

1205
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:03,059
the F1 and put that on

1206
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:05,099
two females that were my favorites and

1207
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:06,838
one of them was more green and kind of

1208
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,880
garlicky and one of them was more purple

1209
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:13,199
and more kind of cookie gene pool type

1210
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:16,640
stuff and so uh those ones I've uh I've

1211
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:19,618
gone through them and

1212
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,818
uh so you know kind of turn that into a

1213
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:24,180
thing and those are really nice they're

1214
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:26,639
like the sour bubble

1215
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:30,118
um didn't the sour bubble added that

1216
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,779
that broadleaf gnarly little squat thing

1217
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,519
um

1218
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,960
that they already had but it kind of

1219
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:37,199
accentuated it

1220
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,780
and it didn't take away from the resin

1221
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:43,139
because it was really resinous too

1222
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:45,720
and it added kind of like a jelly thing

1223
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:47,279
that made it so that overall they kind

1224
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,519
of have this like peanut butter and

1225
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,940
jelly cookies thing

1226
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:57,119
um but in a good way

1227
00:48:52,940 --> 00:49:01,559
and uh they're just gorgeous and it made

1228
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:05,640
them have that more like classic uh

1229
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:07,619
gnarly broadleaf chunk bud

1230
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:11,039
um kind of like

1231
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:13,380
kind of like hinduy look but

1232
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,179
um just really really nice and and a lot

1233
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,780
of them get really dark

1234
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:20,818
and uh and I I was stoked because I have

1235
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,260
the I have other lines that are the same

1236
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:24,900
kind of cookie stuff

1237
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,660
but the sour strawberry gave it this

1238
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,280
other thing that is um I don't know

1239
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:31,139
they're just really nice I like them a

1240
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,680
lot and I did a lot of those

1241
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:36,659
and I'm trying to you know I have f3s of

1242
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:39,259
them now and hopefully they're good and

1243
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:41,879
I'll probably make them into

1244
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:45,180
f4s I'll probably clone some of the best

1245
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,818
of the f3s and then uh you know try to

1246
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,980
keep around to F maybe a pair of f3s to

1247
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,639
make f4s

1248
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,280
um

1249
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,858
for a long time you know to just have

1250
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,500
that be a thing and then I have you know

1251
00:49:55,858 --> 00:50:00,838
like I said I still have that uh half a

1252
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,699
pack of those sour strawberries left so

1253
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,159
if I can get those to crack I'll

1254
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,899
probably breed that with the sour

1255
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:09,299
strawberry again and try to make more

1256
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,700
sour strawberries pure to have to to dig

1257
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,579
into deeper knowing now that I like what

1258
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:17,219
came out of it and then uh

1259
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:19,220
I had to pack a sour bubble

1260
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:23,338
and I had it for years

1261
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:23,338
and then 2019

1262
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:30,420
I grew them

1263
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,559
and I was I kept the mail for a long

1264
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,440
time

1265
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,539
and I was gonna see them and I just kind

1266
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,460
of didn't do it and then they really

1267
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:40,199
started budding and I think I had only

1268
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,559
got

1269
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:45,539
like four plants out of my pack because

1270
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,099
I had kept them for a while and I hadn't

1271
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:48,659
had them stored well for a while because

1272
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,338
I had left them out because I planned to

1273
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:51,838
pop them for a whole year and then I

1274
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,880
never got around to them and then

1275
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,818
finally I put them away so I screwed

1276
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,039
them up a little bit and uh

1277
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:00,119
you know I always saw bog at the

1278
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,920
different like he would come to the

1279
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,380
farmer's market here

1280
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,599
um and so like I was used to you know

1281
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,880
seeing always his booth and I'll just

1282
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,160
grab more you know

1283
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,318
um so I didn't grab any of them and I

1284
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:15,598
had that one pack I only got so many I

1285
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,838
think I got a I think I got a boy that I

1286
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:23,039
really liked and I should have kept

1287
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:26,460
and uh I got a few girls and the girls

1288
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:28,259
were just not quite what I wanted

1289
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,960
um as far as the smells that they had

1290
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,400
they were a little too plain but I

1291
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,460
should have [ __ ] seeded them all

1292
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,139
because the reality is that strain is

1293
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,940
plain anyway

1294
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:41,338
and there's some good ones that pop out

1295
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:43,500
that have like a special liminess to it

1296
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:45,960
and that contributed to like the sour

1297
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,579
dub but

1298
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,500
um

1299
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:51,000
it's just not getting what you want out

1300
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,338
of the few plants it doesn't really

1301
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,019
matter you should just seed them and

1302
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:56,578
then you'll have so many that you can

1303
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:58,159
find what you want because all of a

1304
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,900
sudden you'll have you know whatever

1305
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,338
[ __ ] hundreds of thousands of f2s you

1306
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,318
can look through and get exactly what

1307
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:06,838
you want but I just kind of I kind of

1308
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,880
[ __ ] them off and uh now you know I

1309
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:10,980
kick myself because I'm like man I would

1310
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,660
have had a bunch of those and if I had

1311
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,858
had them in bulk right now I could

1312
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:16,440
probably

1313
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:19,199
um I could probably you know auction

1314
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,480
them off and and shoot the shoot the

1315
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,759
proceeds over to miss bog and [ __ ] and I

1316
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,960
you know I don't really have anything to

1317
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,960
do that but I do have the sour

1318
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,119
strawberry cross and uh you know I could

1319
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,920
do something with those and I'm waiting

1320
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,920
to see how everything pans out right now

1321
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,680
with their GoFundMe and if it doesn't if

1322
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:41,039
it's if it goes slower than it should

1323
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:44,279
you know we can maybe maybe go on go on

1324
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:49,199
and do something online and then uh

1325
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,480
and then uh their niece hit me up and

1326
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,159
she she was kind of just filling me in

1327
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,139
on where everything stands because I

1328
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:57,899
guess she had seen my post

1329
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:00,000
and um I told her you know I go hey if

1330
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,940
there's anything you guys need up there

1331
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,318
don't go without it because everybody

1332
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,880
everybody loves them and they're you

1333
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,219
know we'll get it we'll get it together

1334
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,200
so hopefully they're

1335
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:12,539
um you know hopefully everything works

1336
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,618
out smoothly and you know if it if

1337
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:15,779
there's any

1338
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:17,519
real issues we you know everybody will

1339
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,800
figure it out that's one cool thing

1340
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,000
about a bunch of weed heads is they kind

1341
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,300
of all

1342
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,880
they kind of all have a good idea that

1343
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,700
everything can go wrong when you're not

1344
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,160
a square and you don't have a pension

1345
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:34,858
and you don't have you know the things

1346
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,719
that come with being a square so I think

1347
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:39,779
there's a little more compassion in the

1348
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,659
um amongst a bunch of weed heads uh and

1349
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,359
Growers than there would be among people

1350
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:47,838
who who don't like understand that world

1351
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:47,838
you know

1352
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,059
yeah there's definitely some good

1353
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,940
camaraderie within the community when

1354
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,440
people fall on hard times and so yeah

1355
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,818
everyone check out the GoFundMe if

1356
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,519
you're listening to this shortly after

1357
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:04,858
the release and by all means if there's

1358
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:06,900
any bug genetics you can scoop up now

1359
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:08,759
would be a great time to add some good

1360
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,680
ones to the library and funnily enough

1361
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,420
I've actually grown out and worked with

1362
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,399
some Sour strawberry hybrids a friend

1363
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,900
did and they were all fire too so I'm

1364
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,880
totally backing you on this sour

1365
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,079
strawberry cross sounding like a a real

1366
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,380
winner

1367
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:24,900
I wanted to ask you we've spoken about a

1368
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,720
plethora of different mythical and

1369
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,579
Awesome Genetics

1370
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,858
what seeds do you have in your Vault

1371
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:33,599
that are some of the most special to you

1372
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:35,279
you've probably got more than just one

1373
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,079
but like some of the ones that come to

1374
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,359
mind when you think of like the really

1375
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,240
special ones to you and do you plan to

1376
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,578
crack any of them anytime soon

1377
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:47,039
my craziest stuff is the stuff I was

1378
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:49,200
talking about that I can't get to Pop

1379
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,759
um I'm really glad I got them in the

1380
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,500
fridge when I did because I know they're

1381
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,720
alive

1382
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:57,059
um I know they're not rancid and they're

1383
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,799
not overheated and dehydrated like

1384
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:00,059
there's live cells they just don't have

1385
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,500
enough to go

1386
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:03,839
but

1387
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,760
you know the old I have like Big Blue

1388
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,039
Cross Big Red

1389
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,780
those are old two afghanis that I mixed

1390
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:12,358
together because I could never get a get

1391
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,519
a good big blue male

1392
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:16,739
and I wasn't I didn't know enough at the

1393
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,960
time to realize that it's it's pretty

1394
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,598
likely that the big blue male that

1395
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,619
there's a sex-linked trait with the boys

1396
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:28,500
that the boys never grow very fast

1397
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:30,119
um and that's just how they are and I

1398
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,159
just thought I had the terrible luck of

1399
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:35,160
always having small boys

1400
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:38,460
and now I'm like no dude those were all

1401
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:40,799
fine males you just didn't know that

1402
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,619
the males of big blue are small plants

1403
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,740
you know so

1404
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:49,619
um that's my theory anyway and I I think

1405
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:52,919
it's probably accurate

1406
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:55,380
um so I crossed it with big red uh

1407
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,358
the black Affy

1408
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,740
um I had a real special plan of the big

1409
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,598
red that was different than the rest

1410
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:02,338
that I crossed with the black coffee and

1411
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:05,220
those got grown out and were incredible

1412
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:06,900
but I didn't ever by the time I tried to

1413
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:08,879
plant them they just wouldn't quite grow

1414
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,460
it was like they would you put them in

1415
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,079
water and after 24 hours Boom the tail

1416
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,800
would be popping out and then it just

1417
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:18,900
doesn't grow you know so those those

1418
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,000
went in the fridge they've been there I

1419
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,220
know they're good

1420
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,139
um they just need tissue culture you

1421
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:26,818
know they need more than I can do for

1422
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:28,799
them

1423
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:30,719
um those are special I still have the

1424
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,440
original uh

1425
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,179
uh p-o-g NL oil can

1426
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,300
seeds

1427
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:42,598
um that were the father side of the

1428
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:45,920
uh black lime that were made with the

1429
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,920
same with uh with the female

1430
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,838
um that was the sister of the father of

1431
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:56,280
black lime I still have the original

1432
00:56:51,838 --> 00:57:00,539
black lime F1 seeds I still have

1433
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:03,900
a couple of the sisters of black lime

1434
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:04,980
the original plant that I crossed with

1435
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,139
the

1436
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,800
with the POG

1437
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:10,199
um

1438
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,599
so I have those so they're basically the

1439
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:15,118
same thing as black lime except instead

1440
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,180
of the the black lime mother it's like a

1441
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:21,660
what I called like black cranberry and

1442
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:25,318
then one that looked like an NL

1443
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:28,500
um I have those seeds

1444
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:30,480
um I have uh

1445
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:33,059
you know those things those older things

1446
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,260
that the the the the black Affy cross

1447
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:36,480
Hindu

1448
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,460
the Hindu cross black Affy I mean and

1449
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,619
the Hindu cross Hindu cross black Affy

1450
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:44,039
those are right there in the top of what

1451
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:46,440
I would get going if I knew I had a

1452
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:48,659
reliable person to do tissue culture to

1453
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:52,139
pull out cells and turn them into callus

1454
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:53,699
and turn them into roots and shoots

1455
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:58,440
um

1456
00:57:53,699 --> 00:58:00,719
and then you know there's a

1457
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,659
there's the stuff that's newer that saw

1458
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,759
that's also really special I mean as as

1459
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:08,519
neat as those old things are and as much

1460
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,859
potential there is and all that the

1461
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:14,579
reason why I have what I have now is

1462
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:15,779
because I made improvements on those

1463
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:19,200
things

1464
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:21,660
overall as far as like jarrow is like

1465
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:24,598
you can still get kind of the Hindu AFI

1466
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:26,879
type but they're way you know the plants

1467
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:29,760
are five times bigger

1468
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,039
um they're way more mold resistant and

1469
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,839
you can still get the same kind of weed

1470
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,480
out of those seeds

1471
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,578
so that's the reason why some of these

1472
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,260
things didn't get planted originally was

1473
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,640
because they weren't practical and I had

1474
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,440
made hybrids with them that were

1475
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:44,519
practical and still had all the same

1476
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,019
good things

1477
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:48,539
it's like I was saying earlier though

1478
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:50,880
you get attached to the idea of The

1479
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:52,980
Originals and the provenance and the

1480
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,960
Purity and

1481
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,420
um all that and so that's why those

1482
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,099
things are real special and then I have

1483
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,059
like some seeds

1484
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:03,720
um

1485
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:06,960
I have some seeds uh my good good friend

1486
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:13,858
Maurice passed away in

1487
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:16,260
um 2008. and his dad was like a kind of

1488
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:17,880
a legendary guy a really really good

1489
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:21,859
artist

1490
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,760
um a Frenchman and uh

1491
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,659
he

1492
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,339
um

1493
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:31,078
had got some seeds from me around maybe

1494
00:59:28,338 --> 00:59:34,019
2006 and he had his own seeds that he

1495
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,680
had kept for years and

1496
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:37,440
um

1497
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:40,199
he you know he's passed as well past

1498
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,260
like the following year uh

1499
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:46,379
after my buddy and he was my buddy too

1500
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:50,460
you know and he

1501
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:51,720
had a big seed collection and

1502
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,920
um

1503
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:58,439
his uh his his wife found it a few years

1504
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,119
later in a fridge and she said hey I

1505
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,980
don't know who else would really want

1506
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:04,380
this and there might even be some of

1507
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,818
your seeds in there and do you want them

1508
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:08,099
and I was like yeah

1509
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:09,779
so she gave me that collection and some

1510
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:11,579
of those are still viable but at the

1511
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,559
same time I'm afraid to plant them a

1512
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:15,119
little bit I took them out and repacked

1513
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,160
them and made sure they were real dry

1514
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,720
they actually had some moisture in them

1515
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,058
and I thought that it would have ruined

1516
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,039
all of them because when I opened up the

1517
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:25,079
bags there was like literally like water

1518
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,119
in some of the bags that had probably

1519
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:32,099
been there for two or three years at the

1520
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:33,780
least and uh I repacked them and I tried

1521
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:37,019
some of them and I got a couple of them

1522
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:40,200
to get a couple of uh uh plants that

1523
01:00:37,019 --> 01:00:42,179
actually grew and then they wound up

1524
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:44,399
getting messed up and I didn't get to

1525
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,618
get them to go all the way but they they

1526
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,298
would have it was my fault but I had

1527
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:50,760
only tried a couple of ones and there

1528
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:53,039
was a lot of them in there so it made me

1529
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,079
know they were viable and those are

1530
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:55,920
really special

1531
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:58,559
um

1532
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,559
there's one in there called I forgot

1533
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:04,319
there's one in there called BMW Bob

1534
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,359
Marley and the Whalers

1535
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,279
um there's one

1536
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:10,259
there's a couple in there that have like

1537
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,900
just a symbol and I don't know what it

1538
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,520
means there's a couple with initials and

1539
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,579
I don't know what they mean there's one

1540
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:19,500
in there that have seeds that are huge

1541
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:21,480
like they're almost as big as peas

1542
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:24,358
really you know they're like very big

1543
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,400
big big seeds from some kind of an old

1544
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:28,318
Afghani I assume he always had really

1545
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,358
tasty weed like when he would be rolling

1546
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:31,079
up weed we'd always want to check it out

1547
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:33,239
um

1548
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:38,160
so old school dudes spent a lot of time

1549
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:39,058
in uh in Goa in India and uh is just

1550
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,858
like

1551
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:46,019
really really

1552
01:01:40,858 --> 01:01:48,900
um cool dude and kind of you know uh

1553
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:51,659
you know old school dude

1554
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,420
um grew we'd totally secretly

1555
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:56,338
and was just an artist and you know had

1556
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,139
his little had a couple plants and stuff

1557
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:00,420
and you know always had good smoke and

1558
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:03,659
stuff and uh

1559
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:06,000
but um those are really special just

1560
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:07,858
because of the of the story and and who

1561
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,039
they're from and and

1562
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:13,199
um all that and then

1563
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,818
thinking of what else I'm trying to

1564
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,679
think of if there's anything else that's

1565
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:19,259
really really crazy I mean you know

1566
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:20,098
there's stuff that I have of course

1567
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:24,000
um

1568
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:26,519
you know Cherry limes limes root beers

1569
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,619
those are all cool but those older ones

1570
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:30,559
that I can't get to pop are actually the

1571
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:33,720
ones that are the most special

1572
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:37,200
and you know I've looked into a couple

1573
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:39,358
Labs I've talked to a couple people

1574
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,558
um and I'm just trying to find somebody

1575
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,739
who

1576
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:47,460
won't kill him won't

1577
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:49,318
rip me off and you know and has the

1578
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,798
right knowledge to do that kind of stuff

1579
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:55,500
and it's a pretty standard technique but

1580
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,539
there's a divide between people who do

1581
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,119
standard tissue culture for things like

1582
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:02,759
orchids and who really have the right

1583
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:03,780
Tech and for people who do

1584
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,740
um

1585
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:09,420
who do stuff with weed tissue culture

1586
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:13,259
because weed tissue culture tends to be

1587
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:16,318
like meristem and maybe putting seeds

1588
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:19,440
into a meaty into a into a media and

1589
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:21,599
getting them to sprout helping them

1590
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,579
along but I'd really like to find

1591
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,500
somebody who can just slice that seed

1592
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:27,420
down the middle like a mushroom pull out

1593
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,338
a little chunk grow that callus and turn

1594
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,380
that into plants and it's not that

1595
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:33,239
people don't do it but like I said

1596
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,220
there's a little divide and I you know

1597
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:38,098
apologies to anybody if I talked about

1598
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:39,419
the [ __ ] on the last one because uh I'm

1599
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:42,119
always talking about this [ __ ] because

1600
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,980
it's like the the holy grail for

1601
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:45,298
everybody because people have there's a

1602
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,159
lot of seeds

1603
01:03:45,298 --> 01:03:49,380
that won't come up

1604
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:51,719
that still have the genetics inside of

1605
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,579
them so it's like a really important

1606
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:55,139
thing I'm always hoping there's somebody

1607
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:59,099
who is

1608
01:03:55,139 --> 01:04:01,199
uh legit who you know winds up getting

1609
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:04,019
into this ship because it's pretty

1610
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,838
important for sure if anyone has that

1611
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:09,059
knowledge or ability you know the man to

1612
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:11,639
hit up let's make it happen

1613
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:13,920
I have to admit I was kind of trying to

1614
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:16,199
uh bait you with that question to talk

1615
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,380
about the seeds I've seen on your

1616
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:21,358
Instagram page of the Big Sur it's an

1617
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:22,980
interesting one for me because I find it

1618
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,900
really hard to get like good information

1619
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,539
on Big Sur it's sort of like this

1620
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,639
mythical strain anyway what's your

1621
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:31,259
experience and um if you had to guess

1622
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,699
the genetics behind it what do you

1623
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:35,640
think's in it

1624
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:38,578
so interestingly enough

1625
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:42,900
I haven't actually grown Big Sur holy

1626
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:45,380
weed I have a thing from Big Sur

1627
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:48,660
called Dolores

1628
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:50,700
and I got it from some friends of mine

1629
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:54,779
up here

1630
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:57,298
who I trade seeds with and they

1631
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,859
um are just old school people who like

1632
01:04:57,298 --> 01:05:00,659
they grow something and they're like oh

1633
01:04:58,858 --> 01:05:02,818
this is good you know and they keep it

1634
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:05,639
and maybe they make some more

1635
01:05:02,818 --> 01:05:07,798
move on to something else and have had

1636
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:09,058
stuff from you know from way back in the

1637
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:11,219
day they're they're old school they're

1638
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:14,220
in their 60s you know and uh

1639
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:15,539
really nice people and you know they

1640
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:17,338
told me hey we have this really cool

1641
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:19,440
Mexican do you want to grow some Mexican

1642
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:20,818
and I was like well does it finish here

1643
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,740
and they were like yeah yeah no it's

1644
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:24,298
it's really nice

1645
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:25,919
and I was like oh that's interesting I'm

1646
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:29,219
always interested in Mexican stuff

1647
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,380
that's more fast and and can be grown

1648
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:33,598
here because there's a lot of different

1649
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:35,940
climates in Mexico some of us some of

1650
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:39,000
Mexico is really mountainous and you

1651
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,380
can't grow like crazy sativas you know

1652
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,480
so

1653
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:45,599
the oaxacan's always been really popular

1654
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,519
here from the 70s and

1655
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,380
um it was kind of the best thing as far

1656
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,980
as I can tell before The Afghani and

1657
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:54,780
Pakistani came in for this climate and

1658
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,760
um

1659
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:59,099
so

1660
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,760
they gave me these ones and I grew them

1661
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:05,818
and what was really interesting to me

1662
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:09,839
and my mom said the same thing they're

1663
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:12,599
kind of the closest thing to the type of

1664
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:14,039
Northern Lights that we had which I

1665
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:17,220
believe was

1666
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:19,079
not the one or the two I think it was

1667
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:20,459
you know like the two crossed the five

1668
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:22,079
or something

1669
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,298
or whatever

1670
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,818
um I I just think that the Northern

1671
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:28,739
Lights we had had something else in it

1672
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:31,980
besides straight Afghani

1673
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:34,558
and growing these

1674
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:36,960
the way they look when you grow a lot of

1675
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:40,039
them it almost makes me wonder like is

1676
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,960
this like a relative of the type of

1677
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:44,760
Mexican that might have been in one of

1678
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,400
the kinds of Northern Lights that was

1679
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,720
used by the seed bank because you know

1680
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,579
the Northern Lights was like there was

1681
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,019
there was straight Afghani and then

1682
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:54,539
there was Afghani across a different

1683
01:06:52,019 --> 01:06:56,219
Afghani and there was Afghani across

1684
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:59,400
Hawaiian and there was Afghani cross

1685
01:06:56,219 --> 01:07:01,858
Mexican and I'm like well

1686
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,298
they're really really like really

1687
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:05,338
familiar

1688
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:07,920
um the way they look the way the plant

1689
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:10,619
looks the way it grows the color of the

1690
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,420
weed the color of the resin the type of

1691
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:15,140
resin

1692
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,420
the fact that they're not particularly

1693
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:20,759
smelly in any real outstanding way they

1694
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:23,700
kind of have like yeah they're a little

1695
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,980
sweet they have something to them not

1696
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:29,159
sweet enough to call Fruity

1697
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:30,559
sweet Kefi Hashi you know

1698
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:34,639
um

1699
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:39,539
but I was told

1700
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:40,879
that the Mexican used in the Big Sur

1701
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:44,220
Hollywood

1702
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,960
is Dolores

1703
01:07:44,219 --> 01:07:47,639
um and mine came from Big Sur from

1704
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,400
people who have had it I guess since

1705
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:52,500
like the 70s

1706
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,480
um I mean that's this that's the story

1707
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:59,579
and this isn't from people this is from

1708
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:03,298
people who are not in the whole scene of

1709
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:06,359
um trying to show off any provenance or

1710
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:10,739
anything like that so you know their

1711
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:12,298
story with me uh holds water because I'm

1712
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:14,219
like hey what are they they're like oh

1713
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:16,619
this guy he's our friend you know he's

1714
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:18,599
had this Mexican since the 70s he really

1715
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:20,338
likes it

1716
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,960
um I'm like well do you know where it's

1717
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:25,500
from and they're like yeah it's it's

1718
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,239
from Dolores and I'm like oh okay

1719
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,939
so

1720
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:33,238
you know Dolores Hidalgo is this place

1721
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:34,858
that's in the mountains in Mexico

1722
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:36,419
um it makes sense that what came from

1723
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:37,859
there would have been something that

1724
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:39,838
probably would have finished a little

1725
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:42,660
bit quicker than other stuff after they

1726
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:43,979
had selected it for their climate

1727
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:46,439
um

1728
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:51,659
I don't know it's been big Surfer

1729
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:54,838
[ __ ] 45 years or whatever

1730
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:56,698
um and uh that's the closest to what I

1731
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:58,318
have so this this year I made a whole

1732
01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:00,238
bunch

1733
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,039
um there's two basic types there's one

1734
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,439
that's more

1735
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:06,179
of like

1736
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:08,338
you know what people would call an

1737
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:10,079
Indica where the buds are more easy to

1738
01:09:08,338 --> 01:09:12,000
trim and the plant is a little more

1739
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:15,778
squat in there the buds are a little

1740
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,399
more round and fat and uh and when I

1741
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:20,040
first grew some of them a couple years

1742
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,719
ago I went these seem like they're not

1743
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:24,778
the same type like maybe they're

1744
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:26,579
pollution from some other line

1745
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:28,080
and so this year I did a bunch of them

1746
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,880
and then

1747
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:31,679
I went ahead and got rid of the males

1748
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,779
that looked like that type

1749
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,060
but I kept the girls so that I could

1750
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:38,100
kind of get an idea of what they are and

1751
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:40,140
now at this point I don't think they're

1752
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:42,179
a different type

1753
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:44,520
I think they're just a little bit better

1754
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,619
of a of a bud shape and a little bit

1755
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,520
more squat of a plant but still the same

1756
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:49,920
thing

1757
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,839
so if I make them again from the

1758
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,359
original seeds I'll probably split them

1759
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:56,719
into two lines and do like open

1760
01:09:54,359 --> 01:10:00,179
pollination with the tall

1761
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:02,279
slightly more leafy ones and do an open

1762
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:03,600
pollination with the short more golf

1763
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:05,519
Bali ones

1764
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,820
and um

1765
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,440
this time what I did was I just did more

1766
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:13,439
of the taller ones because they were the

1767
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:16,139
ones that I related more to be in like

1768
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,519
the true what I expected from a from a

1769
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:22,020
Mexican type

1770
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:24,120
um and uh they

1771
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,739
think are probably the ones that are a

1772
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:29,819
little bit more

1773
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:31,319
um a little bit more what I want and a

1774
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:32,880
little more like what our Northern

1775
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:34,979
Lights was

1776
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,880
the other ones are a little bit

1777
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:37,979
um

1778
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,260
I don't know like uh

1779
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:43,379
like more of a squat little Christmas

1780
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,480
tree more

1781
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,400
you know they're definitely not like you

1782
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:49,979
can't say they're like an Afghani type

1783
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:51,839
Indica type thing broadleaf they're not

1784
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:54,539
really but they just have a little bit

1785
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,819
they're a little bit less

1786
01:10:54,539 --> 01:10:59,579
um they're a little bit less of a narrow

1787
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:01,679
leaf type and the the ones that are the

1788
01:10:59,579 --> 01:11:04,439
more narrow leaf type are still like

1789
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,960
more almost like kind of like a OG plant

1790
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:09,000
but the squat ones are more like a OG

1791
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,500
shaped bud you know

1792
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,539
so

1793
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,880
um they're really interesting and so you

1794
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:16,800
know I made a whole bunch of those and I

1795
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,480
asked if I could

1796
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,520
um if I could share them and they were

1797
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:22,738
like yeah we don't you know they thought

1798
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,020
I was crazy for even you know wondering

1799
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:26,879
if I they're like yeah like what do you

1800
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,580
mean I was like well can I like make

1801
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,960
stuff with them and and you know do do

1802
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:33,359
whatever with them and they're like yeah

1803
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,920
nobody cares it's like Okay cool so I

1804
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:36,658
think what I'm probably gonna do I was

1805
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,520
gonna give some of them to CSI so he

1806
01:11:36,658 --> 01:11:42,238
could look through them because he has a

1807
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,440
a really cool Big Sir holy weed cut

1808
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,658
um

1809
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,579
and then I'll probably just try to

1810
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:48,899
spread them around a little bit and then

1811
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:50,939
you know

1812
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:52,679
somebody will be able to kind of tell if

1813
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:56,579
there's any if there's any relation

1814
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:58,980
there and maybe they're not just because

1815
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:01,198
they're you know

1816
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:03,779
um from the same place doesn't mean that

1817
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:06,439
they have anything to do except it'd be

1818
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:09,960
kind of weird if there was

1819
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:12,839
Dolores in the

1820
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:16,140
Big Sir holy weed and there was Dolores

1821
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:18,539
in Big Sur since the 70s and they didn't

1822
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:19,199
have any relation

1823
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:21,300
um

1824
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:23,039
that would be really [ __ ] strange so

1825
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:25,920
I think there's a relation there but as

1826
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:28,260
far as Big Sir holy weed I don't

1827
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,420
I can't even remember seeing it I think

1828
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,980
I've seen some of it before I've

1829
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,779
definitely talked to people a lot about

1830
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:37,198
it because people said it was so good

1831
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:40,619
but um I have some

1832
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:43,439
from SoCal seeds

1833
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:45,000
and then I think I have some possibly

1834
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,059
from Coastal

1835
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,859
which are slightly different lines and

1836
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,500
then I think Bodhi has one a little

1837
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:53,939
different than what Coastal has but I I

1838
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,520
was interested in it but I've never

1839
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:59,819
actually done any of them so I can't say

1840
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:02,280
like Hands-On what they look like in any

1841
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:04,738
similarity or whatever but I will say

1842
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:06,420
the Dolores

1843
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:08,039
I

1844
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:11,460
smoke

1845
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:15,238
and it has a very interesting potency

1846
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:18,899
where it kind of makes things seem

1847
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:21,238
like lightly absurd like you kind of get

1848
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:23,219
a chuckle out of everything from it and

1849
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:24,419
when you like you can like stare at a

1850
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:28,800
wall

1851
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:31,319
and it's not like directly visuals but

1852
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,699
you really look and you're like am I is

1853
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:35,099
something happening

1854
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:37,139
is there like

1855
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:40,020
am I getting a visual and you're like

1856
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:41,579
look and you go no it's normal but you

1857
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,739
stare and you go I

1858
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:45,300
I feel like there's something I feel

1859
01:13:43,738 --> 01:13:47,459
like I'm almost getting like a visual

1860
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:50,039
here you know it's pretty neat it's a

1861
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:51,779
cool um it's a cool kind of high and I

1862
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,119
don't know

1863
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:56,399
if you're a super super heavy daily

1864
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:58,500
smoker like I used to always be I don't

1865
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:01,079
know that you would notice that Nuance

1866
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:04,260
of it but um it's definitely not just

1867
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:07,880
your normal high it's definitely

1868
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:10,380
um there's definitely some you know

1869
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,119
narrow Leaf stuff going on there it's

1870
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,199
not a it's not a dole high at all it

1871
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:15,539
makes you feel

1872
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:17,460
neat you know there's something to it so

1873
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:19,920
those are cool plants and they're really

1874
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,960
hearty they don't mold

1875
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,319
um they don't like to get PM unless you

1876
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,840
really kind of making them unhealthy

1877
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:31,380
uh they're not the sturdiest because

1878
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:33,539
they Bud pretty gnarly but like

1879
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:35,400
they're they're they're they're a really

1880
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:37,920
really good plant there's something that

1881
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:39,539
I'll definitely uh I'll definitely try

1882
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,300
to spread around and I don't know how

1883
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:44,219
many I have now but I think I have

1884
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,579
thousands of them I think I have maybe

1885
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:50,698
like 10 girls fully Seated on The Late

1886
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:53,100
side so they're not like corn on the cob

1887
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:54,899
but they're like all around the outside

1888
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,640
of the bud there's a bunch of mature

1889
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:59,819
seed you know so there's there should be

1890
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,199
enough to um that after you know a

1891
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:05,039
couple years there should be something

1892
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:07,979
that's kind of uh around you know

1893
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:10,800
what a great answer and um a really

1894
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:12,839
interesting High by the sounds of it you

1895
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,659
mentioned in there wanting to figure out

1896
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,179
you know if Dolores was the same or a

1897
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:19,920
part of the Big Sur at least and it made

1898
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:22,920
me think back to a comment you made

1899
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:25,679
earlier about phylos and like how they

1900
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:28,020
elude relationships between strains and

1901
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:31,380
stuff and I guess what I'm interested in

1902
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:34,260
kind of discussing is obviously people

1903
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:36,659
have pretty valid concerns for not

1904
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:39,780
trusting file us with genetic samples

1905
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:42,059
anymore but I do Wonder

1906
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:43,619
do we have any faith in the technology

1907
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,880
but you know if we kind of put aside

1908
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:46,819
personal feelings about the people

1909
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,980
running the company and their intentions

1910
01:15:46,819 --> 01:15:51,658
do you when something on filos shows

1911
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:55,019
something else as a relative for example

1912
01:15:51,658 --> 01:15:57,679
do you put any stock in that anymore

1913
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:02,640
you know I do

1914
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:06,560
there's levels to what they can do so

1915
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,560
if it says something is related

1916
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:15,199
it's very closely related

1917
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:15,199
if it says something is not related

1918
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:23,459
it might still be very closely related

1919
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:25,980
and if it says something is the same

1920
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:30,239
it might just be related

1921
01:16:25,979 --> 01:16:31,559
meaning if you give them s1s from a

1922
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:33,779
plant

1923
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,340
they'll think they're all the same plan

1924
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:37,920
but they're not

1925
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,920
if you give them something that's been

1926
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,020
bred apart for a few Generations

1927
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,880
they'll think it's not very closely

1928
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:47,000
related to anything even though it

1929
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,719
really is

1930
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,859
so

1931
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:55,460
for example I have cherry limeade F3 in

1932
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:55,460
there right

1933
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:00,300
um

1934
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:03,599
they can't show that it's related to OG

1935
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,940
or Urkel

1936
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,880
or

1937
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:10,379
you know black line Reserve which is in

1938
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,579
there

1939
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,039
um

1940
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:15,420
Northern Lights like I know what's in

1941
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:18,198
there right

1942
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:21,179
but in their

1943
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:23,099
analysis they're like oh yeah it's not

1944
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:25,619
related to anything closely I'm like

1945
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:29,100
well there's a lot of Urkel and a lot of

1946
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:30,059
OG in it I just know that you know

1947
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:33,420
um

1948
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:35,940
and it just doesn't show it so in that

1949
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:37,980
sense they can't quite do what they kind

1950
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:40,319
of say they can do

1951
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:43,500
but at the same time

1952
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:47,099
it makes me realize that if they tell

1953
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:50,460
you that it's related

1954
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:54,020
it's related you know what I mean and

1955
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:54,020
they've shown relations that

1956
01:17:54,119 --> 01:18:00,420
are easy to know through other avenues

1957
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,699
and then you look at their thing and you

1958
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:05,219
go yeah they know it

1959
01:18:02,698 --> 01:18:07,319
there it is you know

1960
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:08,460
so

1961
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:10,738
um

1962
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:14,039
you know I it's a weird thing because

1963
01:18:10,738 --> 01:18:15,959
it's like okay should you trust them and

1964
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:17,460
think that everything they say is true

1965
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:20,340
and no

1966
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:23,158
but at the same time I'm like I I don't

1967
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:25,500
really see what I lost by having my

1968
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:26,279
stuff in there

1969
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,679
um

1970
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:31,920
I didn't really gain much

1971
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:33,719
but with certain samples I think you

1972
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,119
could you know there is something to

1973
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:38,039
gain I think it might be worth putting

1974
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:40,920
in Big Sur holy weed and putting in

1975
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:43,079
Dolores but knowing what I know it's

1976
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:45,239
likely that because Big Sir holy weed

1977
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:47,100
has been bred several times and Dolores

1978
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:49,259
has been bred several times they

1979
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:51,060
probably won't show

1980
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,640
um any relation even if they were

1981
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:55,620
related because

1982
01:18:53,640 --> 01:19:00,420
what they're good at showing is when

1983
01:18:55,619 --> 01:19:03,420
things are sisters or parents

1984
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:04,440
or progeny

1985
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:06,420
um

1986
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:08,639
as soon as something's not a first

1987
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,800
cousin

1988
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:13,320
or a second cousin it seems like they

1989
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,340
kind of can't see it and as soon as

1990
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:18,299
something is a

1991
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,159
full

1992
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:22,980
um like as soon as something is an S1

1993
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:24,839
and there's no outside genetics then

1994
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:27,299
there's no outside genetics so it's

1995
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:30,179
obviously the same but that's not true

1996
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:34,079
you know so they'll tell you that ghost

1997
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:35,699
OG Skywalker and every other OG cutter

1998
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:39,119
all the same cut

1999
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:41,158
so when you grow them you'll think oh

2000
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,539
well there must have just been some kind

2001
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:46,139
of uh

2002
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:48,420
you know epigenetics or

2003
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,820
something happened where this got turned

2004
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:53,819
on and that got turned off and then you

2005
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:56,639
know it caused this uh outward

2006
01:19:53,819 --> 01:19:58,198
appearance of a mutation so that now it

2007
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,420
seems like this one's different than

2008
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:02,939
this one but look there's the genetic

2009
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:05,520
test they're both the same it's like nah

2010
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:07,859
they're they're not they're not the same

2011
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,860
because people have actually taken

2012
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:13,198
a couple s1s

2013
01:20:10,859 --> 01:20:14,819
that they know they started themselves

2014
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:16,738
from seed and sent them in and they're

2015
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:18,658
like Yep this is all all three of these

2016
01:20:16,738 --> 01:20:20,218
are one plant and they're like no I

2017
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:22,500
popped those and I know I didn't mix up

2018
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:25,920
the samples and they're like yeah sorry

2019
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:27,960
I guess you you you mixed it up like I

2020
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,399
asked them on there on one of their like

2021
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,020
on their Instagram one time I was like

2022
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:32,158
Hey like you know do you guys realize

2023
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,159
that you can't tell the difference

2024
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:37,379
between plants from seed that come from

2025
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:38,698
one parent with no outside influence and

2026
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,920
they were like no we can tell the

2027
01:20:38,698 --> 01:20:43,559
difference if we say it's the same it's

2028
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:46,199
the same and I was like you can't though

2029
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:49,800
and they didn't want to admit that which

2030
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:54,299
to me was you know uh

2031
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:55,679
a fundamental issue in in in scientific

2032
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,840
work like

2033
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,119
you know a scientist has to be able to

2034
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,980
go oh there's an anomaly here okay well

2035
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:05,460
let's look into that as opposed to going

2036
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:07,379
no our our technique is sound it's like

2037
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,000
hey you know

2038
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,980
you have to be able to throw everything

2039
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,140
away that you thought right now

2040
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:16,079
everything you know if you want to be

2041
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:17,280
actual you know if you want to be a real

2042
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,559
scientist

2043
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:22,439
you have to be able to to be able to be

2044
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:24,480
handed new evidence and be able to throw

2045
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:27,178
away every [ __ ] thing you knew

2046
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:29,099
yesterday and go we have a new

2047
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:32,039
understanding today that's what science

2048
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:34,679
is otherwise if you if you just cling to

2049
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:37,859
thinking you're right that's that's not

2050
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:41,219
what science is Science is based on you

2051
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:43,859
know science science is is uh is data

2052
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:47,819
driven you know and evidence driven it's

2053
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:50,460
not based on you know just thinking that

2054
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:52,500
if it's if it's if it's like this it's

2055
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:54,480
like this it's like no this evidence

2056
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,698
says it's not like this but

2057
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,678
anyway you know so those are the issues

2058
01:21:56,698 --> 01:22:03,000
that I see with their thing

2059
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:05,100
um I see issues with them ethically

2060
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,380
um because of what they did they

2061
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:10,140
basically told the community this this

2062
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:13,020
data is completely worthless

2063
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:14,960
and they told their investors this data

2064
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:18,120
is completely priceless

2065
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,980
and one of those things is a lie so

2066
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:21,420
either you're lying to your investors or

2067
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:25,439
you're lying to the people who are

2068
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:28,319
paying you to do analysis and

2069
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:30,178
um you know I think they were not lying

2070
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,880
to the investors I think that they were

2071
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:34,800
creating a data set that was actually a

2072
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,440
valuable

2073
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,659
um a valuable thing because

2074
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,339
you know we we don't really know the

2075
01:22:39,658 --> 01:22:43,198
other stuff that they were doing besides

2076
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:44,940
that little Galaxy stuff they also could

2077
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:46,559
be putting things together and they said

2078
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:48,899
it's worthless because we don't know

2079
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,820
about the plants so if you don't have

2080
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:53,579
the plant you don't know what it is but

2081
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:55,559
it's like ah so you don't already have a

2082
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:57,960
description of an OG

2083
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,420
like they do have a description of what

2084
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,880
it is and when they can find these

2085
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:05,460
things that pop up commonly they could

2086
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:08,640
find markers and they could do Marker

2087
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:10,920
assisted breeding and they could use

2088
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,719
that data to drive their breeding

2089
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,579
program which they basically admitted

2090
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,439
was what they were going to do

2091
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:18,719
and uh

2092
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:21,000
you know that's that seems like some

2093
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,100
[ __ ] to me but at the same time like

2094
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,039
I said I'm not completely against giving

2095
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:27,239
him something it's just that when you

2096
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:29,219
give them something they should be

2097
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:30,899
saying hey you give us something and

2098
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:32,698
you're going to pay us money and we're

2099
01:23:30,899 --> 01:23:35,879
gonna make money off what you give us

2100
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:37,198
too and for me I'm like yeah I mean I

2101
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,520
maybe I'll give you something but I

2102
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,019
don't want to pay you because you guys

2103
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,800
are already making money on the back end

2104
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:46,679
so [ __ ] that you know that's my take on

2105
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:48,539
their on their operation

2106
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:51,119
I think a lot of people will rightly

2107
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:53,460
feel the same way as you and uh it's

2108
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:55,679
kind of quite backroom Shady practices

2109
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:57,359
all the trying to selling of the data

2110
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,800
they did I think I heard or read

2111
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,599
somewhere probably read somewhere like

2112
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,539
they tried to sell

2113
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:05,760
the data set to a big ad company and

2114
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,859
because of the exact reasons you kind of

2115
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,020
discussed the big AG were like this data

2116
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:11,519
is useless like it's incomplete but it's

2117
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,560
just kind of funny that they might have

2118
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,500
like screwed over themselves in all

2119
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:18,179
regards

2120
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:21,479
yeah I

2121
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:26,279
I mean I kind of feel like that's their

2122
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:28,559
story is that the data was incomplete

2123
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:30,658
and worthless

2124
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,480
um and that that's what they said to

2125
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:35,698
cover their ass and once again like I I

2126
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:37,079
can't say that that's true or that it's

2127
01:24:35,698 --> 01:24:39,899
untrue

2128
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:42,600
but

2129
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:45,179
I kind of feel like

2130
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,520
if they had a pretty thorough analysis

2131
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:49,920
of all these different things I feel

2132
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,500
like there's probably

2133
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:55,980
a way that they could have looked at

2134
01:24:52,500 --> 01:25:01,698
commonalities between certain

2135
01:24:55,979 --> 01:25:01,698
things and seen a trend enough to know

2136
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,600
if they did a little research that oh

2137
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:08,158
these are the strains that are powdery

2138
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:11,400
mildew resistant

2139
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:14,698
and look they all have this in common

2140
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:17,039
and these are the strains that are high

2141
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:18,719
THC and they all have this in common

2142
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:20,399
these are just examples I don't know

2143
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,980
that they would really need any of this

2144
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:25,259
yeah yeah but

2145
01:25:22,979 --> 01:25:28,619
I feel like if they collected that many

2146
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:30,900
plants and they say oh well you have to

2147
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:33,000
have the plant to be able to know what

2148
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:35,039
these things mean

2149
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,500
I feel like you don't really necessarily

2150
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:40,579
have to I think all you would really

2151
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:44,039
have to do is know

2152
01:25:40,579 --> 01:25:45,899
the outward features of the phenotypes

2153
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:48,300
of these plants

2154
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:50,219
and be able to see trends

2155
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:52,260
you know what I mean

2156
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:55,020
to be able to say these are the genes

2157
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:57,659
that rule potency these are the genes

2158
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:59,580
that rule high terpene content these are

2159
01:25:57,658 --> 01:26:03,479
the genes that rule mold resistance

2160
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:05,460
these are the genes that rule

2161
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:08,759
um that control

2162
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:13,260
um fast rooting these are the genes that

2163
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:15,420
that that control fast uh you know the

2164
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:16,679
the fastest maturing

2165
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,020
um samples

2166
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:21,119
like those things aren't that hard it's

2167
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:25,080
not that hard to to find those things

2168
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:26,579
out in my opinion you know to know like

2169
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:28,380
um

2170
01:26:26,579 --> 01:26:31,380
you know I mean I don't know how much of

2171
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:33,420
that they really got but it it's just I

2172
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:34,679
don't know I I feel like they're they're

2173
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:36,739
they're

2174
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:36,739
um

2175
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,920
even if it was worthless to them they

2176
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:42,000
could have made it worth something you

2177
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:45,119
know

2178
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,579
I don't know it's just a

2179
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:49,500
just a theory but

2180
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:51,960
you know I mean I feel like you could

2181
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:53,579
kind of go through and and do a little

2182
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,319
research and go oh what's good about

2183
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:57,300
this plant what's good about that plant

2184
01:26:55,319 --> 01:27:00,479
what's good about this one and put that

2185
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:02,159
all into your program and go oh these

2186
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:03,959
all have this in common and look hey

2187
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:05,819
they have these markers

2188
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,819
this is the thing they all share in

2189
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:12,719
common so that must be it must be this

2190
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:15,359
gene or it must be these you know 32

2191
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:17,579
genes these control this when they're

2192
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,359
all when they're all here that may that

2193
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:23,579
means you get this this is purple weed

2194
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:25,500
this is mold proof weed or whatever it

2195
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:27,059
is because that's what you know that's

2196
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,679
what other people went through and did

2197
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,480
they went okay this is the gene that

2198
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:31,199
controls

2199
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:34,619
um

2200
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:37,138
THC and then they got rid of that and

2201
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:39,420
they went oh [ __ ] that was also the gene

2202
01:27:37,139 --> 01:27:42,420
that controlled mold resistance so when

2203
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:44,279
you get rid of the THC to make hemp then

2204
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:47,100
you just destroyed mold resistance so

2205
01:27:44,279 --> 01:27:49,500
now all these people who have this who

2206
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:52,079
who spent this money to in their

2207
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:54,840
breeding program to go oh well our hemp

2208
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,460
will never have THC because we went

2209
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,079
right around that Gene we don't even

2210
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,300
have that Gene present in this

2211
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:03,119
population then they grew it and they

2212
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:04,980
found out oh [ __ ] that also adds mold

2213
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,840
resistance so they had all this perfect

2214
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:08,579
temp that all rotted in the fields

2215
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:10,800
because they had completely eliminated

2216
01:28:08,579 --> 01:28:13,619
it when they just needed to figure out

2217
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:16,560
how to minimize thca they eliminated

2218
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:19,800
thca and all their crops rotted you know

2219
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:24,780
so however those guys went about getting

2220
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:26,579
that data I would imagine that philos

2221
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:28,559
could have done the same thing with all

2222
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:30,300
the samples they had as they analyzed

2223
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,039
them as well you know I mean I don't

2224
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,760
know but it just seems like that would

2225
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:35,460
be

2226
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:37,980
a practical thing to do with such a huge

2227
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:39,480
collection of various genetics you know

2228
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,919
I don't know how many samples they took

2229
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:42,359
them but it was a lot they have a pretty

2230
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,920
big Galaxy

2231
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:46,259
but there'd definitely be some Trends

2232
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,079
there I think it's called concordance of

2233
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,940
like traits or something but um

2234
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:53,399
definitely definitely still valid points

2235
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:56,279
kind of on that same topic of being a

2236
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:58,138
bit skeptical of sort of bigger AG big

2237
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:01,500
companies in general I remember about

2238
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:03,119
four or five years ago when um wreck in

2239
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,760
Cali rolled through there was this big

2240
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:08,460
fear that like the big sort of companies

2241
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,500
were going to come in and just build

2242
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:13,198
these huge facilities just pump out

2243
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:15,658
Production Drive the prices down and you

2244
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:17,219
know everyone was going to lose it seems

2245
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:19,019
as though over the past year or two

2246
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:20,698
we've seen kind of the opposite in that

2247
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,500
I mean at least in Canada for example

2248
01:29:20,698 --> 01:29:24,299
some of the biggest producers are just

2249
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,979
failing and just losing I think the

2250
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,560
industry lost billions of dollars over

2251
01:29:25,979 --> 01:29:31,559
the past Financial year and I know that

2252
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:33,719
there aren't any notably big companies

2253
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:35,280
in the states who are just on top of the

2254
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:37,920
game like they're all kind of producing

2255
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:39,899
lesser quality stuff do you think that

2256
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,279
this is like an accurate sort of

2257
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:42,299
portrayal of things do you think like

2258
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:44,519
the bigger companies are going to

2259
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:46,500
generally continue to struggle to

2260
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:48,000
produce good quality product

2261
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,979
and do you think that the small time

2262
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,840
producers will have a chance to jump

2263
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:55,198
back into the game

2264
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,699
well it's an interesting thing

2265
01:29:55,198 --> 01:30:00,059
and I probably shouldn't even really

2266
01:29:56,698 --> 01:30:03,539
tell them but the the the the people who

2267
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:06,840
had the big bucks and could afford to

2268
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:08,639
bully their way into the market

2269
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,739
I think they could have probably done

2270
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:14,760
all right if they would have come in and

2271
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:18,178
understood that you need to have minimal

2272
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:20,960
investment in infrastructure and minimal

2273
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,960
investment

2274
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,960
um in you know in in various aspects but

2275
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:30,238
really focused on okay

2276
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:33,000
who can we get that can really grow weed

2277
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,259
that already grows weed how do they do

2278
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,020
it

2279
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:39,119
and let's invest in them

2280
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,400
and give them the ability to grow more

2281
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:43,198
weed

2282
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:45,599
um

2283
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:47,759
and then kind of rolled with it but

2284
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,039
instead what they kind of tried to do it

2285
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,560
seems

2286
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:55,019
uh it seems like they came in and they

2287
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,239
went okay we have money and this was no

2288
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:59,100
shock to anybody but

2289
01:30:57,238 --> 01:31:00,959
we have a lot of money

2290
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:05,159
will come in

2291
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,719
and we will do everything the way all

2292
01:31:05,158 --> 01:31:08,519
these dumbasses should have been doing

2293
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,679
it but they're all dumb dope Growers

2294
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:12,300
they don't know how to do this [ __ ]

2295
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:14,100
we're going to come in here with a real

2296
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:16,320
professional [ __ ] we're going to build

2297
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,760
this 250 million dollar Greenhouse

2298
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:21,738
complex

2299
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:24,539
then we're gonna get a bunch of [ __ ]

2300
01:31:21,738 --> 01:31:27,359
random people and we're just going to

2301
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:29,880
tell them how to do it because

2302
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:31,380
it's just a plant and people grow plants

2303
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:33,719
all the time and we're gonna we're gonna

2304
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:34,619
be bigger and better

2305
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:37,439
um

2306
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:39,599
and I you know I think they just kind of

2307
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,519
dropped the ball with that mentality it

2308
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,679
seems like I mean I'm not on the inside

2309
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,000
but

2310
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,800
um

2311
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,960
it's nuts because I see the facilities

2312
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,880
that they built out and I'm like you

2313
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,500
know guys you could have just instead of

2314
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,440
building those [ __ ]

2315
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:57,539
you know 150 greenhouses you guys could

2316
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:59,939
have just built like four of them

2317
01:31:57,539 --> 01:32:01,920
and got a guy who's used to growing like

2318
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:04,138
a quarter of that and got him some good

2319
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,000
help where he could just point point

2320
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:08,639
fingers and tell him tell tell the

2321
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,800
workers what to do

2322
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,619
um and they could have they could have

2323
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,779
taken you know somebody's existing

2324
01:32:13,619 --> 01:32:18,420
expertise and scaled it up by giving

2325
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:21,119
them the ability to do that

2326
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:24,480
and it would work and I feel like that's

2327
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,340
kind of what the little guys did

2328
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,319
um

2329
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:30,000
because

2330
01:32:27,319 --> 01:32:31,198
they had a better idea of how [ __ ]

2331
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,719
really works

2332
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:34,859
and so I think it gave them the

2333
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:36,300
advantage

2334
01:32:34,859 --> 01:32:37,979
um and when I say little guys I don't

2335
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:40,860
mean little little guys but I mean like

2336
01:32:37,979 --> 01:32:42,959
you know jungle boys or whoever seems to

2337
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:44,759
be kind of hanging in there

2338
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:48,960
um

2339
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,960
it just seems like uh

2340
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:54,000
it's a really hard thing to do if you're

2341
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:56,340
just gonna come in from the outside and

2342
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,899
just have it work and I mean I I could

2343
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:00,060
tell you that because I know what it was

2344
01:32:57,899 --> 01:33:04,439
like to try to figure it out it wasn't

2345
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:06,420
easy and um you know I did a lot of dumb

2346
01:33:04,439 --> 01:33:08,638
[ __ ] when I started and you think you

2347
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:10,679
can try this and you know you know what

2348
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:13,739
to do you know what you're doing and

2349
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:16,380
then you're like huh okay

2350
01:33:13,738 --> 01:33:18,359
well that didn't work but at least I

2351
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:20,520
didn't invest 300 million dollars into

2352
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:22,259
it and then it didn't work because when

2353
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,820
you do that it's like well how are you

2354
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:25,619
gonna you know everybody thought they'll

2355
01:33:23,819 --> 01:33:26,698
just have endless money to put into it

2356
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:28,380
but

2357
01:33:26,698 --> 01:33:29,279
they you know they don't have that much

2358
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:30,900
money

2359
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:34,019
you know

2360
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:36,960
um so

2361
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:37,679
yeah I don't know I I think everything I

2362
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,139
think

2363
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:42,539
in general the way

2364
01:33:40,139 --> 01:33:44,880
everything works is everything's kind of

2365
01:33:42,539 --> 01:33:48,600
designed for

2366
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:51,480
the bigger people to do the best

2367
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:54,000
and they still have the advantage

2368
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:56,158
and

2369
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,279
they came in and did stuff so miserably

2370
01:33:56,158 --> 01:34:01,619
that they still [ __ ] it off

2371
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:03,899
and uh

2372
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:05,639
you know I mean I don't know I mean the

2373
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:07,379
way the way everything's set up is like

2374
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:09,960
if you're the big if you're the big

2375
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:12,359
company if you're Walmart if you're

2376
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,000
Amazon if you're Costco if you're

2377
01:34:12,359 --> 01:34:19,319
whatever the biggest things are that's

2378
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:22,679
the easiest things in these times

2379
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:24,840
to really have be like

2380
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:26,420
sustainable and keep going you know like

2381
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,319
the bigger the better

2382
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,819
and

2383
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:31,439
um

2384
01:34:29,819 --> 01:34:33,179
if you look at though with the way those

2385
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:35,158
things operate though it's like they

2386
01:34:33,179 --> 01:34:36,658
really figure out okay what are what are

2387
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:38,939
we really trying to do what kind of

2388
01:34:36,658 --> 01:34:42,359
service are we bring in

2389
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:44,158
um you know it's like they they figure

2390
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:47,639
it out and then they get it right I'm

2391
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:48,960
sure a lot of people tried and failed

2392
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:51,960
um there was probably a lot of

2393
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,219
competitors to Amazon or to Walmart at

2394
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,319
the same time

2395
01:34:53,219 --> 01:34:57,119
but um

2396
01:34:55,319 --> 01:34:58,859
you know maybe we'll see that maybe

2397
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:00,000
there'll be this one company that

2398
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:03,658
actually didn't

2399
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,219
you know [ __ ] everything off but um

2400
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:07,638
I don't know at this point it's looking

2401
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:07,639
like

2402
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:10,439
um

2403
01:35:08,698 --> 01:35:12,419
you know they're making it really hard

2404
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:14,460
for the little guy but the little guy

2405
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:15,899
still understands what it's like to do

2406
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:18,179
something that's really [ __ ] hard

2407
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:20,339
because that's what they're used to and

2408
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:23,158
the big guys

2409
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:25,319
are maybe a little a little too

2410
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:26,939
comfortable with how they did stuff you

2411
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:28,439
know I don't really know like I said I'm

2412
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:31,138
not in the inside of it so I don't know

2413
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:33,658
exactly what goes wrong but I do I do

2414
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:34,980
see what goes right for people and it's

2415
01:35:33,658 --> 01:35:38,219
usually

2416
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:41,039
you know a guy who's good at doing

2417
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:43,439
20 lights so he goes we're going to do

2418
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,960
200 lights and I'm going to hire six

2419
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:47,819
guys and then they you know they're able

2420
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,039
to they're able to do it they keep it

2421
01:35:47,819 --> 01:35:52,439
going and and it's able to work you know

2422
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:54,300
as opposed to somebody who's used to

2423
01:35:52,439 --> 01:35:57,719
running zero lights and they decide

2424
01:35:54,300 --> 01:36:00,840
they're going to do 2600 lights and

2425
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:03,480
then you know they're just [ __ ] it's

2426
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,940
a it's a weird thing it's really easy to

2427
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:08,039
have huge disasters when you're trying

2428
01:36:05,939 --> 01:36:10,319
to grow plants and then it's not like

2429
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:13,439
it's even regular agriculture it's this

2430
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:16,738
weird massive Horticulture in a sense

2431
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:18,119
because it's you're growing indoor on a

2432
01:36:16,738 --> 01:36:20,698
huge scale

2433
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:22,559
in these greenhouses it's a I don't know

2434
01:36:20,698 --> 01:36:25,198
it's a weird it's a weird thing I mean

2435
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:28,320
the pressure in those operations from

2436
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:30,899
pests and pathogens and stuff is huge

2437
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:33,779
and then it's all you know it's mono

2438
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:36,238
cropping and there's a lot of room for a

2439
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:38,880
lot of room for error so you know

2440
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:42,619
hopefully the little guys can continue

2441
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,619
to make it it just seems like it's

2442
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,579
it's almost impossible for the big guys

2443
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,560
to do it and then they try to make it

2444
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:52,979
really really hard for the little guys

2445
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:57,600
to get their foot in the door and um you

2446
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:59,459
know like I it's just this kind of

2447
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,079
um kind of [ __ ] up balance of stuff

2448
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:04,619
you know but um

2449
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:06,059
you know I I hope I hope it's the the

2450
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:08,939
little guys went out and the big guys

2451
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:10,739
can't make it you know and um that would

2452
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:13,138
be great but we'll you know we'll see

2453
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:16,198
where it's going it's really interesting

2454
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:17,400
to see I'm really happy to see like you

2455
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:19,439
know you looking on something and

2456
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:21,299
they're like oh 250 million dollar

2457
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:23,698
greenhouses and they're just shutting

2458
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:28,020
them down they're not going to reopen

2459
01:37:23,698 --> 01:37:30,419
them like wow okay sweet because uh

2460
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:32,639
you know nobody needed that [ __ ] that

2461
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:33,899
was a weird that was a weird play in the

2462
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,880
first place like what are they going to

2463
01:37:33,899 --> 01:37:37,979
produce out of that

2464
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:39,779
there's going to be a bunch of you know

2465
01:37:37,979 --> 01:37:42,059
it's weird it's like an operation to

2466
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:43,800
make really good weed but it's on such a

2467
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:46,380
big scale it'll never make really good

2468
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,600
weed so the same dudes who did that they

2469
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:51,060
should have just planted [ __ ] 150

2470
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,340
acres of hemp and sold CBD all over the

2471
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:55,980
world or something but

2472
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:57,779
um instead they spend a million times as

2473
01:37:55,979 --> 01:38:00,059
much money and then

2474
01:37:57,779 --> 01:38:03,000
they you know

2475
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:05,760
frazzle out it's a weird uh

2476
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,979
it's it's it's silly you know it's a

2477
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,679
funny thing to watch

2478
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:14,158
yeah understandable and do you think

2479
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:17,039
that the average grower or consumer is

2480
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:19,439
in any better position after the changes

2481
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:22,260
brought in with legalization and if you

2482
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:26,158
could make say a couple of small changes

2483
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:28,260
to the laws that would ideally improve

2484
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:29,759
you know the lives of Growers are there

2485
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:32,039
any that immediately jump to mind that

2486
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,539
you'd want to do I remember that for a

2487
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:35,760
long time there was the discussion about

2488
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:37,800
the uh I think it was like the one acre

2489
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,900
per Farm sort of thing do you have any

2490
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:43,679
ideas like that

2491
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:45,000
I mean my opinion of the whole thing is

2492
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:49,020
that

2493
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:51,960
they already know how crazy the economy

2494
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:55,920
is fed by

2495
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:57,779
cannabis in general it's huge

2496
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:01,380
um

2497
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:03,658
I felt like if they would have made it

2498
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,760
so that you can have weed stores but if

2499
01:39:03,658 --> 01:39:07,859
you want a store you have to sell safe

2500
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,619
tested product

2501
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:13,738
and if you want to sell at a store you

2502
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:14,579
have to have safe tested product

2503
01:39:13,738 --> 01:39:16,439
um

2504
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:19,800
and then maybe make one little

2505
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:22,319
regulation that

2506
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,060
um it's illegal to sell something that

2507
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:25,738
has something that's toxic and make a

2508
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:27,600
list you know

2509
01:39:25,738 --> 01:39:29,099
so that there's some kind of recourse if

2510
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,780
it turns out that somebody oh these

2511
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,280
people are selling all this stuff and it

2512
01:39:30,779 --> 01:39:34,079
turns out oh it's poisoned or whatever

2513
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:34,859
you know

2514
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:36,960
um

2515
01:39:34,859 --> 01:39:38,579
but I felt like if they would have just

2516
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,420
kind of made it so that it's like oh

2517
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:41,760
cool

2518
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:44,158
everybody can do what they want but it

2519
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:48,119
is capped you know like uh

2520
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:50,460
maybe if you want to grow more than 100

2521
01:39:48,119 --> 01:39:52,139
plants you need to have a permit

2522
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:54,420
or something like that you know what I

2523
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:55,619
mean like if if you're going to produce

2524
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:57,779
more than

2525
01:39:55,619 --> 01:39:59,460
100 pounds a year then you have to have

2526
01:39:57,779 --> 01:40:01,019
a permit but you can go ahead and just

2527
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,760
produce that because it's just it's

2528
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:04,199
[ __ ] weed it's pretty much harmless

2529
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,820
you know

2530
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:08,339
um it's pretty low impact if you're not

2531
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:09,960
growing a ton and then if you do want to

2532
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:12,659
grow a whole lot of weed then cool get a

2533
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:14,520
permit you know but basically like I I

2534
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:16,439
think you know this is just me throwing

2535
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:18,900
it out there and I'm not sitting down in

2536
01:40:16,439 --> 01:40:20,279
a in a room and we're not writing it all

2537
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:21,619
down and figuring out what's really the

2538
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:24,179
best but

2539
01:40:21,619 --> 01:40:26,760
I think stuff could have been kind of

2540
01:40:24,179 --> 01:40:28,679
more just just more vague like that

2541
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,239
being that we already had a functioning

2542
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:33,300
system

2543
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:34,979
of people growing weed and smoking weed

2544
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,079
and selling weed and I wasn't hearing

2545
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:40,439
about people having a bunch of bad

2546
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:42,899
experiences from bad weed or

2547
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:44,638
any of this kind of stuff the the only

2548
01:40:42,899 --> 01:40:47,879
stuff I can find that's really bad about

2549
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:51,119
wheat is prohibition you get busted or

2550
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:53,400
the price gets artificially inflated

2551
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,658
which causes a lot of crime because now

2552
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:57,119
there's too much money in the business

2553
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:59,158
that wouldn't exist if

2554
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:00,840
it was legal because everything would

2555
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:03,960
level out a lot of people wouldn't be

2556
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:06,239
doing it and a lot of people who

2557
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:07,920
have no opportunities who find

2558
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:10,678
themselves in weird positions doing

2559
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:12,420
shady [ __ ] they could just [ __ ] sell

2560
01:41:10,679 --> 01:41:15,000
some weed instead

2561
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:17,039
you know if you have

2562
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,899
a neighborhood where people are all just

2563
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:21,119
hanging out like [ __ ] you can have a

2564
01:41:18,899 --> 01:41:23,039
couple people selling sacks there and

2565
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:24,599
you know you might have somebody selling

2566
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:27,479
this weed this person's selling that

2567
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:28,079
weed like it's a really great

2568
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:30,779
um

2569
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,819
tool for any economy because people want

2570
01:41:30,779 --> 01:41:35,219
weed it's good for them does a lot of

2571
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:37,259
good stuff makes people feel good people

2572
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:39,658
are interested in it so it's not like

2573
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:42,900
one is the same as all of it it's not

2574
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:44,638
like selling hard drugs where one

2575
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:46,618
person's hard drugs the same as any

2576
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,020
other hard drug like it's not like

2577
01:41:46,618 --> 01:41:51,118
people want a different flavor of heroin

2578
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:53,520
or a different flavor of crack they just

2579
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:55,799
are trying to get it so one person can

2580
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:58,560
lock down the whole trade but with weed

2581
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,539
it's like oh well yeah that person might

2582
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,639
have locked down OG but this guy doesn't

2583
01:42:00,539 --> 01:42:05,279
like OG wants sour well this guy over

2584
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:08,279
here he's selling sour and

2585
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:11,340
it's as an economy it's really a lot

2586
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:13,439
more it's like such a neat thing the way

2587
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:15,360
it exists

2588
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,460
um for people it can be used for a lot

2589
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:20,158
so like for me it's like

2590
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:22,139
make it legal and if people do other

2591
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:24,599
[ __ ] that's already a crime with it

2592
01:42:22,139 --> 01:42:26,819
maybe you'd have to add like I said okay

2593
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:27,840
well you're selling unsafe weed that's

2594
01:42:26,819 --> 01:42:30,118
not

2595
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,800
uh there's no law for that because all

2596
01:42:30,118 --> 01:42:33,359
weed's illegal but you make it legal you

2597
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:35,400
go well it has to be safe weed maybe

2598
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:36,420
make that you know some kind of a

2599
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:38,819
offense

2600
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:41,039
but other than that like

2601
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:42,719
you know like hey you rob somebody for

2602
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:47,100
weed well [ __ ] it's already illegal to

2603
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:49,079
rob somebody oh you [ __ ] you know you

2604
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:50,880
smoked weed and you drove something and

2605
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:52,920
you [ __ ] drove somebody off the road

2606
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:55,020
[ __ ] because you're not used to it or

2607
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,399
you ate some crazy Edibles and passed

2608
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:57,840
out or some [ __ ] which probably wouldn't

2609
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,519
happen but that's what people are afraid

2610
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,460
of but sweet it's already [ __ ]

2611
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,040
illegal so like there's no reason for

2612
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:07,800
just a drug to carry a crime for the

2613
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:10,618
drug just make all the dumb [ __ ] people

2614
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:12,600
do that's illegal that's what's [ __ ]

2615
01:43:10,618 --> 01:43:15,299
illegal you know that's all that's the

2616
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:17,340
only way you really have to do stuff

2617
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:19,260
um the way that they did everything with

2618
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:21,480
so much regulation and everything it

2619
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:23,699
just it's to me it's just backwards from

2620
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:26,158
the start like you got a plant

2621
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:29,638
let people grow the plant

2622
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:31,920
and then you know like when everybody

2623
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:35,600
was making tons of of money it's funny

2624
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:38,219
because they go okay we want to get

2625
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,780
uh we want to get our money from the

2626
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:41,939
taxes and everybody goes yeah that's

2627
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:43,920
good the tax money the tax money that's

2628
01:43:41,939 --> 01:43:45,719
like well when weed was illegal but

2629
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,699
everybody was making billions of dollars

2630
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:49,198
off of it in California because they say

2631
01:43:47,698 --> 01:43:52,259
it's like a 10 billion dollar business

2632
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:54,719
or something in California well

2633
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:57,300
the state was realistically already

2634
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,800
making probably a billion dollars just

2635
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,679
off a sales tax

2636
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:03,420
and every time there's a tax on all

2637
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:05,158
these other things that are on all these

2638
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:07,859
different things like you know you've

2639
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:12,658
got different taxes that go into you got

2640
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:15,658
Hotel taxes you got gas tax you got

2641
01:44:12,658 --> 01:44:18,658
tobacco tax you got all these things

2642
01:44:15,658 --> 01:44:21,539
well guess where the money comes from

2643
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:23,158
that is getting taxed when you buy all

2644
01:44:21,539 --> 01:44:24,300
these things it's coming from a lot of

2645
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:26,279
weed trade

2646
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:28,440
so

2647
01:44:26,279 --> 01:44:30,300
now they're like oh yeah we're doing

2648
01:44:28,439 --> 01:44:32,039
good we made a billion dollars in

2649
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:35,219
California off the weed trade this year

2650
01:44:32,039 --> 01:44:38,760
I'm like well but you just they say 8.7

2651
01:44:35,219 --> 01:44:40,980
billion that they didn't tax

2652
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:42,900
so I'm like well if it was 10 billion

2653
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:45,359
and you guys already had eight percent

2654
01:44:42,899 --> 01:44:46,979
sales tax plus all these other random

2655
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:48,479
taxes that are all worked into

2656
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:50,879
everything some of them that are high

2657
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:53,218
like hotel rooms in San Francisco is

2658
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,500
like 22 percent and [ __ ] hotel tax like

2659
01:44:53,219 --> 01:44:57,658
all these things that are producing all

2660
01:44:55,500 --> 01:45:01,460
this stuff the money is all coming from

2661
01:44:57,658 --> 01:45:04,799
it I'm like well sweet so now you guys

2662
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:06,300
are getting your billion dollars but

2663
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,159
you've always been getting the [ __ ]

2664
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,719
billion dollars if the trade is 10

2665
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:12,299
billion dollars and you guys have been

2666
01:45:09,719 --> 01:45:14,579
getting 10 of everybody's money not to

2667
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,659
mention everybody who was who has a

2668
01:45:14,579 --> 01:45:18,479
business

2669
01:45:15,658 --> 01:45:19,979
and has a like you got a restaurant the

2670
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:21,299
people coming into your restaurant a

2671
01:45:19,979 --> 01:45:23,879
bunch of them are spending weed money

2672
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:26,279
well the owner of that restaurant pays

2673
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,679
income tax you know a lot of these

2674
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:30,238
people who grow weed and have money they

2675
01:45:28,679 --> 01:45:32,460
might be they might have a they might

2676
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:35,039
have another business and that business

2677
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:36,539
is paying income tax there's all this

2678
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:38,460
stuff where there's all this different

2679
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:39,539
[ __ ] going on and by having a healthy

2680
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:41,279
economy

2681
01:45:39,539 --> 01:45:42,658
they're making billions of dollars

2682
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:47,158
anyway

2683
01:45:42,658 --> 01:45:49,618
so they just want to be able to count it

2684
01:45:47,158 --> 01:45:51,779
but it's like nobody realizes they were

2685
01:45:49,618 --> 01:45:53,819
already getting a billion dollars now

2686
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:56,519
they're like we made a billion dollars

2687
01:45:53,819 --> 01:45:58,679
off of weed this year it's like you you

2688
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:01,679
know same [ __ ] old billion dollars

2689
01:45:58,679 --> 01:46:03,840
except now there's a bunch of people who

2690
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,539
you know are uh

2691
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:09,179
you know not not you know and then I

2692
01:46:06,539 --> 01:46:11,100
gotta wonder about the the biggest the

2693
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:12,480
biggest corporations and [ __ ] who are do

2694
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:15,539
have these 250 million dollar

2695
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:17,399
greenhouses like those people might be

2696
01:46:15,539 --> 01:46:19,439
paying the taxes

2697
01:46:17,399 --> 01:46:22,679
on

2698
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:26,158
stuff now and on like the weed and

2699
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:27,779
everything but as soon as they were in

2700
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:29,519
the game for a little while and they

2701
01:46:27,779 --> 01:46:31,139
Lobby for [ __ ] to change and all this

2702
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,300
and those little [ __ ] rules and

2703
01:46:31,139 --> 01:46:35,420
loopholes and their [ __ ] fancy

2704
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:37,440
[ __ ] attorneys and all this [ __ ]

2705
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:39,179
those people probably would have been

2706
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:42,178
just like all the other rich people who

2707
01:46:39,179 --> 01:46:42,980
don't really [ __ ] pay taxes anyway

2708
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:46,739
um

2709
01:46:42,979 --> 01:46:48,419
so why give it to them you know and the

2710
01:46:46,738 --> 01:46:49,799
rich people don't spend money at the

2711
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:52,440
little businesses

2712
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:55,020
the rich people don't the the money

2713
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:56,279
doesn't really [ __ ] you know or

2714
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:58,860
whereas talking to the talking about

2715
01:46:56,279 --> 01:47:00,899
this the other night on this with some

2716
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:02,279
buddies on a on a zoom thing like the

2717
01:47:00,899 --> 01:47:05,460
money

2718
01:47:02,279 --> 01:47:07,800
the money from Little People

2719
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:09,899
who have their little weed or their

2720
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,460
little business or whatever they do that

2721
01:47:09,899 --> 01:47:13,559
are you know they they don't make that

2722
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:16,319
much money that money goes everywhere

2723
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:18,060
not only does it go into the not only do

2724
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:20,939
they walk into the little liquor store

2725
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:23,760
the little the little General Store the

2726
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:26,099
grocery store the clothing store the

2727
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,139
restaurant all this different [ __ ] they

2728
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:29,639
do all that and then they also pay the

2729
01:47:28,139 --> 01:47:31,380
money that goes to the government and

2730
01:47:29,639 --> 01:47:34,980
then okay it's going up to these people

2731
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:36,840
who have more and the people who you

2732
01:47:34,979 --> 01:47:39,959
know it's also going to Walmart and

2733
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:42,960
Amazon and these bigger corporations too

2734
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:44,579
but you don't see you're not going to

2735
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,158
see

2736
01:47:44,579 --> 01:47:51,000
um Bezos or Gates or any of these really

2737
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:53,399
rich people their money doesn't go to

2738
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,139
the little businesses it's just not how

2739
01:47:53,399 --> 01:47:57,000
it works they're not taking their money

2740
01:47:55,139 --> 01:47:58,739
and going and shopping at the little

2741
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,658
store they're not going and buying their

2742
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:03,178
clothes at the little store they're not

2743
01:48:00,658 --> 01:48:05,099
doing the money from up there never

2744
01:48:03,179 --> 01:48:08,880
comes back down but the money from the

2745
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:12,300
bottom goes up so you really want the

2746
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:15,900
[ __ ] to be healthy on a small level and

2747
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:18,719
it'll feed the big level you know but

2748
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:21,238
the way the whole system is set up is to

2749
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:23,579
favor those bigger players and their

2750
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:25,799
their [ __ ] doesn't go down so it just

2751
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:28,079
it's not a

2752
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:30,360
it's not a healthy model and it's not a

2753
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:31,139
real form of capitalism

2754
01:48:30,359 --> 01:48:33,779
um

2755
01:48:31,139 --> 01:48:36,539
it's just a weird it's a weird perverted

2756
01:48:33,779 --> 01:48:40,679
capitalism that's more uh

2757
01:48:36,539 --> 01:48:43,380
predatory and like it's more like uh

2758
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:45,658
more like Barons and peasants you know

2759
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:46,560
so

2760
01:48:45,658 --> 01:48:48,539
um

2761
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:52,080
you know hopefully we see that hopefully

2762
01:48:48,539 --> 01:48:54,840
the small guys can can can do well and

2763
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,399
it can shift a little and we see you

2764
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:58,319
know maybe it's one thing where like

2765
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:01,019
they have the advantage and it pans out

2766
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:03,179
over time and I think it can but like

2767
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:05,100
that's a that's a crazy thing I don't

2768
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:05,760
think that there's any

2769
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:08,219
um

2770
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:12,060
there's any point to trying to you know

2771
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:14,579
feed these these these uh fat cats when

2772
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:16,500
they're not really the the money goes

2773
01:49:14,579 --> 01:49:20,399
with them and it stays with them

2774
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:22,139
and if you uh if the money comes from

2775
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:24,000
the from the little guys the money goes

2776
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:27,300
everywhere it goes all around and it

2777
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,158
goes up to the top too so that's in my

2778
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:31,079
opinion just on looking at things and

2779
01:49:29,158 --> 01:49:32,939
through history and what's been helpful

2780
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:34,920
and uh

2781
01:49:32,939 --> 01:49:36,599
mechanically what works you know the

2782
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,158
whole trickle-down [ __ ] is total

2783
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:40,679
[ __ ]

2784
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:44,759
um and and having a small having a

2785
01:49:40,679 --> 01:49:47,639
healthy economy on the on the small

2786
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,800
um level and the little guys is where

2787
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:51,600
things really go and just by leaving

2788
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:54,600
people to do whatever they wanted with

2789
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:56,219
weed like it was basically in 215 if

2790
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:59,340
they would have basically just stopped

2791
01:49:56,219 --> 01:50:00,840
putting people in jail

2792
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:03,960
um and tell people you can't sell

2793
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:06,119
poisonous weed pretty much with it

2794
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,340
solved the whole thing and maybe one day

2795
01:50:06,118 --> 01:50:10,198
we'll get to that point you know and if

2796
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:12,000
that if if we got to that point that's

2797
01:50:10,198 --> 01:50:14,638
when I would say okay that's where it

2798
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,800
should be it's um if you want to have a

2799
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:19,260
big business cool maybe you need to be

2800
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,639
regulated because you're big but if you

2801
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:22,199
just got a little bit of weed you should

2802
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:23,760
just be able to do whatever the [ __ ] you

2803
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:26,579
want with it in my opinion you know

2804
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:30,239
totally and what an insightful sort of

2805
01:50:26,579 --> 01:50:32,819
uh take on the whole situation if we

2806
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:35,459
kind of look at uh one of the people who

2807
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:37,559
the public sometimes forget are in fact

2808
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:40,139
uh one of the smaller guys we reference

2809
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:42,420
jungle boys they're certainly doing

2810
01:50:40,139 --> 01:50:44,279
things right and uh getting a little

2811
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:46,739
bigger but still smaller guys compared

2812
01:50:44,279 --> 01:50:48,658
to the big AG I wanted to bring them up

2813
01:50:46,738 --> 01:50:50,039
because recently an interview came out

2814
01:50:48,658 --> 01:50:52,679
with them where they said they don't

2815
01:50:50,039 --> 01:50:54,539
cure their flour before sale and when

2816
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:57,719
Ivan was pressed a little bit about why

2817
01:50:54,539 --> 01:50:59,939
that is he says oh you know it's because

2818
01:50:57,719 --> 01:51:01,560
um the Terps are like at their most

2819
01:50:59,939 --> 01:51:03,658
highest concentration and they're kind

2820
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:07,320
of most popping at that point so my

2821
01:51:03,658 --> 01:51:08,638
question is do you think that all weeds

2822
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:10,319
should be cured and do you kind of

2823
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,000
understand this underlying idea that

2824
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:13,799
he's presenting that like the most

2825
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,880
freshest the Cannabis is ever going to

2826
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,880
be is before a cure

2827
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:23,399
I mean I've seen some weed and I know

2828
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:25,860
like with like um some crazy narrow Leaf

2829
01:51:23,399 --> 01:51:27,479
stuff like that would never be anything

2830
01:51:25,859 --> 01:51:29,819
they'd be growing because it's not

2831
01:51:27,479 --> 01:51:31,919
practical and it's not so much what

2832
01:51:29,819 --> 01:51:33,299
people want you know

2833
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:36,420
um I think some of those things are

2834
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:38,159
better after they sit and cure but I

2835
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:39,800
think for people who just want really

2836
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:44,759
loud

2837
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:46,560
stinky weed with the most Terps and the

2838
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:48,060
brightest color and kind of what people

2839
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:51,239
want in the market

2840
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:54,360
I think people do want fresh weed you

2841
01:51:51,238 --> 01:51:57,178
know and I am of the opinion

2842
01:51:54,359 --> 01:51:58,380
that when your weed is when your weed is

2843
01:51:57,179 --> 01:52:03,179
dry

2844
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:06,659
like I don't put wheat away when

2845
01:52:03,179 --> 01:52:09,239
it's a little wet and burp it like to me

2846
01:52:06,658 --> 01:52:11,339
that always winds up fermenting the weed

2847
01:52:09,238 --> 01:52:14,000
and I've done it side by side lots of

2848
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:19,860
different ways on accident on purpose

2849
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:22,020
jars bags tubs whatever and to me you

2850
01:52:19,859 --> 01:52:24,420
dry the weed so that it takes a while to

2851
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:27,420
get dry and you keep it cool

2852
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:32,219
and when it gets done

2853
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:35,060
to me that's it it's there like you know

2854
01:52:32,219 --> 01:52:35,060
I I

2855
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:42,118
believe that the drying process is the

2856
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:44,639
cure and to me that takes between two

2857
01:52:42,118 --> 01:52:46,679
and three weeks ideally about three

2858
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:49,440
weeks to really be there

2859
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:52,560
and at that point it should be all the

2860
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:54,599
way dry and you put it away and I don't

2861
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,900
think it ever gets any better unless

2862
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:59,820
maybe it's like I said an odd odd type

2863
01:52:57,899 --> 01:53:03,359
you know but as far as if you're growing

2864
01:52:59,819 --> 01:53:06,238
like OG and cookies derivatives and all

2865
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:08,880
these things I think you know let it

2866
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,919
that it should be it should be hanging

2867
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,679
up until

2868
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:15,000
it is

2869
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:16,980
dry throughout

2870
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,658
and that at that point you should be

2871
01:53:16,979 --> 01:53:20,759
able to put it away and it should be

2872
01:53:18,658 --> 01:53:25,379
sticky and dank

2873
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:27,719
and the stems should be Snappy and dry

2874
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:31,380
the weed should be sticky

2875
01:53:27,719 --> 01:53:33,600
and it should be dry weed as dry as you

2876
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:38,279
want it and that's it and you seal it up

2877
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:40,380
and it's done you know and that's how

2878
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:42,840
um that's how it comes out best for me

2879
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:44,340
that's the way that it smells like what

2880
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:45,779
it's supposed to smell like and it

2881
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,619
tastes like what it's supposed to taste

2882
01:53:45,779 --> 01:53:53,219
like like that is its identity captured

2883
01:53:49,618 --> 01:53:55,319
like you wanted OG well smell this this

2884
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:57,539
is OG and you're like damn that's

2885
01:53:55,319 --> 01:53:59,460
[ __ ] good and if you put it away when

2886
01:53:57,539 --> 01:54:00,960
it's a little moist and you burp it and

2887
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:03,300
[ __ ] it'll just you're just gonna make

2888
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,439
it smell like dough you know it's just

2889
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:07,800
gonna get

2890
01:54:04,439 --> 01:54:10,319
um fermented and there's gonna be you

2891
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:12,420
know Funk and it's not you're gonna lose

2892
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:14,819
it's it's gonna lose its sharpness you

2893
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:17,460
know in my experience

2894
01:54:14,819 --> 01:54:19,380
so the reason why I asked that question

2895
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:20,939
actually is because I noticed while

2896
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:23,460
reading the sky kind of the cush

2897
01:54:20,939 --> 01:54:25,079
description you mentioned that it has a

2898
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:27,179
long shelf life and it kind of got me

2899
01:54:25,079 --> 01:54:28,559
thinking about the two polar ends of the

2900
01:54:27,179 --> 01:54:30,779
spectrum where you know you've got Ivan

2901
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:32,400
saying it's best at the start but then

2902
01:54:30,779 --> 01:54:34,800
you're kind of introducing this idea

2903
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:37,259
that these genetics are designed to kind

2904
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:39,659
of retain the Terps and it's gonna have

2905
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:42,179
a longer shelf life and a stability in

2906
01:54:39,658 --> 01:54:45,779
that regard do you think that's kind of

2907
01:54:42,179 --> 01:54:47,940
an accurate take on the situation and

2908
01:54:45,779 --> 01:54:50,279
um as like a bit of a follow-up do you

2909
01:54:47,939 --> 01:54:52,678
think that it might benefit shops or

2910
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:54,539
sellers to think about this and try to

2911
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:56,219
stock like one of each so they've got

2912
01:54:54,539 --> 01:54:58,019
like both the short and long term

2913
01:54:56,219 --> 01:55:01,500
covered

2914
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:04,080
yeah I mean there's certain things like

2915
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:06,658
um you know I say like the sky cuddler

2916
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:08,939

2917
01:55:06,658 --> 01:55:11,519
they have good shelf life because of the

2918
01:55:08,939 --> 01:55:15,000
type of resin that they have the resin

2919
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:17,940
stays in the resin like it is on the

2920
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:22,319
weed but it's where it is and it stays

2921
01:55:17,939 --> 01:55:24,899
there and it's solid and it's not greasy

2922
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:28,920
um something like cherry limeade when it

2923
01:55:24,899 --> 01:55:29,638
sits the resin is so

2924
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:33,779
um

2925
01:55:29,639 --> 01:55:36,239
oily and the resin heads have such a

2926
01:55:33,779 --> 01:55:37,019
thin membrane

2927
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:40,439
um

2928
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:43,980
that it actually the the weed itself

2929
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:47,939
will soak up the resin because it's it's

2930
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:49,319
it's wet it's not wet but the oil is

2931
01:55:47,939 --> 01:55:53,158
um

2932
01:55:49,319 --> 01:55:54,599
the oil is so thin and runny in a sense

2933
01:55:53,158 --> 01:55:57,238
you know what I mean

2934
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:59,460
that it wants to soak into the weed and

2935
01:55:57,238 --> 01:56:00,959
so it turns the weed dark it stays tasty

2936
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:03,420
it's not like there's anything wrong

2937
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,639
with it but it's like you look at cherry

2938
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:09,539
limeade fresh it's not every plant but

2939
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:11,579
most of them you look at it fresh and it

2940
01:56:09,539 --> 01:56:13,079
looks incredible and then you have it

2941
01:56:11,579 --> 01:56:15,359
for three or four weeks and you're like

2942
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:16,920
oh it looks really dark

2943
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:18,839
and

2944
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:20,940
and it almost looks like what other weed

2945
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:25,440
looks like if you were to go to [ __ ] up

2946
01:56:20,939 --> 01:56:27,839
and go oops I spilled some oil on it or

2947
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:30,960
um you know somebody was being a

2948
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:33,360
goofball and dipped it in [ __ ] uh you

2949
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,579
know like the first step of moon rocks

2950
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:38,339
or some [ __ ] it's just like it's greasy

2951
01:56:35,579 --> 01:56:40,260
and dark and if you're really

2952
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:42,179
um if you really know what's up with it

2953
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:44,639
then you just look at it and you go oh

2954
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:47,520
damn crazy you know like that's nice and

2955
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:49,260
you can appreciate it but people want a

2956
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:52,080
certain type of product presented to

2957
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:53,579
them when they buy a jar or a bag of

2958
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:55,979
weed

2959
01:56:53,579 --> 01:56:58,920
um and it doesn't really fit so for a

2960
01:56:55,979 --> 01:57:00,959
smoker if I give you some year old

2961
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:02,940
cherry limeade and it's all greased out

2962
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:04,260
you're like oh damn okay this is nice

2963
01:57:02,939 --> 01:57:07,259
and you roll it up and you're like [ __ ]

2964
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:10,380
how's that so tasty so technically it

2965
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:12,179
has a great shelf life too but the sky

2966
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:14,460
cuddler Kush

2967
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:16,199
you'll look at it when it's fresh and

2968
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:17,880
you'll look at it in a month and it'll

2969
01:57:16,198 --> 01:57:21,539
be the exact same weed

2970
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:23,639
but it's not that it gets better a month

2971
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:25,618
later it's just that it doesn't get

2972
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:27,179
worse looking so that's why I say it has

2973
01:57:25,618 --> 01:57:28,380
good shelf life it's not like it's

2974
01:57:27,179 --> 01:57:30,658
improving

2975
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:33,359
but it's not going down the tubes

2976
01:57:30,658 --> 01:57:35,339
visually now the cherry limeade isn't

2977
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:36,479
going down the tubes as far as what

2978
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:39,000
you're going to smoke you're going to

2979
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:40,678
smoke it and it's going to be dank but

2980
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,020
people are going to look at it and be

2981
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:44,340
like ah it's dark it's not shiny why

2982
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:46,739
does it look like that there's something

2983
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:48,900
wrong with it and you have to be

2984
01:57:46,738 --> 01:57:51,718
educated to know that oh that's because

2985
01:57:48,899 --> 01:57:54,539
it has it's approaching five and six

2986
01:57:51,719 --> 01:57:57,539
percent terpenes on it and the type of

2987
01:57:54,539 --> 01:57:59,880
terpenes it has are the type that want

2988
01:57:57,539 --> 01:58:04,198
to basically soak into anything it's

2989
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:08,279
next to and so it it breaks itself down

2990
01:58:04,198 --> 01:58:11,698
with with this very fine oil

2991
01:58:08,279 --> 01:58:13,979
um and it actually is is a sign of its

2992
01:58:11,698 --> 01:58:16,319
quality that it looks so terrible you

2993
01:58:13,979 --> 01:58:18,359
know but there's no way to explain that

2994
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:19,920
to somebody who just grabbed a jar and

2995
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:21,658
looks inside and goes what'd these guys

2996
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:24,539
sell me I don't want this anymore you

2997
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:26,579
know so

2998
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:28,738
um there's definitely a thing to shelf

2999
01:58:26,579 --> 01:58:30,899
life I think it's even discussed in

3000
01:58:28,738 --> 01:58:33,598
marijuana botany back in the 80s like

3001
01:58:30,899 --> 01:58:36,299
some weed lasts and looks pretty some

3002
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:39,599
doesn't some weed drops its resin easily

3003
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:41,520
so if you handle it a lot of the resin

3004
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:44,400
winds up at the bottom of the bag and it

3005
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:46,980
doesn't look as pretty and some holds on

3006
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:49,019
to its resin and like there's different

3007
01:58:46,979 --> 01:58:52,439
there's different

3008
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:54,179
um qualities to the way resin is on a

3009
01:58:52,439 --> 01:58:56,879
plant that make it good for some things

3010
01:58:54,179 --> 01:58:59,219
and not as good for others like cherry

3011
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,980
limeade the shelf life on it flavor-wise

3012
01:58:59,219 --> 01:59:04,739
is amazing but the color gets dark so if

3013
01:59:01,979 --> 01:59:06,899
you wanted to sell pre-rolls use you

3014
01:59:04,738 --> 01:59:08,819
sell pre-rolls of cherry limeade people

3015
01:59:06,899 --> 01:59:09,960
get a pre-roll and they get it goes

3016
01:59:08,819 --> 01:59:11,399
through the whole system and they get

3017
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:13,500
away later and they smoke it they're

3018
01:59:11,399 --> 01:59:15,598
like damn this is still really bomb

3019
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:18,960
whereas some of the stuff that might

3020
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:20,699
look pretty at that point it doesn't it

3021
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:22,500
hasn't maintained its Funk like

3022
01:59:20,698 --> 01:59:25,738
something with so much terpenes what

3023
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:27,238
like the cherry limeade so you have to

3024
01:59:25,738 --> 01:59:29,698
kind of know what product you're trying

3025
01:59:27,238 --> 01:59:32,279
to make and then you have to make you

3026
01:59:29,698 --> 01:59:35,279
know you want to make tomato sauce you

3027
01:59:32,279 --> 01:59:38,279
use a sauce tomato you know you wanna

3028
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:40,079
you wanna ship Tomatoes you use the the

3029
01:59:38,279 --> 01:59:42,840
one that's going to ship the best

3030
01:59:40,079 --> 01:59:45,059
you want to use do you want to make like

3031
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:46,860
ketchup you want a sweeter tomato or

3032
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:48,480
whatever it is you know you don't want

3033
01:59:46,859 --> 01:59:50,639
to use a

3034
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:53,098
you don't want to use a Carolina Reaper

3035
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:54,840
to make pico de gallo to [ __ ] sell to

3036
01:59:53,099 --> 01:59:56,579
everybody like you're gonna have to tell

3037
01:59:54,840 --> 02:00:00,119
people what that is and people have to

3038
01:59:56,579 --> 02:00:02,099
know what that is you know so like

3039
02:00:00,118 --> 02:00:04,079
everything's got its place but what

3040
02:00:02,099 --> 02:00:07,079
people want right now in a lot of cases

3041
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:09,420
is what pleases the most people and

3042
02:00:07,079 --> 02:00:11,279
needs the least explanation you look in

3043
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:13,859
there you go whoa that's some [ __ ] boom

3044
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:16,259
you got it and that's why there's such a

3045
02:00:13,859 --> 02:00:19,079
popularity with cookie derivatives and

3046
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:21,060
things that are you know have OG in them

3047
02:00:19,079 --> 02:00:23,579
or whatever because you just take a look

3048
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:26,940
and you go huh this seems like it's

3049
02:00:23,579 --> 02:00:28,559
pretty crazy this is not you know this

3050
02:00:26,939 --> 02:00:30,238
isn't the weed at home you know this is

3051
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,219
something that and that's why they call

3052
02:00:30,238 --> 02:00:34,618
it exotic because it looks like

3053
02:00:32,219 --> 02:00:36,239
something crazy and people people laugh

3054
02:00:34,618 --> 02:00:38,279
at that because they're like well it's

3055
02:00:36,238 --> 02:00:42,539
common so it's not exotic but it's still

3056
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:44,880
you know it's still the look of um

3057
02:00:42,539 --> 02:00:47,819
of what people kind of as that knee-jerk

3058
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:49,500
reaction and it's a crowd pleaser all

3059
02:00:47,819 --> 02:00:50,399
those kind of looks

3060
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:52,500
um

3061
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:55,138
so you know people buy something they

3062
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:57,238
want a lot of resin

3063
02:00:55,139 --> 02:00:59,159
um it's nice if it has if it has a look

3064
02:00:57,238 --> 02:01:02,399
to it where you go oh that's pretty it's

3065
02:00:59,158 --> 02:01:04,079
not just plain you know purple weed the

3066
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:05,819
first time someone sees purple weed I

3067
02:01:04,079 --> 02:01:07,618
guarantee every time they go whoa what's

3068
02:01:05,819 --> 02:01:10,198
up with that is that real it's like yeah

3069
02:01:07,618 --> 02:01:13,738
it grows like that what does it do they

3070
02:01:10,198 --> 02:01:16,799
dye it is it watered with dye is it you

3071
02:01:13,738 --> 02:01:18,658
know it's it's not real right and like

3072
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,920
you know then people have seen purple

3073
02:01:18,658 --> 02:01:21,839
weed for a while they're like oh

3074
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:25,079
whatever it's purple who cares you know

3075
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:27,560
but it's it's uh you know the market is

3076
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:29,880
is selling to people who are um

3077
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:31,619
impressed at certain things so I think

3078
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:34,560
like uh

3079
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:37,139
you know shelf life is good uh in

3080
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:38,639
certain ways for certain things you know

3081
02:01:37,139 --> 02:01:40,560
and then there's other types of shelf

3082
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:42,118
life and then but like you know

3083
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,280
something like I was talking about was

3084
02:01:42,118 --> 02:01:45,598
just like you look at it in a jar and

3085
02:01:44,279 --> 02:01:47,819
it's a few months old and you're like

3086
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:49,980
boom this is nice good fresh weed so it

3087
02:01:47,819 --> 02:01:51,019
sits and it lasts you know

3088
02:01:49,979 --> 02:01:54,359
um

3089
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:55,860
but you know it doesn't have to sit to

3090
02:01:54,359 --> 02:01:57,539
get good and it doesn't have to be

3091
02:01:55,859 --> 02:01:59,698
totally fresh to be good and that's

3092
02:01:57,539 --> 02:02:01,679
that's what's good I mean any any any

3093
02:01:59,698 --> 02:02:03,899
kind of agricultural thing you really

3094
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,819
want the shelf life you know you want an

3095
02:02:03,899 --> 02:02:07,679
apple you can ship you want a tomato you

3096
02:02:05,819 --> 02:02:11,279
can ship you don't want it to go bad in

3097
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:14,099
two days but in you know like with like

3098
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:15,899
heirloom tomatoes the best ones they get

3099
02:02:14,099 --> 02:02:17,819
really juicy and if you stack them up

3100
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:20,339
they'll squash each other and they're

3101
02:02:17,819 --> 02:02:22,259
you know to the best strawberries have

3102
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:23,520
too much sugar they'll they'll rot

3103
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:25,380
really fast you have to pick them and

3104
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:26,820
eat them right away and that's like

3105
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:29,880
something like cherry limeade it's

3106
02:02:26,819 --> 02:02:32,759
killer but it's not really fit for being

3107
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:35,099
packaged up and um you know so there's

3108
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:36,900
that there's that thing there where a

3109
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:39,480
fruit or a vegetable has to be able to

3110
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:41,519
ship it has to be able to sit it has to

3111
02:02:39,479 --> 02:02:43,439
be able to look good to the most people

3112
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:46,619
even if the people who know the most

3113
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:48,539
might think it doesn't look the best

3114
02:02:46,618 --> 02:02:49,979
um you know that's with Mark with

3115
02:02:48,539 --> 02:02:51,779
marketing things that's what people are

3116
02:02:49,979 --> 02:02:53,218
trying to hit they're going you know

3117
02:02:51,779 --> 02:02:55,439
they want to they want to have the most

3118
02:02:53,219 --> 02:02:57,060
sales to the most people the most often

3119
02:02:55,439 --> 02:02:59,698
and they want to have the most returned

3120
02:02:57,060 --> 02:03:01,500
customers and um you know you try

3121
02:02:59,698 --> 02:03:03,658
different things and certain things work

3122
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:05,939
and it might not

3123
02:03:03,658 --> 02:03:08,460
you know they might not be the best to

3124
02:03:05,939 --> 02:03:10,500
certain people but if they average out

3125
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:12,060
at being the best to the most people

3126
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:13,979
then there's your product you know

3127
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:16,860
that's what a hit record is that's what

3128
02:03:13,979 --> 02:03:18,539
a hit pair of shoes is that's what you

3129
02:03:16,859 --> 02:03:21,059
know whatever whatever it is those are

3130
02:03:18,539 --> 02:03:23,099
the things that catch on and get uh you

3131
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:25,080
know get some steam

3132
02:03:23,099 --> 02:03:27,360
yeah wow there's certainly a lot more

3133
02:03:25,079 --> 02:03:29,579
complexities than what might seem

3134
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:33,420
apparent on the surface isn't there

3135
02:03:29,579 --> 02:03:35,760
speaking of uh loud Terps I've been

3136
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:37,380
wanting to follow up with you about one

3137
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:40,679
of the favorite things I tried from you

3138
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:43,319
the male emsky project have you figured

3139
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:44,880
out what is your favorite pairing with

3140
02:03:43,319 --> 02:03:48,059
this one for the listeners who aren't

3141
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:50,940
aware this is a a cut that Gene has

3142
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:53,099
that's like Tangy on steroids and also

3143
02:03:50,939 --> 02:03:55,439
roid raging and also even then way

3144
02:03:53,099 --> 02:03:57,900
better and different to that

3145
02:03:55,439 --> 02:03:59,638
yeah so it's actually a seed line which

3146
02:03:57,899 --> 02:04:02,279
is cool because it's totally every every

3147
02:03:59,639 --> 02:04:04,440
plant has the same has the same turps

3148
02:04:02,279 --> 02:04:06,599
and there's a slight variation some are

3149
02:04:04,439 --> 02:04:09,899
a little better smelling than others

3150
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:11,880
but um my buddy Jim had it and he had

3151
02:04:09,899 --> 02:04:13,920
been calling it lemon kush and I told

3152
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:15,179
him hey there's already a lemon kush and

3153
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:17,579
he goes well I used to call it Green

3154
02:04:15,179 --> 02:04:19,980
Lantern but then I heard these gangster

3155
02:04:17,579 --> 02:04:22,439
rappers rapping about Green Lantern and

3156
02:04:19,979 --> 02:04:24,118
then so then I changed it from that and

3157
02:04:22,439 --> 02:04:25,678
so I changed it to Lemon Kush and I go

3158
02:04:24,118 --> 02:04:29,098
well there's a lemon kush too you know

3159
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:30,480
and he's like oh [ __ ] okay well and I go

3160
02:04:29,099 --> 02:04:31,920
you know it's not so much that you don't

3161
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:33,658
want to use the same name but I go

3162
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:36,539
there's people who think of it as like

3163
02:04:33,658 --> 02:04:39,179
being like a a train wrecky kind of a

3164
02:04:36,539 --> 02:04:41,340
thing you know that people uh when they

3165
02:04:39,179 --> 02:04:43,800
hear lemon you know like it's like a a

3166
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:45,599
different thing and he's like oh okay

3167
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:48,539
well you know I don't know whatever and

3168
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:50,579
he didn't really care and and uh I was

3169
02:04:48,539 --> 02:04:52,439
like I was like [ __ ] it smells like

3170
02:04:50,579 --> 02:04:55,198
Meyer lemons you know like it's like

3171
02:04:52,439 --> 02:04:56,939
lemon but it's really sharp and then it

3172
02:04:55,198 --> 02:04:58,979
actually when it finished it developed

3173
02:04:56,939 --> 02:05:00,719
this passion fruit grapefruit thing you

3174
02:04:58,979 --> 02:05:03,118
know but I was like oh I'm gonna call it

3175
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:06,239
Meyer Lems Meyer lemsky like Meyer

3176
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:08,939
Lansky and Meyer lemons you know and um

3177
02:05:06,238 --> 02:05:10,979
and uh you know so I called it that for

3178
02:05:08,939 --> 02:05:12,539
when I when I worked it for myself I

3179
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:14,759
haven't done anything with it but I told

3180
02:05:12,539 --> 02:05:16,859
him I'm like hey I gave it this handle

3181
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:18,420
and he was like oh cool right on you

3182
02:05:16,859 --> 02:05:20,339
know and he didn't really care he's just

3183
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:22,920
it's his old stuff so what it is is it's

3184
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:26,219
old he had this old uh Santa Barbara

3185
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:27,960
gold from from the 70s

3186
02:05:26,219 --> 02:05:30,000
and then

3187
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:32,639
somebody passed him a joint and it was

3188
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,960
this killer uh it was this killer weed

3189
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:35,760
and he's like damn that's the tastiest

3190
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:37,560
joint ever and he was like what's that

3191
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,320
and they're all it's called indica and

3192
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:42,679
he's all Indica huh so this was like 83

3193
02:05:40,319 --> 02:05:46,319
or 82 or I don't know sometime back then

3194
02:05:42,679 --> 02:05:48,359
and it was uh it was like you know an

3195
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,399
Afghani or Pakistani and it was just

3196
02:05:48,359 --> 02:05:52,139
like that really good nice

3197
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:54,179
um you know those best ones that are

3198
02:05:52,139 --> 02:05:56,699
like Hindu you know the really tasty

3199
02:05:54,179 --> 02:05:58,739
deep rich flavor like what I call big

3200
02:05:56,698 --> 02:06:00,960
blue or kind of like what the black Affy

3201
02:05:58,738 --> 02:06:03,118
is and

3202
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,279
um you know from his description and he

3203
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:07,139
and he was like yeah it's that's killer

3204
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:08,698
and the guy was like the guy was like oh

3205
02:06:07,139 --> 02:06:10,500
cool you like it here and he had like

3206
02:06:08,698 --> 02:06:12,000
two or three seats from Rolling The

3207
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:13,439
Joint he gave him to him and so he

3208
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,960
planted them and he crossed them and

3209
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:18,539
then he said like late 80s he got the

3210
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:20,520
stuff that they called the red vein

3211
02:06:18,539 --> 02:06:22,439
which I think

3212
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:25,020
based on the neighborhood he was out of

3213
02:06:22,439 --> 02:06:28,319
that it probably is is related to what

3214
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:30,480
we call the perp which is in the black

3215
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:34,799
lime and the Pina

3216
02:06:30,479 --> 02:06:35,459
and um has the reddish purple stems and

3217
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:37,679
um

3218
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:39,719
but I'm not positive in that but it

3219
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:41,579
makes sense and so he said he crossed

3220
02:06:39,719 --> 02:06:43,260
those together and then he just started

3221
02:06:41,579 --> 02:06:46,618
breeding him every year

3222
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:48,239
so they don't have the red the red veins

3223
02:06:46,618 --> 02:06:50,639
anymore

3224
02:06:48,238 --> 02:06:52,319
um they don't have the Colombian

3225
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:54,840
stretch they're these squat little

3226
02:06:52,319 --> 02:06:56,639
Indica plants they don't produce quite

3227
02:06:54,840 --> 02:07:00,539
as much resin as you want them to have

3228
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:03,359
but the terpene levels are insane and it

3229
02:07:00,539 --> 02:07:06,060
smells like Meyer lemon grapefruit

3230
02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:07,859
passion fruit which is like my very

3231
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:10,139
favorite Tangy throws that are really

3232
02:07:07,859 --> 02:07:11,519
rare and pop out like in the sour Tangy

3233
02:07:10,139 --> 02:07:14,219
too

3234
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:17,219
um but instead of it being like this

3235
02:07:14,219 --> 02:07:19,319
rare thing and being mixed in with like

3236
02:07:17,219 --> 02:07:21,480
you know like kind of like train wreck

3237
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:24,179
Terps and stuff like how Tangi seed is

3238
02:07:21,479 --> 02:07:25,799
it's just all of that and then every

3239
02:07:24,179 --> 02:07:27,480
once in a while one's a little toned

3240
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,679
down or one has like a hint of some

3241
02:07:27,479 --> 02:07:31,439
other kind of like

3242
02:07:28,679 --> 02:07:33,960
sweet banana or whatever kind of thing

3243
02:07:31,439 --> 02:07:36,500
in it but pretty much they all do that

3244
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:40,020
and when you cross it with anything

3245
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:42,960
turns into that terp like it bullied the

3246
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:45,119
hell out of GMO and turned it into

3247
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:48,179
purple Mario lemsky with tons of resin

3248
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:50,460
so that one's promising

3249
02:07:48,179 --> 02:07:52,618
um and then there's some other ones too

3250
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:54,599
and skunk Tech was the one that made the

3251
02:07:52,618 --> 02:07:57,359
outcross As I crossed it with lime I

3252
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:59,460
haven't grown them yet and I made a ton

3253
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:00,960
of the pure seed because as soon as I

3254
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:02,819
planted them I looked at the seedlings

3255
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:05,340
and I was like these are killer right

3256
02:08:02,819 --> 02:08:07,920
here and by the time I found out the

3257
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:09,060
back story on them

3258
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:11,099
um

3259
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:12,780
I already had plants that were like

3260
02:08:11,099 --> 02:08:14,400
butted out and I was smelling them and I

3261
02:08:12,779 --> 02:08:16,500
was like what the hell are these and

3262
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:17,819
then I I got them from from Jim's

3263
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:20,219
daughter and then

3264
02:08:17,819 --> 02:08:22,259
um in a little trade with them and then

3265
02:08:20,219 --> 02:08:24,000
I saw him and I go what is the story

3266
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:27,239
dude and that was when he told me what

3267
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,380
they were and uh so it's just a really

3268
02:08:27,238 --> 02:08:32,098
neat

3269
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:33,618
um Pure Line from the 80s of all old 70s

3270
02:08:32,099 --> 02:08:37,860
and 80s stuff

3271
02:08:33,618 --> 02:08:40,319
and uh it's one of those things where if

3272
02:08:37,859 --> 02:08:42,238
it was put out pure people would be like

3273
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:45,059
nah this is they don't want this this

3274
02:08:42,238 --> 02:08:48,718
doesn't have enough resin although

3275
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:50,880
uh if you make oil off of it is insane

3276
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:53,579
and it tastes really good too it just

3277
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:57,060
doesn't look it's like

3278
02:08:53,579 --> 02:09:01,139
how skittles looks like it's not that

3279
02:08:57,060 --> 02:09:03,840
good but then it's tasty it's like that

3280
02:09:01,139 --> 02:09:07,920
except the oil is like

3281
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:10,819
tasty as tasty or tastier than Skittles

3282
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:14,099
but the weed is like

3283
02:09:10,819 --> 02:09:15,840
worse looking so it's a little Greener

3284
02:09:14,099 --> 02:09:17,579
it's a little more bright but it just it

3285
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:19,440
doesn't look like there's a lot of resin

3286
02:09:17,579 --> 02:09:21,059
on it but what's cool is you take that

3287
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:23,698
and you cross it with anything that's

3288
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:26,099
super resinous and it just comes across

3289
02:09:23,698 --> 02:09:28,079
in every plant on the Terps So

3290
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:30,599
eventually I'll probably do

3291
02:09:28,079 --> 02:09:32,039
um something with it but

3292
02:09:30,599 --> 02:09:33,599
um at this point we haven't done

3293
02:09:32,039 --> 02:09:36,599
anything with any of the crosses because

3294
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:38,099
we didn't want to step on toes and uh I

3295
02:09:36,599 --> 02:09:41,099
had talked to them about you know if I

3296
02:09:38,099 --> 02:09:43,020
ever do anything like is it cool and you

3297
02:09:41,099 --> 02:09:44,639
know what will we can do some kind of

3298
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:46,320
split on it because it's your old

3299
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:50,340
genetics and stuff and he was totally

3300
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:52,679
down but um I just haven't ever put any

3301
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:54,779
more focus into it I have thousands of

3302
02:09:52,679 --> 02:09:57,179
the of the pure seeds I made I think I

3303
02:09:54,779 --> 02:10:00,000
did like six different plants and they

3304
02:09:57,179 --> 02:10:03,359
were all killer but I have like the the

3305
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:06,420
best three put aside

3306
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:08,098
oh nice but look I'm sure when the

3307
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:10,679
time's right you'll uh you'll do

3308
02:10:08,099 --> 02:10:15,300
something special with them when I was

3309
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:17,699
looking at some of your other strains it

3310
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:20,579
made me realize that many of your lines

3311
02:10:17,698 --> 02:10:23,039
we see a lot of resistance to mold and

3312
02:10:20,579 --> 02:10:24,719
to rot and to drought and I think that's

3313
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:26,279
obviously because for the longest time

3314
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:28,198
you're growing outdoors and those were

3315
02:10:26,279 --> 02:10:30,599
obviously like really important factors

3316
02:10:28,198 --> 02:10:32,460
but kind of if we think about the

3317
02:10:30,599 --> 02:10:34,800
producers we were talking about a few

3318
02:10:32,460 --> 02:10:37,618
questions back do you think that some of

3319
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:41,099
these traits might ever start to become

3320
02:10:37,618 --> 02:10:43,439
more seen or try to be expressed by

3321
02:10:41,099 --> 02:10:45,239
these companies because there are so

3322
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:47,638
many companies moving into Greenhouse

3323
02:10:45,238 --> 02:10:49,919
cultivation and like many of these

3324
02:10:47,639 --> 02:10:52,020
problems like mold rot

3325
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,679
um are just some of the biggest issues

3326
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:56,880
these larger producers face

3327
02:10:54,679 --> 02:10:59,460
yeah I think there's a I think there's

3328
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:01,560
quite a bit of focus on it already

3329
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:02,880
um depending on who the who the people

3330
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:04,560
are

3331
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:06,179
um people who have dealt with those

3332
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:08,580
issues are the people who are more

3333
02:11:06,179 --> 02:11:10,859
likely to kind of steer in those

3334
02:11:08,579 --> 02:11:12,000
directions

3335
02:11:10,859 --> 02:11:16,079
um

3336
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,939
so you know I think right now it I think

3337
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:20,158
there's a lot of stuff going on that

3338
02:11:17,939 --> 02:11:21,359
hasn't really been seen yet I think

3339
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:24,299
right now there's probably already

3340
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:26,339
people in Labs finding all the markers

3341
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:28,860
for all these desirable things and

3342
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:30,659
making it so that you could basically

3343
02:11:28,859 --> 02:11:32,339
send them samples of your plants and

3344
02:11:30,658 --> 02:11:35,399
they'd say hey here's your mail that

3345
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:38,159
won't that will breed for no mold for no

3346
02:11:35,399 --> 02:11:40,138
mildew for this past resistance or

3347
02:11:38,158 --> 02:11:42,420
whatever it is I think it's already

3348
02:11:40,139 --> 02:11:44,279
being done and it's just not really

3349
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:45,000
quite

3350
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:47,460
um

3351
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,960
it hasn't the wave hasn't quite hit but

3352
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:51,000
I think it's already sitting out there

3353
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:53,039
you know what I mean I think it's

3354
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,198
already uh I think it's already a thing

3355
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:58,139
for sure I think it just there's people

3356
02:11:55,198 --> 02:12:01,259
who have already

3357
02:11:58,139 --> 02:12:04,260
done it out of necessity and

3358
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:07,560
um and I'm not the only one you know uh

3359
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:09,840
biovortex green Source Spartans I think

3360
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:13,320
they're called uh

3361
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,400
uh uh homegrown natural wonders Odie and

3362
02:12:13,319 --> 02:12:15,899
mush

3363
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:18,420
um

3364
02:12:15,899 --> 02:12:19,738
you know there's they're they're out

3365
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:21,960
there there's people there's people

3366
02:12:19,738 --> 02:12:24,539
doing it you know

3367
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:26,399
um and then I but but I think that also

3368
02:12:24,539 --> 02:12:28,019
there's people involved in big AG who

3369
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:29,638
who are doing the same thing behind the

3370
02:12:28,020 --> 02:12:31,860
scenes and that'll be

3371
02:12:29,639 --> 02:12:33,900
that'll be the new I think in a year or

3372
02:12:31,859 --> 02:12:36,839
two that'll be the Big Marketing push oh

3373
02:12:33,899 --> 02:12:39,539
buy our pounds of hemp seed because it's

3374
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:42,119
you know it will get zero mold you know

3375
02:12:39,539 --> 02:12:44,698
they'll figure out

3376
02:12:42,118 --> 02:12:47,339
um things that offer resistance and and

3377
02:12:44,698 --> 02:12:49,019
see what really really does that you

3378
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:51,659
know

3379
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:54,239
yeah sure

3380
02:12:51,658 --> 02:12:56,578
so earlier on in the episode we spoke

3381
02:12:54,238 --> 02:12:58,859
about the emerald Cup and the ego Clash

3382
02:12:56,578 --> 02:13:00,658
there's been a lot of sort of mixed

3383
02:12:58,859 --> 02:13:02,759
thoughts about some of the bigger events

3384
02:13:00,658 --> 02:13:04,198
recently particularly as they sort of

3385
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:06,239
Rebrand themselves especially the

3386
02:13:04,198 --> 02:13:09,059
emerald cup is sort of a more casual

3387
02:13:06,238 --> 02:13:11,039
smoker event it's not as catering as

3388
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:13,560
much to the hardcore Growers especially

3389
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:15,179
not the Breeders and the sellers do you

3390
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:16,500
see yourself continuing to go to these

3391
02:13:15,179 --> 02:13:19,319
events or do you think the smaller ones

3392
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:23,539
like the ego Clash are gonna bloom more

3393
02:13:19,319 --> 02:13:23,539
and become the Mainstay of the industry

3394
02:13:23,639 --> 02:13:29,219
um you know

3395
02:13:25,319 --> 02:13:32,039
I kind of like the I like the aspect of

3396
02:13:29,219 --> 02:13:34,319
of the of the big shows just because

3397
02:13:32,039 --> 02:13:38,698
they

3398
02:13:34,319 --> 02:13:39,979
they put the most people in in one place

3399
02:13:38,698 --> 02:13:44,578
um

3400
02:13:39,979 --> 02:13:46,799
so it's like a super cool uh it's a cool

3401
02:13:44,578 --> 02:13:48,539
opportunity to

3402
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:51,360
meet the people who you might not meet

3403
02:13:48,539 --> 02:13:54,599
at the smaller ones I think probably the

3404
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:59,158
most really the the the most uh kind of

3405
02:13:54,599 --> 02:14:01,860
renowned official real head event is the

3406
02:13:59,158 --> 02:14:03,598
ego Clash that b puts on

3407
02:14:01,859 --> 02:14:06,118
um because he's the most like

3408
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:06,980
connoisseur minded he's you know kind of

3409
02:14:06,118 --> 02:14:11,279
has

3410
02:14:06,979 --> 02:14:17,399
uh he he he has a really good uh feel

3411
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:19,380
for Terps and quality and um and has

3412
02:14:17,399 --> 02:14:23,399
that Focus he's one of the one of the

3413
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:26,400
best at that and recognizes that in

3414
02:14:23,399 --> 02:14:29,158
other people and and and reaches out to

3415
02:14:26,399 --> 02:14:31,379
the right people to where if you win

3416
02:14:29,158 --> 02:14:33,299
that to me that's the one that's like

3417
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:35,520
damn okay

3418
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:37,980
um you you really had some [ __ ] because

3419
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:41,760
it's blind and it's the same people who

3420
02:14:37,979 --> 02:14:46,138
enter who are judging and it's kind of

3421
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:48,719
uh more of an invitation only

3422
02:14:46,139 --> 02:14:51,118
um and so I think you know that that

3423
02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:53,939
that's the more like the serious one but

3424
02:14:51,118 --> 02:14:57,420
there's you know an event isn't only

3425
02:14:53,939 --> 02:15:00,299
about the contest and how official it is

3426
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:02,399
an event is also about a social space

3427
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:06,840
and

3428
02:15:02,399 --> 02:15:09,539
um a gathering of people and

3429
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:11,460
um you know when it's opened up to so

3430
02:15:09,539 --> 02:15:12,840
many people from everywhere and it's

3431
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:15,060
just whoever

3432
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:17,520
you know there's an aspect there that's

3433
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:19,920
kind of cool and um so you know I

3434
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:22,739
support both both sides and I think they

3435
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:24,779
both have their own uh they both have

3436
02:15:22,738 --> 02:15:27,479
their own thing going to them you know

3437
02:15:24,779 --> 02:15:29,819
going for them and I think uh you know I

3438
02:15:27,479 --> 02:15:33,118
think they both deserve their their

3439
02:15:29,819 --> 02:15:34,859
respect in their in their own space and

3440
02:15:33,118 --> 02:15:35,578
that

3441
02:15:34,859 --> 02:15:38,698
um

3442
02:15:35,578 --> 02:15:41,399
what the emerald cup was for a while is

3443
02:15:38,698 --> 02:15:43,638
kind of now what the ego Clash is where

3444
02:15:41,399 --> 02:15:46,500
it's like okay that's the most

3445
02:15:43,639 --> 02:15:49,020
uh probably respectable a word you can

3446
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:51,479
get but I think that the emerald cup is

3447
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:53,880
still is still a respectable award as

3448
02:15:51,479 --> 02:15:56,158
well at this point to get you know and

3449
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:58,920
that they're kind of the the two the two

3450
02:15:56,158 --> 02:16:01,319
the two main things you know

3451
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:04,020
we're very diplomatic I like that

3452
02:16:01,319 --> 02:16:05,639
so just a few more questions as we're on

3453
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:08,040
the tail end of things before the Fast

3454
02:16:05,639 --> 02:16:09,900
Five I remember I asked you this in our

3455
02:16:08,039 --> 02:16:11,698
first interview so I'd love to see how

3456
02:16:09,899 --> 02:16:14,460
things have changed are there any

3457
02:16:11,698 --> 02:16:16,319
breeders work that's caught your eye and

3458
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:17,460
you're kind of enjoying the work they're

3459
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:19,559
doing

3460
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:21,118
oh like I was saying I like souvenir

3461
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:23,940
seeds

3462
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:26,098
um pip he does great stuff I don't even

3463
02:16:23,939 --> 02:16:28,678
have to get into it it's just real nice

3464
02:16:26,099 --> 02:16:30,179
people can look them up

3465
02:16:28,679 --> 02:16:33,540
um

3466
02:16:30,179 --> 02:16:35,819
oh man this is the one where it's always

3467
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:38,519
like I know guaranteed there's gonna be

3468
02:16:35,819 --> 02:16:39,599
uh there's gonna be a lot of people that

3469
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:43,260
I don't

3470
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:46,260
that I don't name him I say is cool just

3471
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:47,059
because he's bringing out old stuff

3472
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:49,859
um

3473
02:16:47,058 --> 02:16:52,199

real Sour his stuff is real he's got the

3475
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:56,399
real cool sour

3476
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:58,439
um everybody else I mean I think I've

3477
02:16:56,398 --> 02:16:59,939
probably mostly given shouts to

3478
02:16:58,439 --> 02:17:02,519
everybody who's

3479
02:16:59,939 --> 02:17:05,639
who I can really think of

3480
02:17:02,519 --> 02:17:07,800
um doing a lot of stuff uh my buddy

3481
02:17:05,638 --> 02:17:09,179
Dutch at regenerative is cool he's been

3482
02:17:07,799 --> 02:17:10,500
going through some stuff with crazy

3483
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:12,540
pressure

3484
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:15,000
uh and like the bad weather in

3485
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:17,460
Washington and pulling stuff out of out

3486
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,620
of my Gene pools I've worked with and

3487
02:17:17,459 --> 02:17:22,500
kind of you know Finding what is really

3488
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:24,240
really can take the bad elements and

3489
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:25,760
stuff there

3490
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:29,179
um

3491
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:29,179
he uh

3492
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:34,019

3493
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:36,540
just like pops out as being new like

3494

pick was kind of somebody I didn't know

3495
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:40,859
a year or two ago I think about their

3496
02:17:39,299 --> 02:17:43,739
work and they didn't I don't think he

3497
02:17:40,859 --> 02:17:44,819
had dropped stuff really

3498
02:17:43,739 --> 02:17:46,920
um

3499
02:17:44,819 --> 02:17:49,319
and I don't know you know just everybody

3500
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:51,179
who's everybody who's doing stuff that

3501
02:17:49,319 --> 02:17:53,459
they're that they're interested in and

3502
02:17:51,179 --> 02:17:55,920
going with their flavors and

3503
02:17:53,459 --> 02:17:57,178
all that you know

3504
02:17:55,920 --> 02:18:00,058
um

3505
02:17:57,179 --> 02:18:02,159
yeah I don't you know I don't besides

3506
02:18:00,058 --> 02:18:02,819
what I've already who I always say you

3507
02:18:02,159 --> 02:18:04,739

3508
02:18:02,819 --> 02:18:06,478
always uh

3509
02:18:04,739 --> 02:18:11,039
I always like to watch like you know

3510
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:13,319
what CSI is doing 707 seed bank

3511
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:15,000
but there's tons of them man there's

3512
02:18:13,319 --> 02:18:17,579
tons of people doing really cool stuff

3513
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:21,120
all the time so

3514
02:18:17,579 --> 02:18:24,000
yeah uh you know uh J trees and skunk

3515
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:26,460
attack have been doing really neat stuff

3516
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:30,420
um yeah

3517
02:18:26,459 --> 02:18:32,279
yeah some solid answers there for sure I

3518
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:34,019
um I definitely agree I've been

3519
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:36,719
following both of those guys doing some

3520
02:18:34,019 --> 02:18:39,300
some really good work uh so the next

3521
02:18:36,718 --> 02:18:42,239
question I had for you was what's the

3522
02:18:39,299 --> 02:18:44,279
most unique tur profile you've ever come

3523
02:18:42,239 --> 02:18:45,780
across and do you still see it around or

3524
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:49,439
is it gone

3525
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:51,620
most unique terp profile

3526
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:51,620
um

3527
02:18:51,739 --> 02:18:55,218
straight opium

3528
02:18:55,319 --> 02:19:01,619
um straight opium which is similar to

3529
02:18:57,659 --> 02:19:03,780
like a Sharpie or a flea collar or

3530
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:06,000
um there's a certain smell that that

3531
02:19:03,780 --> 02:19:08,340
straight opium has it's the one thing I

3532
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,079
saw in the 90s that I really wish I

3533
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:11,760
could find again

3534
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:15,959
um it's a certain smell and taste that's

3535
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:18,000
just incredible and uh that would be the

3536
02:19:15,959 --> 02:19:19,619
most rare that was really a standout

3537
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,659
because everything else is like there's

3538
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:23,219
like things close to it that's

3539
02:19:21,659 --> 02:19:26,299
completely unique and I've never seen

3540
02:19:23,218 --> 02:19:26,299
anything like it since

3541
02:19:26,579 --> 02:19:31,138
what a great answer I I can't say I'm

3542
02:19:29,218 --> 02:19:33,779
familiar so hopefully you're able to

3543
02:19:31,138 --> 02:19:35,879
find that one and it is still around

3544
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:38,880
kind of on a bit of a different topic I

3545
02:19:35,879 --> 02:19:41,398
did want to ask you we heard some word

3546
02:19:38,879 --> 02:19:43,858
recently from none other than Chimera

3547
02:19:41,398 --> 02:19:45,358
that Tom Hillard passed away and then it

3548
02:19:43,859 --> 02:19:47,880
turned out that that was like a bit of a

3549
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:49,859
fake report did you hear from Tom

3550
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:51,239
himself or Through the Grapevine sort of

3551
02:19:49,859 --> 02:19:53,760
thing and you know what he's up to or if

3552
02:19:51,239 --> 02:19:57,420
we'll ever see his seeds come back

3553
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:59,159
um I don't think he's too into it really

3554
02:19:57,420 --> 02:20:00,840
um I think he does stuff for himself and

3555
02:19:59,159 --> 02:20:03,180
he's kind of good with that

3556

are close to him it's true and blah blah

3566
02:20:21,540 --> 02:20:26,700
blah so I'm like [ __ ] okay so normally

3567
02:20:25,139 --> 02:20:28,920
if something like that happened and I

3568
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:31,500
had just got like a little word of it I

3569
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:33,299
would I would hit somebody up if it's

02:20:38,939 --> 02:20:42,960
and it always feels kind of weird so

3574
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:44,520

explained like this dude Chimera he's a

3619
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:17,640
big seed dude he he told people on the

3620
02:22:15,659 --> 02:22:20,159
forums and said it was totally for real

3621
02:22:17,639 --> 02:22:23,459
and he had heard direct from from from

3622
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:26,520
people who knew and this and that

3623
02:22:23,459 --> 02:22:28,619
and uh I'm like [ __ ] okay

3624
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:30,720
so that was that was how that played out

3625
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:32,939
and then I ran into him I ran into my

3626
02:22:30,719 --> 02:22:34,500
friend you know like uh down on the

3627
02:22:32,939 --> 02:22:36,420
street in Ukiah I didn't even want to

3628
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:38,818
mention it I just was like hey how's it

3629
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:40,559
going you know like I was still like

3630
02:22:38,818 --> 02:22:42,898
embarrassed really you know because I'm

3631
02:22:40,559 --> 02:22:45,239
like dude what a what a [ __ ] thing

3632
02:22:42,898 --> 02:22:46,858
to do but it was but but at the time of

3633
02:22:45,239 --> 02:22:49,799
course my intention was just to like

3634
02:22:46,859 --> 02:22:52,920
reach out and be like hey you know like

3635
02:22:49,799 --> 02:22:55,559
it you know just offer help and [ __ ] but

3636
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:58,318
so I was like my heart was in the right

3637
02:22:55,559 --> 02:23:00,359
place but my brain was [ __ ] you know

3638
02:22:58,318 --> 02:23:03,000
in the wrong place and it was just some

3639
02:23:00,359 --> 02:23:05,579
some [ __ ] that was in it and it was

3640
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:08,219
frustrating that people had put it out

3641
02:23:05,579 --> 02:23:10,739
in such volume that it was

3642
02:23:08,219 --> 02:23:13,199
fake you know that it was real and then

3643
02:23:10,739 --> 02:23:15,180
it was fake but at the same time it was

3644
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:16,740
like well you know it's the last time

3645
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:19,620
I'm ever going to do that without just

3646
02:23:16,739 --> 02:23:21,659
being like hey you know if I heard I

3647
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:23,340
heard something about so and so like is

3648
02:23:21,659 --> 02:23:26,818
there is there is that is there any

3649
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:28,920
truth to that or you know so uh that was

3650
02:23:26,818 --> 02:23:31,439
that was my experience with it so I was

3651
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:33,960
like man [ __ ] Jokers like it you know

3652
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:34,620
because it uh was

3653
02:23:33,959 --> 02:23:37,619
um

3654
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:39,479
you know like I can think oh man it was

3655
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:41,460
embarrassing for me but the reality was

3656
02:23:39,478 --> 02:23:43,318
like my real thing was I just felt like

3657
02:23:41,459 --> 02:23:46,438
[ __ ] because I was like damn like how'd

3658
02:23:43,318 --> 02:23:48,119
I make him feel you know so

3659
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:50,520
um that was that was what that's how

3660
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:53,160
that went you know [ __ ] Dumbass

3661
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:55,920
Dumbass gene on that one so

3662
02:23:53,159 --> 02:23:58,739
oh man too harsh on yourself I I'm sure

3663
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:00,000
he probably wasn't too put off fire but

3664
02:23:58,739 --> 02:24:01,379
there you go a good answer to the

3665
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,719
situation

3666
02:24:01,379 --> 02:24:05,818
so a new question I've been allowing to

3667
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:07,379
ask all the guests recently before we

3668
02:24:05,818 --> 02:24:09,959
wrap things up

3669
02:24:07,379 --> 02:24:12,059
do you have any other passions in life

3670
02:24:09,959 --> 02:24:15,000
besides breeding we see on Instagram

3671
02:24:12,059 --> 02:24:18,239
like a lot of breeders like to breed

3672

3674
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:26,120
aspect of me and Gene which the public

3675
02:24:22,379 --> 02:24:26,119
isn't aware you're invested in

3676

that kind of [ __ ] like if it was easier

3714
02:26:02,639 --> 02:26:07,799
to be involved in like making movies and

3715
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:10,500
[ __ ] I'd probably want to be you know

3716
02:26:07,799 --> 02:26:12,299
want to do some of that but it's not

3717
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:15,299
something I have that much ambition in

3718
02:26:12,299 --> 02:26:16,318
but I really do love uh I love that kind

3719
02:26:15,299 --> 02:26:18,079
of stuff

3720
02:26:16,318 --> 02:26:21,898
um

3721
02:26:18,079 --> 02:26:24,000
and uh you know I mean I like food I

3722
02:26:21,898 --> 02:26:27,959
like to cook there's not there's not

3723
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:33,180
really anything that I'm as into as

3724
02:26:27,959 --> 02:26:35,879
um as I am into weed you know but um

3725
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:38,280
but I like you know I'm into I'm into

3726
02:26:35,879 --> 02:26:40,259
stuff that uh involves checking out

3727
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:42,720
Aesthetics and stuff and but as far as

3728
02:26:40,260 --> 02:26:44,939
doing stuff making stuff made some music

3729
02:26:42,719 --> 02:26:48,119
over the years like I said I like the

3730
02:26:44,939 --> 02:26:49,979
mixing making remixes mashups

3731
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:52,979
you're probably my main things really

3732
02:26:49,978 --> 02:26:55,260
I'm pretty simple I like to

3733
02:26:52,978 --> 02:26:57,858
observe things I like to absorb

3734
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:57,859
information

3735
02:26:57,898 --> 02:27:03,239
um you know so I like to read stuff I

3736
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:04,080
like to check stuff out like that

3737
02:27:03,239 --> 02:27:05,879
um

3738
02:27:04,079 --> 02:27:08,159
love to go to the river in the

3739
02:27:05,879 --> 02:27:10,139
summertime go swimming go to the ocean

3740
02:27:08,159 --> 02:27:13,439
like I really enjoy that

3741
02:27:10,139 --> 02:27:15,539
uh part of nature probably more than the

3742
02:27:13,439 --> 02:27:17,100
average person I just like really soaked

3743
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:18,000
that up that's like my happy place you

3744
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:19,439
know

3745
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,939
and

3746
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:22,800
um you know

3747
02:27:20,939 --> 02:27:25,680
family

3748
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:28,619
for me is big I really I really like

3749
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:31,200
chilling with my son and my family and

3750
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:33,720
it kind of sums up my life you know not

3751
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:35,220
super I like to travel a little bit but

3752
02:27:33,719 --> 02:27:36,840
it's not my thing like I have friends

3753
02:27:35,219 --> 02:27:38,459
who that's really what they're into is

3754
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:40,439
traveling I'm like cool I like to do it

3755
02:27:38,459 --> 02:27:41,339
sometimes but it usually takes it out of

3756
02:27:40,439 --> 02:27:43,859
me

3757
02:27:41,340 --> 02:27:45,359
um and I get I usually wind up getting

3758
02:27:43,859 --> 02:27:48,420
like burnt out and sick or something

3759
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:51,359
from either partying too hard or just

3760
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:54,299
the travel and the stress of the actual

3761
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:57,059
travel and [ __ ] but um but I like that

3762
02:27:54,299 --> 02:27:59,759
too and um

3763
02:27:57,059 --> 02:28:01,920
you know I'm pretty uh I'm pretty simple

3764
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:02,939
I don't really have anything that's like

3765
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:05,398
a big

3766
02:28:02,939 --> 02:28:07,920
a big thing that I like to like you know

3767
02:28:05,398 --> 02:28:08,879
spend money on or

3768
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:11,520
um

3769
02:28:08,879 --> 02:28:13,259
you know I just just kind of chill

3770
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:14,880
pretty pretty

3771
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:17,100
um

3772
02:28:14,879 --> 02:28:20,279
yeah pretty simple dude

3773
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:21,780
a man of Simple Pleasures I like that I

3774
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:24,120
like that a lot

3775
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:26,340
so this brings us to our final five

3776
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:27,600
quick fire questions pretty confident

3777
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:30,478
they're different to the ones you did

3778
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:34,559
last time so I'm excited to hear the

3779
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:37,978
answers to this one uh first one is what

3780
02:28:34,559 --> 02:28:40,559
is the absolute most memorable cannabis

3781
02:28:37,978 --> 02:28:43,199
experience you've ever had be it smoking

3782
02:28:40,559 --> 02:28:45,239
flower hash being somewhere doing

3783
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,620
something which one stands out the most

3784
02:28:45,239 --> 02:28:49,318
to you

3785
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:51,000
oh man

3786
02:28:49,318 --> 02:28:53,459
um

3787
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,780
there was definitely some some memories

3788
02:28:53,459 --> 02:28:56,579
that were

3789
02:28:54,780 --> 02:28:58,739
that were really interesting like

3790
02:28:56,579 --> 02:29:00,600
getting getting way too high and being

3791
02:28:58,739 --> 02:29:03,299
like almost blacked out when I was young

3792
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:05,040
where you know they just have that

3793
02:29:03,299 --> 02:29:06,478
impact of being like holy [ __ ] I think

3794
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:09,000
I'm going to be high for the rest of my

3795
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:11,459
life like I'm just you know you're just

3796
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:14,639
clouded in a daze and you know those

3797
02:29:11,459 --> 02:29:16,699
kind of those kind of stand out and then

3798
02:29:14,639 --> 02:29:16,699
um

3799
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:21,960
um you know I don't know like just

3800
02:29:19,799 --> 02:29:24,000
everything is so much weed man like I

3801
02:29:21,959 --> 02:29:26,699
don't it's not anything that stands out

3802
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,639
but one really crazy one was uh one time

3803
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:31,680
I took a bong hit dude and I stood up to

3804
02:29:29,639 --> 02:29:34,379
go spit in the in the in the bathroom

3805
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:36,420
sink as bomb heads sometimes have to

3806
02:29:34,379 --> 02:29:39,659
spit after they're coughing and stuff

3807
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:41,159
and I went to stand up and I got a

3808
02:29:39,659 --> 02:29:43,139
little light-headed so I sat back down

3809
02:29:41,159 --> 02:29:46,379
on this big bean bag and

3810
02:29:43,139 --> 02:29:47,939
then I stood back up because I was good

3811
02:29:46,379 --> 02:29:49,559
and I went and I spit in the bathroom

3812
02:29:47,939 --> 02:29:51,960
and I went and came back and I started

3813
02:29:49,559 --> 02:29:54,359
getting a little bit like kind of kind

3814
02:29:51,959 --> 02:29:57,358
of my vision started getting white you

3815
02:29:54,359 --> 02:30:00,059
know and so I went to like kind of belly

3816
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:02,159
flop onto the bean bag but as I was

3817
02:30:00,059 --> 02:30:04,199
going to belly flop onto the bean bag I

3818
02:30:02,159 --> 02:30:06,000
like lost Consciousness and my body

3819
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:07,439
moved a little bit and I fell to the

3820
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,620
side of the beanbag

3821
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:13,920
and when I woke up my my jaw was so

3822
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:16,200
dislocated that like my my one my right

3823
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:18,239
side of my teeth was underneath the left

3824
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:20,880
side of my top teeth like the bottom

3825
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:24,780
bottom right was underneath the top left

3826
02:30:20,879 --> 02:30:26,519
you know what I mean like my jaw was

3827
02:30:24,780 --> 02:30:30,540
completely dislocated to the point where

3828
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:32,819
I was like damn oh am I gonna die or or

3829
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:34,680
like in that like still that's why I

3830
02:30:32,818 --> 02:30:36,600
said like good things or bad things that

3831
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:39,000
still stands out as the craziest [ __ ]

3832
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:42,000
weed experience I ever had

3833
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:45,780
because I thought I had like ruined my

3834
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:47,100
life like to look I wish if if they back

3835
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:48,780
then if it would have been like we had

3836
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:51,000
camera phones around all the time and I

3837
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:54,899
had a picture of it you would be like

3838
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:57,600
holy [ __ ] [ __ ] because my my my my

3839
02:30:54,898 --> 02:31:01,199
whole face was just [ __ ] twisted

3840
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:04,079
around the wrong way I was nuts dude

3841
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:06,240
um and that was that has to be like the

3842
02:31:04,079 --> 02:31:08,159
craziest weed experience ever and it was

3843
02:31:06,239 --> 02:31:11,879
just a [ __ ] bong hit you know but it

3844
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:14,100
was like dude it was insane all my all

3845
02:31:11,879 --> 02:31:16,978
my teeth were bleeding between the teeth

3846
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:19,380
you know because I had hit so hard yeah

3847
02:31:16,978 --> 02:31:21,959
and I had this big berry on my chin and

3848
02:31:19,379 --> 02:31:23,639
I was like man I I had to straighten it

3849
02:31:21,959 --> 02:31:25,739
out you know I had to like open my mouth

3850
02:31:23,639 --> 02:31:26,459
real wide and push on the sides and it

3851
02:31:25,739 --> 02:31:28,859
like

3852
02:31:26,459 --> 02:31:31,799
[ __ ] popped back in and it you know

3853
02:31:28,859 --> 02:31:34,680
it it it it never was 100 you know it's

3854
02:31:31,799 --> 02:31:36,959
still a little tiny bit off this you

3855
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:39,239
know 20 years later [ __ ] was nuts

3856
02:31:36,959 --> 02:31:42,119
but uh that's a crazy story

3857
02:31:39,239 --> 02:31:44,879
yeah wow I think we've got a new

3858
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:47,160
Benchmark with that one on the other end

3859
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:50,219
of the spectrum we're gonna think least

3860
02:31:47,159 --> 02:31:51,898
memorable was there ever a time when all

3861
02:31:50,219 --> 02:31:53,760
of the people you know hang out with

3862
02:31:51,898 --> 02:31:55,379
were just like super hyped on this

3863
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:57,420
certain strain and then when you finally

3864
02:31:55,379 --> 02:31:58,920
got around to trying it you were like ah

3865
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:01,100
is that it

3866
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:01,100
foreign

3867
02:32:02,159 --> 02:32:07,619
I don't know I mean you know usually

3868
02:32:05,159 --> 02:32:10,260
things haven't been

3869
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:12,120
um super hyped or if they are so hyped

3870
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:13,620
then I kind of assume they're gonna suck

3871
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:15,540
anyway and then when I see them I'm like

3872
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:17,640
this is actually pretty good you know

3873
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:19,380
so uh that's not something that I've

3874
02:32:17,639 --> 02:32:21,898
experienced a whole lot

3875
02:32:19,379 --> 02:32:23,759
I wouldn't say

3876
02:32:21,898 --> 02:32:25,739
yeah that's that's good considering

3877
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:29,280
you've been living in the heart of the

3878
02:32:25,739 --> 02:32:31,199
weed Mecca since the start really so the

3879
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:33,239
next question would be if you're about

3880
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:35,100
to be dropped off at a desert island and

3881
02:32:33,239 --> 02:32:36,539
you can only take three strains with you

3882
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:38,100
that you've got to smoke for the rest of

3883
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:39,180
your life which three would you take

3884
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:42,300
with you

3885
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:45,840
but definitely take line one

3886
02:32:42,299 --> 02:32:48,000
I'd probably take root beer or anything

3887
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:50,760
that's kind of in there in that mix of

3888
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:54,139
the jarrow stuff

3889
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:54,139
um and then

3890
02:32:54,299 --> 02:32:56,420
um

3891
02:32:58,818 --> 02:33:02,478
a third one

3892
02:33:04,079 --> 02:33:09,180
yeah I don't know maybe just because it

3893
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:12,899
would be a good a good

3894
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:14,939
the other side of it and I've I know

3895
02:33:12,898 --> 02:33:16,439
what it's like to have not had it which

3896
02:33:14,939 --> 02:33:18,720
I and I really like it it's really

3897
02:33:16,439 --> 02:33:21,180
enjoyable for me I like that sweat

3898
02:33:18,719 --> 02:33:22,679
but I don't know if I would put it as in

3899
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:25,500
the in the top

3900
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:28,318
in the top three as a third one would be

3901
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:30,299
like then it gets hard you know like I

3902
02:33:28,318 --> 02:33:32,818
really know lime one's my favorite I

3903
02:33:30,299 --> 02:33:34,559
really know root beer I love to smoke

3904
02:33:32,818 --> 02:33:37,500
anytime when I'm like I've already

3905
02:33:34,559 --> 02:33:40,260
smoked a bunch of lime and then after

3906
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:41,818
that it's like a big wheel of a bunch of

3907
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:43,920
different stuff and then I would be I

3908
02:33:41,818 --> 02:33:46,920
wouldn't be super super concerned as

3909
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:48,719
long as I knew I had as long as I knew I

3910
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,799
had the lime and then something else you

3911
02:33:48,719 --> 02:33:51,599
know

3912
02:33:49,799 --> 02:33:55,318
yeah that's a nice little selection

3913
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:57,540
there so if we flip the tables now and

3914
02:33:55,318 --> 02:33:59,818
you're going to be dropping off someone

3915
02:33:57,540 --> 02:34:01,680
who you're not particularly fond of to

3916
02:33:59,818 --> 02:34:04,019
that same island and you get to choose

3917
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:06,800
what three strains they get which three

3918
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:06,800
are you going to give them

3919
02:34:08,939 --> 02:34:16,460
some kind of cardboardy

3920
02:34:11,459 --> 02:34:18,659
peanut Shelly Rooter Alice oh love it

3921
02:34:16,459 --> 02:34:21,898
I mean I just remember like some

3922
02:34:18,659 --> 02:34:23,639
ruderalis stuff that had that kind of uh

3923
02:34:21,898 --> 02:34:26,279
you know where it's just like there's

3924
02:34:23,639 --> 02:34:27,898
nothing really redeeming about the smell

3925
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:31,319
and then you smoke it and you don't

3926
02:34:27,898 --> 02:34:33,959
really get a high you would want and uh

3927
02:34:31,318 --> 02:34:35,699
that's like you know like the basically

3928
02:34:33,959 --> 02:34:38,459
what I think a lot of people would

3929
02:34:35,700 --> 02:34:40,620
recognize as the auto flowers that you

3930
02:34:38,459 --> 02:34:42,779
don't want I think a lot of people have

3931
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:44,220
probably seen that style I I can see it

3932
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:46,560
in pictures all the time people are like

3933
02:34:44,219 --> 02:34:49,559
oh I got this Autoflower such and such

3934
02:34:46,559 --> 02:34:52,619
and I'm like yeah that's that that's

3935
02:34:49,559 --> 02:34:55,318
that very undesirable Rooter Alice look

3936
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:58,380
with the really dark red hairs that has

3937
02:34:55,318 --> 02:35:00,000
like the this dark greenness to it and

3938
02:34:58,379 --> 02:35:01,739
just not there's something there's this

3939
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,600
thing and it's like I know that type and

3940
02:35:01,739 --> 02:35:06,500
I can see it as soon as I see it I know

3941
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:09,300
it's just that plain

3942
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:11,760
kind of just this that the high that

3943
02:35:09,299 --> 02:35:13,978
just doesn't really do much for you and

3944
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:15,719
uh that would be that's like my kind of

3945
02:35:13,978 --> 02:35:18,599
my least favorite thing that I can think

3946
02:35:15,719 --> 02:35:20,459
of and I've seen it come out you know of

3947
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:22,380
different stuff like even out of kind of

3948
02:35:20,459 --> 02:35:23,759
cool afghanis and then it'll pop out and

3949
02:35:22,379 --> 02:35:25,318
you're like oh there's that [ __ ]

3950
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:26,219
thing

3951
02:35:25,318 --> 02:35:29,159
um

3952
02:35:26,219 --> 02:35:31,500
and then

3953
02:35:29,159 --> 02:35:34,318
oh

3954
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:36,420
you know [ __ ]

3955
02:35:34,318 --> 02:35:39,079
um

3956
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:43,280
I don't know

3957
02:35:39,079 --> 02:35:44,879
it's really I really like plants a lot

3958
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:47,460
so

3959
02:35:44,879 --> 02:35:49,318
for me even things that people might go

3960
02:35:47,459 --> 02:35:52,438
oh that's terrible somebody will tell

3961
02:35:49,318 --> 02:35:56,279
you oh I can't stand Jack or I can't

3962
02:35:52,439 --> 02:36:00,600
stand train wreck or I can't stand a

3963
02:35:56,280 --> 02:36:02,520
blue dream or or I hate uh I hate

3964
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:05,880
whatever it is that they really don't

3965
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:08,359
like I kind of I kind of like weed like

3966
02:36:05,879 --> 02:36:11,818
you know

3967
02:36:08,359 --> 02:36:14,340
I can tell you what's really gnarly and

3968
02:36:11,818 --> 02:36:17,219
what's not as gnarly but a lot of the

3969
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:19,439
stuff that's just you know whatever I'm

3970
02:36:17,219 --> 02:36:21,898
still kind of like uh I'm still kind of

3971
02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:23,818
just impressed that it's weed if that

3972
02:36:21,898 --> 02:36:27,478
makes any sense like

3973
02:36:23,818 --> 02:36:29,639
it's cannabis I mean I don't want to be

3974
02:36:27,478 --> 02:36:32,699
that guy but like

3975
02:36:29,639 --> 02:36:35,159
if somebody has some weed I'm like hey

3976
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:37,380
that's some weed I remember times when

3977
02:36:35,159 --> 02:36:39,299
like I was saying

3978
02:36:37,379 --> 02:36:41,039
like somebody has some moldy weed and

3979
02:36:39,299 --> 02:36:43,619
you're like [ __ ] it it's weed

3980
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:46,740
you know so for me

3981
02:36:43,620 --> 02:36:48,720
even though I you know I have access to

3982
02:36:46,739 --> 02:36:52,920
what people consider to be what's the

3983
02:36:48,719 --> 02:36:53,699
goods and and whatnot I still

3984
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:55,799
um

3985
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:58,079
that's there's that one type that just

3986
02:36:55,799 --> 02:36:59,938
leaves it leaves a bad taste in my mouth

3987
02:36:58,079 --> 02:37:01,680
just like the memories of it as like

3988
02:36:59,939 --> 02:37:03,479
wheat as far as because it's a strain

3989
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:06,659
that I can really put a finger on and go

3990
02:37:03,478 --> 02:37:09,659
that one but other than that you know I

3991
02:37:06,659 --> 02:37:11,398
I don't think that um

3992
02:37:09,659 --> 02:37:13,200
I don't think anything's too terrible I

3993
02:37:11,398 --> 02:37:15,299
think honestly if you were on a [ __ ]

3994
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:17,220
desert island and someone dropped you

3995
02:37:15,299 --> 02:37:21,079
off with whatever you'd be like [ __ ] I'm

3996
02:37:17,219 --> 02:37:21,079
glad this is cannabis dude you know

3997
02:37:21,799 --> 02:37:28,978
amen amen what a good answer

3998
02:37:25,318 --> 02:37:30,959
so on to our final question if you could

3999
02:37:28,978 --> 02:37:34,079
go back in time to anywhere any place

4000
02:37:30,959 --> 02:37:37,759
and collect some seeds or a clone which

4001
02:37:34,079 --> 02:37:37,760
one are you going to go back and get

4002
02:37:39,059 --> 02:37:42,779
um so I think last time I said I'd like

4003
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:45,120
to go

4004
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:46,800
like to the Hindu Kush region back in

4005
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:49,200
the day

4006
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:51,199
um and Hunt around and look

4007
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:51,200
um

4008
02:37:51,478 --> 02:37:58,019
so we already know that so outside of

4009
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:59,819
that man we have this White Widow in the

4010
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:01,979
in the 90s

4011
02:37:59,818 --> 02:38:04,500
and we have this Northern Lights in the

4012
02:38:01,978 --> 02:38:06,478
90s and I had this dirt purp clone in

4013
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:08,040
the [ __ ] 90s that was so good and we

4014
02:38:06,478 --> 02:38:10,679
didn't realize how good it was and we

4015
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:12,060
had already killed the moms

4016
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:14,880
um

4017
02:38:12,059 --> 02:38:17,100
for me personally I would say I'd

4018
02:38:14,879 --> 02:38:19,079
probably want to go back right to that

4019
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:21,840
little slice of time when I still had

4020
02:38:19,079 --> 02:38:23,520
all three of those things and when I

4021
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:25,620
know that there was tons of people who

4022
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:27,120
had other stuff that I was too shy to

4023
02:38:25,620 --> 02:38:29,100
ask for

4024
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:32,040
I'd probably just write go back to the

4025
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:32,880
90s in this area grab the stuff that I

4026
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:35,640
had

4027
02:38:32,879 --> 02:38:37,379
and that I lost and then start knocking

4028
02:38:35,639 --> 02:38:39,119
on my friend's doors and asking their

4029
02:38:37,379 --> 02:38:41,099
parents for the stuff that I was too shy

4030
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:43,380
to ask for

4031
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:45,720
um you know and and I know there's a lot

4032
02:38:43,379 --> 02:38:47,579
of other places to go

4033
02:38:45,719 --> 02:38:49,438
and there's all kinds of neat stuff to

4034
02:38:47,579 --> 02:38:51,898
find but like those are the things for

4035
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:53,220
me personally as opposed to going you

4036
02:38:51,898 --> 02:38:54,959
know these are the things that really

4037
02:38:53,219 --> 02:38:57,179
should be brought to the community I

4038
02:38:54,959 --> 02:38:59,699
just want to I would I would want to go

4039
02:38:57,180 --> 02:39:03,239
back and just get the [ __ ] that I have

4040
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:05,399
seen that we had that I smoked and I had

4041
02:39:03,239 --> 02:39:07,680
my hands on and I remember it and it's

4042
02:39:05,398 --> 02:39:09,318
gone I just want all that [ __ ] that

4043
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:13,020
would probably be like

4044
02:39:09,318 --> 02:39:15,478
1996 or something like that you know

4045
02:39:13,020 --> 02:39:17,640
yeah brilliant answer I guess you know

4046
02:39:15,478 --> 02:39:19,679
the first episode we got seeds second

4047
02:39:17,639 --> 02:39:22,318
episode we got clients so it kind of

4048
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:24,000
rounds it out yeah seeds too though when

4049
02:39:22,318 --> 02:39:25,978
I'm talking about that those you know

4050
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,478
that's for me there was those few clones

4051
02:39:25,978 --> 02:39:30,000
but then I'd want to go get all those

4052
02:39:27,478 --> 02:39:31,619
seeds from the from the from the family

4053
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,379
friends you know

4054
02:39:31,620 --> 02:39:37,560

4055
