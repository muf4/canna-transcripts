115
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,478
Smorgasbord there's a bunch of stuff I

116
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,699
want to ask you I guess first thing that

117
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,319
comes to mind what what was like the

118
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,000
most standout from all the things you

119
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,918
tried it doesn't like not necessarily

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,478
unique or maybe it is unique but what

121
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,339
just has left a really lasting

122
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,539
impression on you

123
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:13,198
um

124
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,939
you know I uh it's it's people are gonna

125
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,080
laugh but

126
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:23,038
I really enjoyed my buddy Pax blue dream

127
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,139
uh oh yeah it you know some strains get

128
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,060
a bad name because they get overproduced

129
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,280
or they get grown like for on Commercial

130
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,079
levels and stuff

131
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,000
um but the reason why it got popular in

132
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,859
the first place was like grown well it's

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,319
pretty incredible

134
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,300
um so I the blue dream was really nice

135
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,819
his train wreck was also really nice

136
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,379
both were like very classic and took me

137
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,719
back

138
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,060
um my uh my buddy hyen Lonesome his

139
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,060
Shoreline

140
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,740
uh which is like very 90s to me type of

141
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,060
type of weed

142
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,918
um

143
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,839
you know I don't know there's there was

144
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,879
just some really nice cushes uh there

145
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,219
was some weird sativas there and stuff

146
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,038
so I like

147
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,320
I almost enjoy the weed more when I'm

148
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,000
home because when you try to have some

149
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,680
kind of gathering like that I don't know

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,839
about you but like once you start

151
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,439
smoking six seven eight nine ten twelve

152
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:19,379
kinds of weed uh in short duration you

153
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,939
sort of like lose the ability to like uh

154
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,259
generate what you think of each

155
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,660
individual one

156
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,080
uh yeah yeah yeah it starts to become

157
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,120
like a haze yeah where you know when I'm

158
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,099
home I could take a couple of bong hits

159
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,720
or smoke half a joint of something and

160
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,340
then start like you know doing some

161
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,740
chores or whatever and I'll get a real

162
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,619
good sense of like what kind of Journey

163
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,300
that that herb takes me on and and you

164
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,918
can do that over some time and you can

165
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,100
kind of look at each individual one

166
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,538
without it being like uh you know one on

167
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,460
top of the other on top of the other on

168
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,279
top of the other because once you're in

169
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:56,099
sort of like a weed festival event like

170
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,079
that it's mostly what you you notice

171
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,379
what tastes good and what cuts through

172
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,740
the other ones yeah but it's certainly a

173
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,860
cumulative effect right

174
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,680
uh so but yeah I mean it it was nice

175
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,020
that we did that you know uh we we used

176
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,300
to do it you know I mean uh you went to

177
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,978
one you went to a few of them um we used

178
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,259
to do it around the emerald Cup in Santa

179
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,779
Rosa just because everyone was gathering

180
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,400
uh and so we would have these you know

181
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,719
get togethers we'd rent a house and we'd

182
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,758
have some get-togethers at night so

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,460
people could come and just shoot the

184
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,220
[ __ ] and enjoy themselves and then kovid

185
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,258
kind of put a lid on that

186
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,259
um for a few years unfortunately so then

187
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,240
this uh winner we pulled off like a very

188
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,740
small family based one where just a

189
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,439
bunch of friends brought

190
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,478
you know we just cooked and ate and and

191
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,399
smoked and chatted for a couple of days

192
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,918
and it was super nice

193
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,500
yeah man that's I I remember the event

194
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,180
in um I think it was actually 2019 I was

195
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,939
able to come to that last one before

196
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,819
covert hit and definitely a who's who

197
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,680
event I think uh even myself who

198
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,539
admittedly I don't get quite as Star

199
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,639
Struck as I used to I remember being at

200
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:07,079
that party and every time I turned my

201
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,759
head I would be like oh my God that's

202
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,038
such and such you know that's rude boy

203
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,900
and just just people you weren't

204
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,459
expecting to see and I guess it brings

205
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,258
up an interesting question you know a

206
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,299
lot of people including you know some of

207
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,400
the real heady guys feel like the

208
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,379
emerald cup is not really what it used

209
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,378
to be do you think these small scale

210
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,180
events are like the way forward well I

211
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,960
would say that um

212
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,820
they've always sort of been there right

213
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,519
uh so the difference the difference

214
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,060
obviously is like the emerald cup is uh

215
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,620
a commercial style event

216
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,838
and that's obviously going to change

217
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,099
with like the rules and regulations and

218
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,500
what they allow and what they don't

219
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,360
right the party that I was just

220
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,100
describing is is more of like a

221
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,240
traditional in my mind like Harvest

222
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,360
Festival

223
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,200
where it's sort of invite only uh all

224
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,539
and uh you it's not it's just basically

225
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,600
like a gathering of people I mean there

226
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:06,059
used to be a guy um he's still around uh

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,820
that would throw a very similar kind of

228
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,579
uh of gathering um at his house 20 years

229
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,680
ago 20 a couple years 22 years ago

230
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,360
something like that maybe

231
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,799
um and he would rent

232
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
um a night a really nice house in

233
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,699
Healdsburg which is uh in Northern

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,220
Sonoma County and just have a bunch of

235
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,980
friends gather and that's actually where

236
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,980
I first met uh CSI

237
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,139
uh it's where I first met uh chip from

238
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,899
uh Royal gold although he didn't have

239
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,278
Royal gold back then I met Shaw shaba

240
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,899
there

241
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,000
um you know and then you talk to

242
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,940
Old-Timers and stuff and there's been

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,240
Harvest festivals going on since the 70s

244
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,519
and 80s in Mendo and Humboldt

245
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,560
um so I would classify that one as sort

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,139
of like a just an informal Gathering of

247
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,659
friends where you have food and drink

248
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,000
and smoke and you just basically chat

249
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,939
and get a chance to to hang out a bit

250
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,399
where the emerald cup is sort of like uh

251
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,800
a commercial event

252
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,360
um you know yeah definitely doesn't mean

253
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,719
it can't be cool because you're still

254
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,600
Gathering a bunch of people but you know

255
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,580
215 the medical era was sort of like uh

256
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,500
a lot of those Harvest festivals like

257
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,180
Emerald cup was sort of like a gray area

258
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,179
swap meet

259
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,439
in the sense that you could rent a booth

260
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,399
and you could kind of do whatever you

261
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,320
wanted

262
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,940
you could sell dabs you could sell weed

263
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,100
you could sell t-shirts you could sell

264
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,260
stickers you could advertise your farm

265
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,360
all these different things and all you

266
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,179
needed was you know a little bit of tax

267
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,159
work and and some uh and some money and

268
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,439
and a medical

269
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:44,039
and now that uh

270
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,839
now that it's fully legal and regulated

271
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,819
um everything has to fit into those

272
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,560
rules so a lot of the people and a lot

273
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,839
of the activities that used to go on an

274
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,838
emerald cup no longer fit within the

275
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,060
rules so it changes it yeah definitely

276
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,860
and I want to loop back on that point

277
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,139
but I want to ask you about a few of the

278
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,240
strains because you you know you you

279
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:04,980
just mentioned like some of the all-time

280
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,839
greats in what you were able to sample

281
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,820
while you were there so I'd love to look

282
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,500
back you mentioned your friend you know

283
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,200
brought some amazing train wrecks and

284
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,159
blue dream is that um Santa Cruz goat

285
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,720
farmer it is yeah oh man I've only just

286
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,179
recently because of you know yourself

287
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,060
and Matt been sort of put on to him and

288
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:25,979
I love it it's like you know I say this

289
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,319
very regularly but like I think if you

290
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,360
live outside of America it's maybe not

291
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,060
an obvious point but like the rest of

292
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,100
the world is not burnt out on Jack Herer

293
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,838
on Blue Dream on train wreck you know

294
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,480
we're all still very much like yourself

295
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,300
enjoying what is arguably some of the

296
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,459
best genetics out there did you find

297
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,379
yourself personally ever getting burnt

298
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,659
out on those strains or was it more just

299
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:52,320
the community

300
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:54,480
um you know so

301
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,720
um there's there's a couple ways to look

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,180
at it right is that uh whenever anything

303
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,440
becomes a a big deal and train wreck is

304
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,659
kind of important because it was like

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,720
one of the first named clones to really

306
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:09,958
get grown and humbled by a lot of people

307
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,180
uh and so what happens is in a lot of

308
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,819
times is that these strains for whatever

309
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,399
reason they get popular there's a demand

310
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,459
Forum people start growing them people

311
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,200
start growing more of them and then in

312
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,359
the beginning most of it is really good

313
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,920
and then as more and more people get

314
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,740
into it and they go bigger and bigger

315
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:32,458
and you know like it gets the quality

316
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,940
gets gets not as good so getting some

317
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:37,799
like eight pound outdoor blue dream uh

318
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,500
that was grown commercially might not be

319
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,539
very good right and most people are

320
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,700
going to be encountering blue dream in

321
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:46,439
that way right

322
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,600
um but getting like a little two three

323
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,000
four ounce indoor plant grown with love

324
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,500
or a greenhouse plant grown With Love by

325
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,539
your buddy

326
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,399
um You probably will see the qualities

327
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,439
that let it to be popular in the first

328
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,139
place right

329
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,420
and so most of these things whether it's

330
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:07,079
train wreck or

331
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,519
um blue dream or Grape Ape or Urkel or

332
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:12,179
uh you know

333
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,100
um granddaddy purple or OG or you know

334
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,719
go through the list it's like they have

335
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,240
their moment in the Sun

336
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,100
and then it becomes easier to move

337
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,139
something else for the market so the

338
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,959
market shifts but it doesn't mean that

339
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,579
that strain is any less nice

340
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,679
it just means there's something that's

341
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:32,338
easier for people to move

342
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:36,179
right and so then you know people go

343
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,839
with what uh with what what the craze is

344
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,078
um

345
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,899
in the probably 040506

346
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,000
I would say every indoor grower in

347
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,620
Humboldt and Mendo for the most part

348
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,620
was probably

349
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,139
bumping out some kind of purple

350
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,560
because the market just had an insane

351
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,959
insatiable demand for it uh and that's

352
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,119
where granddaddy purple and Urkel and

353
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,578
Mendo p and all those things became kind

354
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,659
of famous because they went they went

355
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:09,239
easy they went for top dollar and then

356
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:11,639
98 of people dropped them when the sour

357
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,680
and Kush era hit

358
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,839
and then a bunch of people dropped sour

359
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,539
and Kush when the Skittles you know

360
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,060
cookie era hit and so on and so forth

361
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,919
and then the purple era came back

362
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,539
uh the last three four years in

363
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,458
California but instead of being those

364
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,860
classic strains it was hybrids of them

365
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,199
like you know it was gelato or this or

366
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,778
that or you know it's not purple enough

367
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:39,720
and so uh I think that most people don't

368
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,519
want to hold on to any any strain that

369
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,120
they're not currently

370
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,220
making money off of for the most part uh

371
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,198
and so as a result of that

372
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,600
you know there's strains that are very

373
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,539
popular that tons and tons of people had

374
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,180
at one point that either become lost or

375
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:59,639
only ended up holding in a few hands

376
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:02,219
because people had to hold on to it when

377
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,440
it wasn't popular or wasn't popping

378
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,240
because they cared about it and it

379
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,880
happens over and over again

380
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,620
you know uh it really does yeah it

381
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,019
definitely goes in Cycles doesn't it

382
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,299
well you know to give some kudos to uh

383
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,560
the Santa Cruz goat farmer I would love

384
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,659
to know you know you've got a vast

385
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,458
experience growing a range of different

386
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,139
strains so I'm sure even if you haven't

387
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,419
grown any of them specifically you'd

388
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,159
have a good idea out of the sort of

389
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,439
train wreck lines he's put out which one

390
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,659
sort of grabs your eye the one that

391
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,720
impressed me the most and people will

392
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,639
laugh but is uh he had a train wreck

393
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,120
Blue Dream hybrid

394
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,600
and the reason that people have a hard

395
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,360
time with uh train wreck is because long

396
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,420
before we knew or used the word terpenes

397
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,459
right we would we would try to associate

398
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,278
tastes and smells with like certain

399
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:56,159
strains right so

400
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,500
um you know it has that strong you know

401
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,819
terpenolene that like you know people

402
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,320
back in the day used to be like oh it's

403
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,660
got those train wreck it's got that

404
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,560
train wreck nose yeah or it's got that

405
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:08,578
yeah it's got that Jack Herer nose right

406
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,119
um and now we know that that's

407
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:15,299
terpenoline uh and terpenolene is can be

408
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,480
a really sharp really astringent uh

409
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:21,659
flavor and it has I would say it's one

410
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,860
of the more controversial uh Aromas in

411
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:25,139
cannabis

412
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,940
uh because some people really enjoy it

413
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,940
and there's a large percentage of people

414
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,540
that dislike it very much uh so it

415
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,120
elicits strong opinions right

416
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:38,219
well he's got this train wreck blue

417
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,278
dream where the sweetness and the

418
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,800
softness of the Blue Dream really mutes

419
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,899
a lot of that astringent sharpness that

420
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,719
comes from the train wreck side so you

421
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:51,419
can still taste the terpenolene but it's

422
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,699
way more sweet and way more on the back

423
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,799
end instead of just being like

424
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:58,019
you know uh

425
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:01,139
lemon cleaner sprayed in your mouth or

426
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,600
something right yeah and I wasn't it's

427
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,640
very difficult like you if you ask CSI

428
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,459
you ask Matt or you ask various breeders

429
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,079
it's very difficult to mute terpenolene

430
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,620
which is why people get frustrated with

431
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:16,619
it because it is such a sharp forward

432
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,298
astringent flavor right

433
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,958
um and so I was pretty impressed by that

434
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:24,240
and you know generally speaking

435
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,039
uh

436
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,259
various people are going to have

437
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,339
different favorites in the community and

438
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:31,259
they're going to have different things

439
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:34,439
that they gravitate towards

440
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:36,839
and there's things that I have that I

441
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,600
love intensely that other friends of

442
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,279
mine don't like very much even though

443
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,219
they acknowledge it's really good weed

444
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,700
it's not their preference

445
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:50,220
so people like uh pack you know holding

446
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,019
on to train wreck and blue dream and

447
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,579
some other Classics because they love

448
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:55,740
them and they and they want to keep them

449
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:58,079
safe and they want to keep them around

450
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,079
uh and then they grow them with love and

451
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:04,079
care uh that's good weed usually yeah

452
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,759
certainly certainly and uh I remember

453
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,960
just when you were talking about you

454
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,058
know people getting sick of it I

455
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,460
remember a quote I heard from Tom Hill

456
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,259
when I was with him he took a smell of a

457
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,840
certain bud and he was like uh train

458
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:19,140
wreck where all flavor profiles go to

459
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,659
die and uh I remember that highlighted

460
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,880
the point but just uh to ask a sort of

461
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,620
related question to the side when you

462
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,900
were listing those strains you know blue

463
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,719
dream train wreck maybe even like you

464
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,460
know Calio and skunk and as we stepped

465
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,100
away from those towards say the more

466
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,440
cookies and Skittles era you helped me

467
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,579
to realize in the moment that some of

468
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,500
these more popular Australians were

469
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:43,079
definitely more hybrid maybe even a

470
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,298
little sativa leaning at times and we've

471
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,038
sort of moved a lot more towards Indica

472
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:48,779
leaning would you say that's

473
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,179
coincidental or do you think as a

474
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:53,639
community as a whole of a consumer base

475
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,860
people are sort of just more inclined to

476
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,100
indicas than sativas

477
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:00,959
I would say it's accidental

478
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:04,558
in fact

479
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,259
um you know uh

480
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,139
so there's a couple ways to look at it

481
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,759
when you when you're when things were

482
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,620
primarily outdoor

483
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,660
okay

484
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:19,500
um first of all like most of America

485
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,600
started on sativa because that was you

486
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,640
got free sativa seeds and the weed that

487
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,500
you bought because the weed was from

488
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,440
Thailand or it was from Colombia or it

489
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,419
was from Mexico or it was from wherever

490
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,740
uh where everything was sativa in the

491
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,320
beginning because that was the access

492
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,419
that you had if you got uh indicas it

493
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,099
was hashish right and that didn't come

494
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,100
with seeds

495
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:43,798
um for the most part so sativas were way

496
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:47,939
more prevalent in the country at first

497
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:50,759
and in the especially in the 60s and 70s

498
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,940
um it was primarily all people had and

499
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,220
then you know in the early to mid 70s

500
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,259
there was some like very small amounts

501
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,000
of people like maybe like Steve Murphy

502
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:02,279
up in the Pacific Northwest or different

503
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,519
little groups that started having a

504
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,740
little bit of indica and then

505
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,418
um I think like Old Timers and and

506
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,339
friends of mine that have like lived in

507
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,679
Humboldt their whole life like CSI have

508
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:16,798
told me that they you know it seems like

509
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,460
late 70s is when it started first really

510
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,079
spreading around Mendo and Humboldt okay

511
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,720
so you got to realize you're starting

512
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,000
with almost 100 sativa and then in the

513
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,380
late 70s and 80s people start injecting

514
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,500
some

515
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,900
um some Indica into it right

516
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,940
and fast forward a bunch and if you're

517
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,340
gonna grow outdoor in the Sun

518
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,620
you'd way rather grow some Sour Diesel

519
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:44,159
or some blue dream or something like

520
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:47,699
that uh versus like runs

521
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,980
because that sativa stretch that ability

522
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,080
like you know most things that yield big

523
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,120
have to get big

524
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,678
and in order to get big you have to have

525
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,000
a certain amount of stretch and you have

526
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,000
to have a certain amount of structure

527
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,380
involved and so growing some squat

528
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,940
little Indica that's only going to get

529
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,000
three or four feet tall isn't going to

530
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,519
do very many people very much good

531
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,740
so what people started doing is they

532
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,259
tried they started trying to blend the

533
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,359
two things right like can I get the high

534
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,980
and the flavor from the sativa and the

535
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,740
structure and the stretch but can I get

536
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,079
those dense buds on the indica and have

537
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,839
it finish in the climate that I'm in

538
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,678
yeah and that was really the start of it

539
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:30,359
and now I think with Instagram and with

540
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,340
pictures and all that and with the way

541
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,219
hype Works

542
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,439
um you know most most stuff gets popular

543
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,000
and it has very little to do with its

544
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,620
growth rate or anything like that it's

545
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,579
kind of whether or not it Just catches a

546
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:44,279
fire

547
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:45,720
and then it has this time in the Sun for

548
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,579
a minute I guess

549
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,579
right so I wouldn't say it's it's it's

550
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:52,379
more like a conscious thing where people

551
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:54,480
prefer because

552
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,580
I would say that the vast majority of

553
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,440
people smoking today probably haven't

554
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:59,460
smoked real train wreck or real blue

555
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,460
dream

556
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,919
or real Urkel or you know real Trinity

557
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,779
or real things that were popular 20 25

558
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,860
years ago just because that's a long

559
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,980
time ago now

560
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:13,439
so you can be smoking gelatos and runts

561
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,038
and cookies and this and that it's a lot

562
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,159
of what is popular is what's accessible

563
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,740
like can you get it yeah right

564
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,679
hugely and that makes a huge difference

565
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,240
so it's in in a way it's like I don't

566
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,340
know I don't know if People's

567
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,500
preferences are what they are or it's

568
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,139
just what people's access is

569
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,058
yeah that's that's a huge point I I

570
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,280
definitely really try to Echo to people

571
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:41,099
in Australia that you know even just

572
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,779
your ability to even write weed in the

573
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:44,879
grand scale of things is very much

574
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,519
defined by what your exposure is right

575
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,400
like if you've never had a truly Elite

576
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,259
clone can you really say one of your

577
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,580
clones is truly Elite you know I try to

578
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:55,558
talk to people about this and it's a

579
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,960
difficult concept for sure

580
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:00,058
before we get too far deep though I want

581
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,460
to quickly ask you though

582
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:04,918
do you think then based on sort of what

583
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,980
you're just saying that it is possible

584
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,900
that maybe we could get a real sativary

585
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,640
sort of strain to become popular because

586
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,980
like that's my dream like I've I've

587
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,720
totally become like this die-hard sativa

588
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,220
head and I really want to share it with

589
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,839
other people but it feels like such an

590
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,058
uphill battle and it got me to the point

591
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,099
of where I'm like is it is it just me

592
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:25,259
you know like maybe I just like sativas

593
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,939
and like most people don't but I guess

594
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,099
based on what you're saying like these

595
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,259
days it's a bit more about catching fire

596
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,839
and the the photogenicness of the plant

597
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:38,220
do you think it is possible

598
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:40,619
yeah sure of course it's 100 possible uh

599
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,038
I mean so if you if you were to go back

600
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:45,899
and you were to think about how weed is

601
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:46,500
distributed right

602
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,380
um

603
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,759
before medical really existed it was all

604
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,760
private dealers

605
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:56,759
and you would have to go and and and you

606
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,140
maybe however many dealers you knew you

607
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,980
had to figure out what they had access

608
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,200
to

609
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,259
and that was all you could get

610
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,360
right so it was very much like when you

611
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,220
were coming up and what kind of

612
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,678
connections you had and then as as

613
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,079
medical came in and stores opened you

614
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,880
could actually go in and look and buy a

615
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,819
wider variety of things

616
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,120
but those store owners weren't trying to

617
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,798
provide the widest you know categories

618
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,538
for their customer base that they could

619
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,119
and educate them they were trying to buy

620
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:29,279
nice weed for cheap so they could make a

621
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,139
big margin

622
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,079
and that still happens to today it's

623
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,679
it's there's not like

624
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,259
um

625
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,059
you know there's things that that maybe

626
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,220
could be popular

627
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:43,558
if you but you have to actually like how

628
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,558
are you going to get a hold of them yeah

629
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,538
right they're not that easily accessible

630
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,678
like if you were to walk into I don't

631
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:51,240
know how many when you were visiting

632
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,460
here I don't know how many dispensaries

633
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,859
you walked into

634
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,360
um but you know getting pure sativa is

635
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,399
not easy

636
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,199
so if you can't get it how are you going

637
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,500
to know if you like it or not

638
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,840
yeah for sure and I mean I have to be

639
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,298
honest you know it was actually a bit of

640
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:12,418
a sad sight to be seen and the three or

641
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:15,538
four dispensaries I did visit I uh I

642
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:17,640
picked up some connected California they

643
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:18,960
offered a strain called high-rise you

644
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,640
know and and they're one of the

645
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,558
companies that's touted as doing a bit

646
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,259
of a better job than most and you know

647
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,720
Ted seems to be like a passionate guy so

648
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,298
happy to support him and I tried this

649
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,159
bud and and I honestly thought the terp

650
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:33,900
profile on it was mold like I don't

651
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,000
think the bud was moldy but it smelled

652
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,620
like mold it was so off-putting and

653
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,058
definitely wasn't a sativa and it was

654
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,639
the only thing I could find that was a

655
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:44,700
sativa and I sort of thought man am I

656
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,679
seeing like the dying remnants of of

657
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,240
dispensaries and I'd love to get your

658
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,559
take in general you know what's your

659
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,019
thoughts when you walk into the average

660
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:55,379
dispensary is it different to mine is it

661
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:58,079
similar oh that it's I mean I it's

662
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,278
pretty political I suppose

663
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:04,460
um but I get I would say that

664
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:04,460
um

665
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,798
the reason why you are probably pretty

666
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:13,859
disappointed is because over the course

667
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,319
of the last number of years where you've

668
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:18,479
talked you know on this podcast you've

669
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,700
been able to talk to a wide variety of

670
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,079
people that love weed

671
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,880
um and that have some pretty nice

672
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,099
Collections and you've been able to

673
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,100
probably try and smoke a bunch of those

674
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:31,079
people's herb right yeah and Friends of

675
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:33,000
there's herb and that sort of starts

676
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,918
informing your palate and what you like

677
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,980
to smoke and then you go into a

678
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:41,700
dispensary which is is you go from labor

679
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,720
of love to capitalistic and that's a big

680
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,380
drop

681
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,159
um

682
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:50,159
right in quality and it's even been a

683
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,260
drop in quality from the medical era to

684
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,980
the legal era

685
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:57,599
uh strangely uh legalization might be

686
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,360
the only time that they've taken a black

687
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,879
market product and made it worse and

688
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:05,699
more expensive than it was in the

689
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:10,260
previous in the previous situation

690
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,120
um because in in the 215 era right

691
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:14,519
to give you an example

692
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,918
if you had a medical card and you were

693
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,740
growing medical cannabis where what you

694
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:23,059
were supposed to do with it right was

695
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:27,839
sell it to dispensaries yeah okay

696
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:29,579
because that was the the legal Outlet to

697
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,558
get to patients

698
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:33,298
right I mean you could obviously have

699
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,038
your own patient Network or whatever and

700
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:37,379
pass out free cannabis and all that type

701
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,038
of stuff but like that's that's how the

702
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:43,260
system was supposed to work right so as

703
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,919
a result of that you didn't have to have

704
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:49,980
like basically I could grow a 12 lighter

705
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:52,259
in my garage for instance and harvest

706
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,579
that and then with my medical card go

707
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,440
down to people I knew in various

708
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,460
dispensaries and you could buy that weed

709
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,000
directly

710
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:04,200
so dispensaries were able to get a lot

711
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,579
of different people's herb right and you

712
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,778
didn't have to have a big business you

713
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:08,579
didn't have to have regulation you

714
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:10,859
didn't have to pay all this money you

715
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,199
literally had to have a medical card and

716
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:17,038
you could do a dope deal

717
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,500
okay so in Southern California there was

718
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,658
this enormous train of people that would

719
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,960
come up to Humboldt and Mendo and Sonoma

720
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:27,299
and up here and buy indoor and then they

721
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,500
would take it down to the to the to the

722
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:31,319
bay or take it down to Southern

723
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,900
California to San Diego or LA and they

724
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,700
would sell that indoor for a premium to

725
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,120
the dispensaries down there

726
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,278
so as a result of that you know there

727
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,678
was still a wide variety of of good and

728
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,359
bad but there was some really really

729
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,480
really good Growers

730
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:51,538
that their weed was was getting dried

731
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,400
right and cured right and and a week

732
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:55,440
later somebody is buying at a dispensary

733
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,240
and it was really nice

734
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,120
and now with all the layers of

735
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,558
legalization and the commercialization I

736
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,579
would say

737
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:08,460
um that most legal weed is a lot closer

738
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:12,960
to what we would I would call beasters

739
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:15,120
than it was the best of the 215 era yeah

740
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,079
um and actually beasters from Canon you

741
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,359
know do you know what I mean when I say

742
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,339
beasters Obviously yeah yeah yeah so

743
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:24,240
beasters for people that don't know is

744
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,918
in the 90s when you know Canada loosened

745
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,359
up a bit before America did and people

746
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,419
started growing large amounts of

747
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,278
commercial indoor uh and then you know

748
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:34,559
shipping it for higher prices and

749
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,778
smuggling it into America and so that

750
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,178
was sort of America's First Taste of

751
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:41,339
like Warehouse grown large-scale

752
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,259
commercial indoor that was kind of grown

753
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,558
okay

754
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:50,879
and I think that modern legal

755
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:53,398
is much closer to that than it is some

756
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,620
somebody that you know is 8 or 10 or 12

757
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,259
or 15 lighter

758
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,058
um doing a really good job and caring

759
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:00,778
for their for their weed in a different

760
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:03,178
way

761
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:06,179
oh yeah hugely everything you just said

762
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,919
is is really bang on and um I will

763
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,840
preface you know I don't want to hold

764
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,460
the dispensaries to too high of a

765
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,038
standard it's a it's going to be hard to

766
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,480
keep up with you know some of the uh the

767
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:17,519
people who's weed I've been fortunate

768
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,880
enough to try but exactly what you said

769
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,519
I remember I I was able to come over for

770
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,159
one trip before outright legalization

771
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,500
occurred and I remember I am the first

772
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,240
dispenser I went to was in Colorado and

773
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,619
I got some admittedly like even by

774
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,798
today's standard some really nice

775
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:37,079
Gorilla Glue and uh some nice Forum cut

776
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,819
and I remembered and it was what you

777
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,460
said you know it obviously had come from

778
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:43,139
someone's small hobby grow in nearby

779
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,819
that dispensary who'd put a lot of love

780
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,520
into that grow you could really see it

781
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:49,918
and um I guess to have seen that

782
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,839
progressively sort of slide downhill is

783
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,538
is more the sort of part that's a bit of

784
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:57,178
a bummer it raises the question do you

785
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:59,700
think the current system will ever allow

786
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,559
for really high quality weed to exist or

787
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,600
just the scale at which you have to

788
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,639
operate to be able to exist in the legal

789
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,898
climate is like sort of prohibitive in a

790
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,720
sense

791
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,339
oh it will I don't have it necessarily a

792
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,640
time frame for it

793
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:17,099
but it absolutely will

794
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,000
um I have I have faith in that part of

795
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:21,898
it just simply because you know

796
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,700
um

797
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:25,259
I'll put it to you a different way like

798
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,659
uh

799
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:30,538
when I was younger

800
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:33,360
um it was basically hippies that were

801
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:35,278
interested in fully organic and a higher

802
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,778
grade of food right

803
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,359
um and there would be these very small

804
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:42,119
like crunchy like co-ops and stuff that

805
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,519
had Specialty Foods and organic apples

806
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:47,459
and this and that and everything else

807
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,259
and then what really made organic food

808
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,000
like available in America and every

809
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:52,619
grocery store and what blew up Whole

810
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,119
Foods and some of these big big

811
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,339
companies is

812
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,979
there was a bunch of wealthy people

813
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:00,898
that were like you know I'd drive a

814
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,000
European sports car and I have Italian

815
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:04,979
leather boots and I get my suits

816
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,298
tailored and I'm shopping at the same

817
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,519
grocery store

818
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,619
as everyone else isn't there a higher

819
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,658
grade of food I can buy isn't there

820
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:16,379
nicer stuff isn't there like a better

821
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:19,260
grade and there was and so it was really

822
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,200
like hippies sort of like

823
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:24,058
um coalesced organic and on a bunch of

824
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,159
like Back To Nature people and stuff but

825
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:29,220
it was sort of like a very Niche thing

826
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,620
for a while and then it went mainstream

827
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,538
and now you can get it in most most Big

828
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,839
Chain grocery stores have an organic

829
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:39,538
section you know some places uh you know

830
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,599
or large organic stores and I think the

831
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:44,099
same thing will happen with weed is that

832
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,658
right now we're just in that first

833
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:48,298
legalization where they're like okay

834
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:50,340
here you should just be happy you can

835
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:53,158
have it

836
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:54,839
right and the quality kind of sucks but

837
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,120
eventually what's going to happen is

838
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,759
quality is going to matter just like in

839
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,798
lots of other Industries and you're

840
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,619
gonna start to see people willing to pay

841
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:06,898
more for certain things but the market

842
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:08,879
is going to have to get educated on

843
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:11,939
what's important and I don't exactly

844
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,159
know how long that's going to take

845
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,960
um so I can't really say that it's like

846
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,899
around the corner or anything like that

847
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,419
but just looking at how other economic

848
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:24,538
stuff in America works I see no reason

849
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,820
why there shouldn't be everything from

850
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:29,339
kind of crappy weed but it's very

851
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:32,158
affordable for people and really

852
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:34,859
high-end stuff sativas stuff that yields

853
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,600
tiny stuff that but has a really great

854
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:38,939
effect and someone's willing to pay

855
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:41,398
through the nose

856
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,200
um for something that took 16 weeks and

857
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:46,319
didn't yield very much because it's that

858
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,298
good yeah certainly it's interesting

859
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,700
because it does raise this point that

860
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:52,558
I've spoken to a few people about but

861
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,019
notably I remember a conversation I had

862
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,398
with Bodhi where he sort of said you

863
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,278
know you do get a lot of people

864
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,778
especially online who will really throw

865
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,220
out their support for this sort of stuff

866
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:04,740
and say you know if you grow this

867
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,480
16-week plan I'll pay for it but you

868
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,280
know sadly you sort of find that when

869
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,079
push comes to shove and you've got the

870
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,599
product there and ready to take orders

871
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,480
you know the the Fanfare can sometimes

872
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,460
dry up a little bit and I think this is

873
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,079
not a new sentiment it exists in

874
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,300
probably a lot of Industries but like

875
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,279
hopefully you know eventually people do

876
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,960
really sort of um you know what is it

877
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,359
they pay with their wallet they vote

878
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,099
with their wallet and uh we can get some

879
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,440
of those sativas back especially with

880
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,359
the Advent of people like you know Tom

881
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,639
who wants to put out this you know

882
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,858
mythical Haze clone that he finds you

883
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,240
know maybe maybe that'll kick start it

884
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,779
all

885
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:46,138
I mean I will say that on an on a

886
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:48,960
negative note that I've never been more

887
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,240
worried about the diversity in weed than

888
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,440
I am right now

889
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:58,079
uh and that while I do think that those

890
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,940
kind of markets could develop over time

891
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,400
it's going to be really important for

892
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,760
people to hold on to as much of what

893
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,039
they have during this time that really

894
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,980
is rough for a lot of people

895
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:13,259
because before and you know and you know

896
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,719
that I have I have a pretty big

897
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,160
collection of of old strains that I like

898
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,419
right

899
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:22,139
and

900
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:24,000
you know I it's very idiosyncrate to me

901
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:25,679
because it's not like I had this idea

902
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,358
that like oh I'm just gonna hold on to

903
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,039
all this special stuff

904
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,019
and then one day it's going to be like

905
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,358
it's going to be rare and important or

906
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,338
whatever I basically just was willing to

907
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,559
because I lived in Mendo and I had space

908
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:40,380
I was like if I like this plant I'm

909
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,539
going to hold on to it right so the

910
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,619
collection is very much based upon my

911
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,679
preferences

912
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:48,300
and but that it's also expensive and

913
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:50,399
it's time consuming and it's a huge pain

914
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,740
in the ass so

915
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,079
it has to be funded by something

916
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,459
right and when times were a little

917
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,619
easier

918
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,000
some of these large Collections and some

919
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:01,500
of these various things and some of

920
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,300
these sativas you're talking about some

921
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,179
of the stuff that's unpopular

922
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,640
it has to survive

923
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:11,098
otherwise later on people might not have

924
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:15,000
access to it

925
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:18,059
you know because it you know it can't be

926
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,480
everybody else's responsibility to hold

927
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,980
on to stuff that's unpopular until it's

928
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,320
needed again

929
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,940
because that's how every conversation

930
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,760
you've ever had about what happened to

931
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,099
that strain comes up

932
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,280
um yeah roadkill skunk definitely jumps

933
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:38,579
to mind yeah you know in the 90s skunk

934
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,760
Terps were very were very prevalent

935
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:44,640
um and now that you know there's analogs

936
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,260
of it I think Sour Diesel and you know

937
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,838
there's various plants out there that

938
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,200
have elements of it but in the sense of

939
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:53,460
that pure rank like skunk spray

940
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,799
um it's kind of become a little bit of a

941
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,780
lost herp

942
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,619
um and like I was talking earlier on the

943
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,280
show

944
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:06,000
literally every indoor grower I knew uh

945
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,220
in 040506 ran some purple

946
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,559
when it was super popular and demand was

947
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:11,719
high and when it turned into Sour Diesel

948
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,639
Kush time

949
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:17,159
99.9 of the people dropped it and a few

950
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,980
people like CSI and a couple others here

951
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,539
and there a few rare people held it but

952
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,019
it went from everywhere to almost

953
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,019
nowhere

954
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:30,960
um and you know as you can well imagine

955
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:35,579
imagine having you know 40 moms

956
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,740
or 80 moms or 120 moms right

957
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:39,780
uh and trying to keep those things alive

958
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:42,239
and healthy

959
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,680
and cloning them and starting them over

960
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,179
and growing them up and getting them

961
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,559
healthy and then cloning them and

962
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,659
starting them over because obviously

963
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,940
they get too big and like what kind of

964
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:52,799
facility you probably should have

965
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,800
in order to like keep all this

966
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,460
incredibly important history and and and

967
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,339
you know uh DNA alive and mostly it's

968
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,280
being done in garages yeah yeah and it

969
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:07,739
does raise an interesting point because

970
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,660
the the question comes to mind like you

971
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:11,519
know how do you compensate someone for

972
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:13,319
that effort because when you sit down

973
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,900
and do the math on it a lot of physical

974
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,420
hours of Labor and then you know you can

975
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,838
factor in electricity costs mediums all

976
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,579
that sort of nutrient and not everyone's

977
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,679
necessarily a breeder you know not

978
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,500
everyone can necessarily just bang out a

979
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,299
seed line with these old strains and get

980
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,920
compensated for hanging on to them and

981
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,260
so it does sort of raise this question

982
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,619
of like how do you think as a community

983
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,660
we can thank the preservationists like

984
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,480
yourself who maybe don't have a seed

985
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:45,299
company or don't have one yet maybe and

986
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,338
uh how yeah what how can we pay them

987
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,099
back besides just you know a verbal

988
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:54,059
thank you which is obvious well I mean

989
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:57,480
the real issue for me is rather than

990
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:58,199
getting any kind of Praise or thanks you

991
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,119
know

992
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,618
uh the more important part would just be

993
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,358
making sure that a lot of these things

994
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,880
just stay alive

995
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,098
so that future like you know future

996
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,599
Generations can have them

997
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,460
I don't even necessarily mean future

998
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,200
Generations like 50 years from now I'm

999
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,820
talking like eight years from now five

1000
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,399
years from now yeah you know like

1001
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,579
because once it's gone it's gone

1002
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,260
and and as as I'm sure

1003
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,579
because you've talked to a lot of people

1004
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,380
by this point

1005
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,000
you know when you get into Kush and you

1006
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,380
get into Sour Diesel and you get into

1007
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,599
all these different things that maybe

1008
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,900
became popular in the 90s

1009
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,599
it's really hard to figure out even just

1010
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,358
20 years later exactly what happened

1011
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,640
or what cut is the right cut

1012
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,279
or which is this or that or whatever

1013
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:46,460
right so

1014
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,460
um

1015
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:51,539
I think that when when it comes down to

1016
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:54,239
it different people that are that are

1017
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:56,338
collectors figure out different ways to

1018
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,338
make money so they can keep the

1019
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:01,619
collection because what I think is it's

1020
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:03,599
it's mostly the people that hold on to

1021
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:06,720
things not entirely so but for the most

1022
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,559
part they do so out of love

1023
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:13,319
right yeah so you know and different

1024
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:16,259
people might love different things

1025
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,900
so they might be more inclined to hold

1026
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,119
on to these things than others

1027
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,260
right so you have to have like a diverse

1028
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,599
group of people like we were talking

1029
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,640
again about my buddy pack

1030
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,920
um he loved that train wreck and that

1031
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,259
blue dream enough that he's held him

1032
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,000
since he first got him in Humboldt a

1033
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,260
million years ago

1034
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,539
right

1035
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,579
or think of some people like Bodhi you

1036
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:40,679
were talking about that have some you

1037
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,180
know that have some rare sativas or some

1038
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:46,019
other friends that might have some rare

1039
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:48,719
indicas or you know CSI that has you

1040
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:50,338
know or myself or you know keep naming

1041
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,739
different folks but

1042
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:54,960
you know whether it's a seed company or

1043
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,239
whatever else a lot of these people they

1044
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,400
hold on to it at the core because they

1045
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,078
want to keep it alive

1046
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:05,039
and you end up sharing it with people

1047
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,900
that you also hope will keep it alive

1048
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,880
and that's the frustrating thing about

1049
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,800
trying to hold on to a collection is

1050
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,559
some of the stuff people will be like oh

1051
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,300
you're a hoarder and

1052
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,739
some of these things like the headband

1053
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,180
or different things I've shared with

1054
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,618
friends so many different times it's

1055
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:22,319
unbelievable

1056
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:25,440
but most people don't want to hold on to

1057
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,960
them unless it's like currently popular

1058
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,119
yeah right like everybody everybody

1059
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,858
wants fire Sour Diesel when sour

1060
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,559
Diesel's popular

1061
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:36,059
but what happens when you know like the

1062
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,799
market shifts to purple or the market

1063
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,779
shifts to this or the market shifts to

1064
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,160
that who's going to hold on to the thing

1065
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,960
that's unpopular

1066
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,539
and it's going to take up space and time

1067
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,960
in their growth and so it's not so much

1068
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:51,659
like um it's not so much the credit part

1069
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,940
that I give a [ __ ] about uh it's more

1070
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:55,920
about like

1071
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,139
um that that kind of stuff surviving

1072
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,420
because who wants to be in a world and

1073
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:03,059
this isn't a dis against gelato but who

1074
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,400
wants to be in a world where like 95 of

1075
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:08,279
the of the cuts are gelato cookies cush

1076
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,780
mints or you know some kind of popular

1077
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,820
thing within the last three or four

1078
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,200
years so you don't want to pigeonhole

1079
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,880
yourself

1080
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,559
well I mean and you know you even know

1081
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,079
like from like from a genetics

1082
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,578
perspective there could be stuff in some

1083
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,220
of these old strains that we don't even

1084
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,960
know how valuable it is for years

1085
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:26,639
there could be terpenes there could be

1086
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,858
there could be mold resistance there

1087
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,098
could be bug resistance there could be

1088
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:33,358
valuable stuff

1089
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:36,440
besides the fact that it's cool wheat

1090
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:40,380
and then you enjoy smoking it

1091
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,659
yeah definitely definitely I mean just

1092
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,820
sort of to relate back to a topic you

1093
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:47,940
just touched on like when we're talking

1094
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,940
about people who hold on to strains that

1095
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,338
are really special I do remember uh in

1096
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,400
one of the early must have been 2016

1097
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:58,559
Emerald cups I went to I got a nug of

1098
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
Trinity off you and I remembered

1099
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,759
distinctly when I when I smoked it

1100
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,980
thinking oh you know this is really

1101
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,780
interesting it's not like modern strains

1102
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,420
I just remember thinking it's very

1103
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,519
skunky and very hashy that was sort of

1104
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,740
the the lasting impression I got from it

1105
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,358
I'd love to hear your rundown on the

1106
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,000
Trinity and sort of the backstory from

1107
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,980
your perspective was it pretty leafy

1108
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,699
what I gave you yeah I think it might

1109
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,800
have been outdoor maybe yeah so that the

1110
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:27,358
Trinity is a pretty cool story

1111
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,300
um I'll leave out some names but the

1112
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:33,900
basic story is that there was a guy in

1113
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:38,099
the glass blowing scene from Eugene uh

1114
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:41,039
in Oregon area and he he traded some

1115
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,818
glass for some weed and

1116
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,420
um

1117
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:47,940
ended up they're finding finding seed

1118
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:50,400
and it popped and there's a there's a

1119
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:53,099
group up in up in Oregon that it sort of

1120
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,318
started to spread through and so when I

1121
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,640
first started coming out to the West

1122
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:59,159
Coast

1123
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,679
um as a you know as a hippie kid I would

1124
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:04,618
hit events like um Reggae on the River

1125
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:07,919
uh in Humboldt or I would go see you

1126
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:10,800
know Jerry band shows uh in the bay or

1127
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,260
you know I started going to see uh

1128
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,140
Oregon Country Fair right

1129
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,819
and Oregon Country Fair is

1130
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:19,858
um you know it's sort of like it

1131
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:22,380
definitely is a is in very old school

1132
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,759
hippie Gathering that goes on right

1133
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,160
outside of there and most of those

1134
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,839
people that are involved go and so I

1135
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,480
started making friends up there and most

1136
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:34,619
of my friends up there were growing

1137
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,858
things like the the snow the Trinity

1138
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,838
um a a different Super Skunk

1139
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:42,900
um you know some various

1140
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,400
various things of that nature and so it

1141
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,500
was kind of a strain I was familiar with

1142
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,059
because most of my like most of my

1143
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,679
friends that I was making up there then

1144
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:51,059
had it right

1145
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,578
and

1146
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:55,858
all we knew about it was it was bag seed

1147
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:57,300
from Trinity County in California

1148
00:44:55,858 --> 00:45:00,059
okay

1149
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:03,119
and then through a variety of situations

1150
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:06,420
that went on almost everybody lost it

1151
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,039
from the late 90s to the early 2000s

1152
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,318
and it was just one of those name

1153
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:13,380
strains that was just gone

1154
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,699
and I kept trying to find it and every

1155
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,200
time I found it and someone would give

1156
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:19,078
it to me I would grow it and it wouldn't

1157
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,519
be what I remember and people would be

1158
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,480
like and I'd have to tell them it's a

1159
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,358
fake

1160
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:28,019
so fast forward literally like 15 years

1161
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:30,900
or something 10 12 years whatever and we

1162
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:35,519
CSI and another friend I won't name up

1163
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:37,440
in Humboldt and a guy in Oregon maybe we

1164
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:42,000
stumbled upon this thing

1165
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,559
so I get it back and I grow it and I

1166
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,300
believe there was a there was a bad fire

1167
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,099
that year the first year I had it so

1168
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,660
that that those outdoor plants really

1169
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:51,780
went through hell

1170
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:53,399
uh and I had this jar and I started

1171
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,040
showing it to various friends of mine

1172
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,420
and everyone got real excited and

1173
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:58,739
thought it was it

1174
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,920
okay

1175
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:04,618
it's it it's back we have it oh my God I

1176
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,119
can't believe it it's back and then the

1177
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:08,280
next year I grew it and it didn't go

1178
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,200
through hell it didn't get beat up by

1179
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,480
the weather there was no fires and it

1180
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,000
came out way nicer and way chunkier in

1181
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,380
all honesty than the previous year and

1182
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,940
then about half of my friends that

1183
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,260
didn't jive with their memory anymore

1184
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,519
and they're like now I'm not sure it's

1185
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,859
it

1186
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:25,139
and so you have a group of people that

1187
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:27,000
some of them think it's absolutely it

1188
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:29,519
and then some of them think

1189
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,318
maybe it's it or maybe it's like an S1

1190
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,480
or maybe it's a close relative I can't

1191
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:37,079
say for sure right

1192
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,079
and what it goes to show in my mind is

1193
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,760
that even if you're even if you had

1194
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,859
something back in the day

1195
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,000
even if you grew it any number of times

1196
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:49,318
like how good is old memory

1197
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,420
right

1198
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,460
yeah and because you know you have this

1199
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,380
thing where it's like whether it's the

1200
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,760
you know how good is a 20 year old

1201
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,740
memory

1202
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,660
are you going to be able to identify

1203
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,059
something beyond a shadow of a doubt

1204
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:05,159
after multiple decades passed and let's

1205
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:06,838
be honest

1206
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,519
um when you had it you were in your

1207
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:10,739
early 20s and you were taking a bunch of

1208
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,900
psychedelics and you were you know a

1209
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:15,299
partying hippie and this and that and

1210
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,940
your skill set was way different and the

1211
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,280
growing style was probably different too

1212
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,900
and so I deal with this with a lot of

1213
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,940
cuts because people have gotten really

1214
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,700
interested into lineage

1215
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,920
and everyone wants to claim that they

1216
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,659
have the real deal old school

1217
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,818
and it becomes difficult to ascertain

1218
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:34,559
and people get into battles over whether

1219
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:36,779
or not it's real or whether or not it's

1220
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,299
close Trinity is an example of that

1221
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,660
because it sort of fell off the face

1222
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:45,359
of like people having it for a long time

1223
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:47,940
and sometimes those strains can just

1224
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,400
exist with one or two or three people in

1225
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,920
some little group that isn't online or

1226
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,980
isn't connected and so for the connected

1227
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,460
people something might be gone

1228
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:01,619
right yeah but you know it's kind of the

1229
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:05,039
same thing with like uh what happened

1230
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:07,318
with that with that A5 in Holland right

1231
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,519
where for a long time people thought it

1232
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:10,739
was lost

1233
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,079
and then they discovered that there was

1234
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:14,818
this guy that had these sativas that

1235
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,099
Neville had gave them

1236
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:21,179
and one of them ended up being that A5

1237
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:22,859
cut yeah but he just was tucked away

1238
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:26,338
doing his own thing

1239
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:29,219
right and the Trinity it seems like

1240
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:31,980
that's kind of the case with it where it

1241
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,480
kind of tucked away and it hid

1242
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,358
um and it wasn't being passed around

1243
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:40,440
very much and so I'm not gonna sit here

1244
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:43,619
and say it's 100 it because who am I to

1245
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,179
say so but I will say that even the

1246
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,579
people that think it's not it think it's

1247
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:50,338
a very close relative or an S1

1248
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:52,740
and I love the weed itself which is the

1249
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:55,858
most important part is actually liking

1250
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:57,899
the Cannabis itself yeah fully and

1251
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:00,239
admittedly I think I had heard someone

1252
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,460
say that uh they thought it might have

1253
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,899
been trinity cross blueberry and the

1254
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,838
thing that I thought when I heard that

1255
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:09,000
was what makes you say blueberry like as

1256
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:10,920
in like was there to your recollection

1257
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,559
was there a clone of trinity cross

1258
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,960
blueberry that also went around

1259
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:17,519
there there was there was some there was

1260
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,318
some accidental breedings with Trinity

1261
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,300
and there was a few intentional stuff

1262
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:25,440
that was done

1263
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:27,480
um you know and I I don't I can't really

1264
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,880
say about the original Trinity blueberry

1265
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,980
but I do have friends that lived up

1266
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,400
there then and said that they got it uh

1267
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,079
semi often so I do know that it existed

1268
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,200
um what it looked like and how close it

1269
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,720
was I couldn't say but I do think that

1270
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:46,199
that Trinity cut that exists I do think

1271
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,459
it's really tasty smoke it's oily in a

1272
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:49,439
weird way

1273
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,619
um it burns really nice it's got a

1274
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,539
really nice potent Buzz uh I would

1275
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:56,400
classify it as really good old school

1276
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:58,380
you know where maybe it's not as

1277
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,260
visually appealing you know for today's

1278
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:03,180
market but in terms of like uh how it

1279
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,240
burns and how it smokes and how it feels

1280
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:08,399
once you're smoking it I am a big fan

1281
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:09,779
yeah okay well look as a follow-up I'd

1282
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,858
love to ask you

1283
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:17,099
you often hear people say that the

1284
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:18,239
Humboldt snow could be a sister to the

1285
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,220
Trinity and I'd love to hear your

1286
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,318
thoughts on that because I have been

1287
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:24,419
lucky enough to try Humboldt snow many

1288
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,579
years ago some imported weed to

1289
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,838
Australia from what I believe and my

1290
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:29,880
experience was a very reputable

1291
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,259
Connection in the states so you know I

1292
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,200
don't have too much reason to doubt it

1293
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,599
wasn't real but from my memory it was a

1294
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:38,639
very different plant to the sort of nug

1295
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,079
of Trinity I got from you I'd love to

1296
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:41,519
hear your thoughts you know have you

1297
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,119
tried the Humboldt snow do you think

1298
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:48,300
there is any relation oh yeah I have it

1299
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,720
um so that's a good story

1300
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:54,539
it and it and it it really goes to show

1301
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:58,139
how different Crews can call things

1302
00:50:54,539 --> 00:51:00,599
different names okay because

1303
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,279
like I was saying before that same group

1304
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,619
of friends that I met at Oregon Country

1305
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,480
Fair that were growing the Trinity they

1306
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:11,460
also grew the snow

1307
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,980
okay and to them uh it was Eugene snow

1308
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:17,280
or organ snow

1309
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:19,079
right that's what they called it uh and

1310
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,800
to them it was from there

1311
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:25,140
so if you got it in Humboldt uh like CSI

1312
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,900
got it it was humble snow if you got it

1313
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:30,179
in Eugene it was probably Eugene snow

1314
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,800
um it actually I know the people

1315
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:34,440
um there was I won't say their names but

1316
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,460
there was a boyfriend girlfriend who

1317
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:41,460
drove out from Florida to Oregon with

1318
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,858
that cut in their car and in Florida it

1319
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:48,559
was called the skunk five

1320
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:51,779
so that cut has gone from skunk5 to snow

1321
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,559
Eugene snow Oregon snow and Humboldt

1322
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,300
snow

1323
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,040
just depending on who you got it from

1324
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,160
and where you got it and what era you

1325
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:00,420
got it in what a life it's lived yeah

1326
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,799
and it's just kind of one of those

1327
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,838
things where it's like I mean you can

1328
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,280
talk about there's a bunch of strains we

1329
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,380
don't need to get off on a big tangent

1330
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,059
but you know I'm sure some people back

1331
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,140
in the day called the puck the hash

1332
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,660
plant

1333
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:14,039
and some people then called it the puck

1334
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:15,539
and then some people called it the

1335
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:18,599
Skelly and then some people called it

1336
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:20,159
the Skelly hash plant right and so and

1337
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,960
you get different groups that'll argue

1338
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,519
with each other over like what's the

1339
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,619
name and what's the [ __ ] name that

1340
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:28,199
came later

1341
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:29,760
um but that's just because cannabis

1342
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,919
groups are kind of isolated from each

1343
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,599
other until the internet and the forums

1344
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,220
came around and so

1345
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,780
you know we're we're good at giving

1346
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,939
things nicknames

1347
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,680
and so sometimes names take a life of

1348
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,539
their own and if you got snow and

1349
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:44,098
Humboldt it was probably I mean I think

1350
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:45,659
CSI I can't remember and I'm gonna

1351
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:47,519
butcher it

1352
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:50,578
um but he would he would drive the snow

1353
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,900
up to Portland back in the day and they

1354
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:54,780
would take it as some totally different

1355
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:57,119
name I just I didn't mention like soup

1356
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,800
or something oh okay

1357
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,599
I'd have to ask him I don't want to

1358
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,000
misspeak because it's not popping into

1359
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:05,220
my head but it was it was like the guy

1360
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,300
that he gave it to sold it totally under

1361
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:08,159
some different name and it was

1362
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,800
incredibly popular under that name in

1363
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:15,779
the Portland area in the late 90s early

1364
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:18,240
2000s yeah wow so um it's definitely not

1365
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,980
related to the trinity

1366
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,618
the only thing that you can say that

1367
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,079
it's related from is it came from the

1368
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:27,358
same general

1369
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:30,480
smoking glass blowing Grateful Dead

1370
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:32,338
hippie circles in Oregon yeah okay

1371
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,318
that's the commonality that makes sense

1372
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:36,900
that makes sense that's the commonality

1373
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:39,358
that like it's spread from there so

1374
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:42,838
often people would would probably see

1375
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:46,259
people that had both yeah right but

1376
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:47,759
Trinity came from Trinity County and uh

1377
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,760
snow came from Florida

1378
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,700
huh there you go world's apart almost

1379
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,040
very yeah very different okay okay I

1380
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:57,838
wanted to to loop back to one more

1381
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:59,460
strain you mentioned earlier before we

1382
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,078
we've stopped lingering because I could

1383
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,699
honestly talk about these all day but

1384
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,920
you mentioned you got to try the

1385
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:07,439
shoreline skunk from uh high and

1386
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,920
Lonesome and I had grew out a shoreline

1387
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:13,440
skunk S1 many many years ago back when I

1388
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,639
was not very enlightened about cannabis

1389
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,559
at all I was just sort of you know

1390
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,838
stumbling my way through seed banks and

1391
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,460
uh this one was from the devil's Harvest

1392
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,739
crew and I've come to learn a bit more

1393
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,260
information about those guys as time has

1394
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:27,479
gone by and sort of you get mixed

1395
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:29,880
reviews about them sometimes uh negative

1396
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,159
but this plan I grew from them was very

1397
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,318
interesting it was it's truly one of the

1398
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,039
most memorable terpen profiles I've ever

1399
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:39,900
smelled a very metallic sort of skunk

1400
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,858
Aroma what's your thoughts on the

1401
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,539
shoreline do you think it's going to

1402
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:45,779
make a comeback and does the real clone

1403
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:48,838
have that sort of metallic aspect to it

1404
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:52,859
I think it has a bit of a metallic taste

1405
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:56,759
um I am definitely not the shoreline

1406
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:58,679
expert by any means uh because I am a

1407
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,880
very very I you know I only even really

1408
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:02,818
tried

1409
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,079
it recently to be honest

1410
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:05,219
um and that's kind of interesting

1411
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,200
because

1412
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:08,939
you know I you have a I have a wide

1413
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,159
variety of friends all over the country

1414
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,900
and in various places but it doesn't

1415
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,179
mean even though you might talk to them

1416
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,720
a lot about various stuff that you get

1417
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:20,578
to try all their weed all the time right

1418
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:23,338
uh and especially like for some of these

1419
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,539
clone holders or body or CSI or this or

1420
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:28,078
that it's not like these guys are

1421
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:30,179
growing out just rooms of head stash so

1422
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,680
that you can TR they have the real thing

1423
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:33,118
but like most of the time when they're

1424
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,558
growing it they're breeding with it or

1425
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,660
something like that so there's not only

1426
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,519
it's not like there's like plethora of

1427
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:41,699
flower floating around of all these

1428
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:44,358
Rarities all the time so

1429
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:47,338
um Shoreline seems to come out of Texas

1430
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:49,440
and it's spread around it's very much

1431
00:55:47,338 --> 00:55:51,539
90s weed and that just the way that it

1432
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,639
looks it definitely seems like it has

1433
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:56,039
some kind of skunk with something else

1434
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:58,199
in it aspect

1435
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:00,058
um and it's one of those things that

1436
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:01,799
it's been something that high and

1437
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,420
Lonesome has held on to for a long time

1438
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,760
and he sort of spread it around our

1439
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,420
friend group a bit

1440
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,760
and

1441
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,900
um it people really like it it's it's

1442
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,300
different

1443
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:15,358
uh one of the aspects that that happened

1444
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:17,400
in the last 15 years is that all these

1445
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,199
things that happened in terms of

1446
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,460
popularity every time a strain got

1447
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,098
popular

1448
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:26,039
everyone crossed everything to it

1449
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:27,660
right so there's a lot of OG there's a

1450
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:29,159
lot of stuff that has OG in it there's a

1451
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:30,960
lot of stuff that has cookie in it

1452
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:34,379
there's a lot of stuff that has Skittles

1453
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,079
or cushments or you know or sour or or

1454
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,720
Diesels or this or that or whatever

1455
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:42,599
but some of these older things that had

1456
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:44,879
their Heyday before that mixing they

1457
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,579
sort of stand alone and they give you a

1458
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,858
really good idea of how diverse weed

1459
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:51,960
used to be

1460
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:54,779
right

1461
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,480
um because before like the internet and

1462
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,760
before popularity and before like waves

1463
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,579
of stuff started happening there used to

1464
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,880
be a lot less weed and so almost all

1465
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:09,420
weeds sold which meant that a lot of

1466
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:13,019
diverse and nice weed would stick around

1467
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:14,639
most named clones have been really bad

1468
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:17,159
for diversity

1469
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,779
I will say yeah that's an interesting

1470
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,179
take I like that

1471
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,619
because what happens is it's like I know

1472
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:24,118
and I'll go back to like I've talked

1473
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:26,880
about it a bunch but I'll go back to

1474
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:29,338
like let's say it's o4 and you're having

1475
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,079
a hard time selling your ends and your

1476
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:33,358
neighbor is like dude I've got this

1477
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:35,960
purple Urkle and I swear to God if I

1478
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,699
give you cuts my guy will take every bit

1479
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,220
that you have

1480
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:42,539
and so that guy stops growing what he

1481
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:44,338
was growing and he grows the Urkel

1482
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:46,259
because it's easy

1483
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:48,420
and that works

1484
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:51,180
right and then

1485
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,980
Urkel's lessons in popularity and Sour

1486
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:55,679
Diesel becomes big and so that guy gets

1487
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,838
Sour Diesel and drops the Urkel

1488
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,699
and then he finds out that cush is going

1489
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,019
for crazy digits and he gets a cush and

1490
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:02,338
he drops the diesel and he grows some

1491
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,380
kush

1492
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:06,779
and so on and so forth and but what was

1493
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,358
that guy growing before the purple Urkel

1494
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,519
you see what I'm saying yeah yeah fully

1495
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:14,159
it's uh it's sort of an endless cycle

1496
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:17,219
isn't it so it's so what's happened in

1497
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:19,098
the last say 20 15 or 20 years as name

1498
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:21,659
strains have become really popular

1499
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:23,400
they've dominated what people breed with

1500
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:25,440
and they've dominated what's been on the

1501
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,019
market so a lot of times it ends up

1502
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,240
being the same 30 to 40 Cuts all Blended

1503
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:31,980
together in these different ways and

1504
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,500
things like Trinity and things like snow

1505
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,780
and things like Shoreline that we just

1506
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,539
mentioned or you know they all tie back

1507
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,220
to that previous era before that really

1508
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:44,279
started happening

1509
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:45,419
and so as a result of that you can see a

1510
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,180
lot of things that have a certain

1511
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:49,858
sameness to them and then you go back to

1512
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:51,419
before that started happening and you're

1513
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:53,159
like oh man that's Shoreline it's got a

1514
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,659
different thing to it it's got a

1515
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:57,420
different Buzz it's got this different

1516
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:59,818
kind of flavor profile that's neat and I

1517
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,559
think that so there's been positives to

1518
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:04,199
like popularity but there's also

1519
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:05,760
negatives as far as diversity goes wow

1520
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,259
that's really interesting I mean I was

1521
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,819
going to ask you this question later but

1522
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,460
it feels like it's a good spot to sort

1523
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:14,159
of put it in but I wanted to sort of get

1524
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:15,780
you a take on like how do you how do you

1525
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:19,318
sort of reconcile the differences

1526
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:21,119
between current popularity versus older

1527
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:22,739
popularity and I guess I'm thinking

1528
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,420
specifically in terms of like the

1529
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:28,500
Zeitgeist and maybe to give you an

1530
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:31,019
example let's say in the early 2000s c99

1531
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,780
nl5 Haze were being grown by everyone

1532
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:36,000
super super popular strains but if you

1533
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,099
talk to people nowadays about like

1534
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,500
what's the real heady strands from back

1535
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:43,079
then they wish they had they they rarely

1536
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:45,480
ever mention any of those two and it's

1537
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:48,180
you know maybe things like the park and

1538
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,880
things that weren't necessarily the The

1539
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:53,219
Talk of the Town at the time but

1540
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,019
retrospectively we're really interested

1541
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:56,939
in them and so I guess I'm wondering you

1542
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:58,679
know do you think if we look at the

1543
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,798
current situation the current popular

1544
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:03,960
Australians you know is is cushman's is

1545
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:06,119
Skittles do you think in 10 20 years

1546
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,338
time people will be looking back being

1547
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,980
like man I wish I had them or will it be

1548
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:14,039
some more Niche thing that maybe flies a

1549
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,920
bit under the radar at the moment

1550
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:18,719
yeah you know it's I mean it's always

1551
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,639
hard to predict the future but I can

1552
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,739
talk a bit about the differences because

1553
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,539
they are real

1554
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:26,338
um so

1555
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:29,579
back in the day

1556
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:31,259
uh in the 90s or in the early 2000s or

1557
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:33,960
you know maybe even through like before

1558
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,220
Instagram and social media really really

1559
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,220
kicked off

1560
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:41,098
I would say that you know most of the

1561
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:43,919
what we would call Elite okay

1562
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:47,760
it's not like everyone thought it was

1563
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:51,599
Elite it's just that like enough people

1564
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,839
enjoyed it that it gained a reputation

1565
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,640
does that make sense yeah so so like

1566
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:58,679
most Elites whether they whether you

1567
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,900
want to call whether the puck or the nl5

1568
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:04,440
haze or the what we would call the chem

1569
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:07,920
91 these days uh or the Kush or Sour

1570
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,420
Diesel they gained popularity they

1571
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,700
gained a group of people that thought it

1572
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,380
was amazing and then that started to

1573
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:14,759
spread and then the more it spread more

1574
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,260
people agreed with them and then it

1575
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,160
became desirable

1576
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:22,079
and then so most Elites happened

1577
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:23,399
organically

1578
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,140
right

1579
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,720
where today

1580
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:31,199
modern marketing has very much so hit

1581
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:34,199
cannabis there was no burner in the 90s

1582
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:36,058
right there was no that you know and and

1583
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:37,318
what I mean by that is like there was no

1584
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,940
hype people

1585
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:41,338
there there was no professional

1586
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,858
photographers like making the weed look

1587
01:01:41,338 --> 01:01:46,019
incredible with perfect lighting you

1588
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:48,598
know and rotating the bud on this thing

1589
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:51,119
and you so you can see now where now

1590
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:54,180
that you have legal cannabis everybody

1591
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,980
needs Elites and everybody needs fire

1592
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:58,679
right they're trying to sell you

1593
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:00,298
something so as a result of that you

1594
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:01,798
have a bunch of people pushing a bunch

1595
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:03,239
of things that they want to be elite

1596
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:05,940
because they want to make new money and

1597
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:08,039
they want it to be new hype right

1598
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,740
but it's because it's not being

1599
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:12,420
developed really organically a lot of

1600
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:14,759
them don't have the staying power that

1601
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,559
the ones of old do

1602
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:20,220
right

1603
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:22,019
imagine you know uh and so I think a lot

1604
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:24,298
of those old Elites they they've said

1605
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:27,659
you know they stood the test of time

1606
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:30,539
uh and but even even still some of them

1607
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:33,539
like some of the older ones like

1608
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:35,659
I think maybe their best use is breeding

1609
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:39,358
material these days

1610
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:41,578
uh I you know I am not even a fan of

1611
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,159
everything that's old right like I think

1612
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:47,099
the the Puck's children

1613
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:48,960
are and grandchildren are on average

1614
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:50,818
quite a bit nicer than the puck itself

1615
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,920
sure

1616
01:02:50,818 --> 01:02:55,440
I think the puck is valuable because it

1617
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,139
comes from the 80s and so whatever the

1618
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,318
genetics are that tie into that ties

1619
01:02:58,139 --> 01:03:02,699
into a very like

1620
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,259
pre-pre-era of cannabis

1621
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:05,759
you know

1622
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,920
um and I think that's important to like

1623
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,799
put into modern genes and spread that

1624
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,318
around and keep that DNA going

1625
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:15,659
um but you know it wouldn't it wouldn't

1626
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:18,358
be in my jar of favorites

1627
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:19,798
uh not even though I think that some of

1628
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:21,179
the hybrids that have been made with it

1629
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:23,818
are really nice

1630
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:25,980
yeah let me let me quickly jump in and

1631
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:27,358
digress for just two seconds

1632
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,639
people are going to kill me if I don't

1633
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:32,578
ask which of the park hybrids would you

1634
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:34,920
be into like Puck meets New World Indica

1635
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:36,900
meets new sativa like what's the general

1636
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,760
combination that would pick your

1637
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,599
curiosity

1638
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:44,880
I mean I you know I I think

1639
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:47,220
I think blending Puck into different

1640
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,960
indicas and then using those in whatever

1641
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,699
way you want is probably the best way to

1642
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,119
go

1643
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:56,159
um you know the puck is I mean compared

1644
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:57,720
to most modern things I you probably

1645
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,779
agree with this the puck is pretty ugly

1646
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:03,298
yeah and hard to grow

1647
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,760
it's hard to grow it's old it's ugly

1648
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:08,579
it's not very frosty it doesn't visually

1649
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,819
have what most people like

1650
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:14,039
um I had it for me it's basically like I

1651
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:15,960
would consider it like an indoor strain

1652
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:18,358
uh it doesn't like being out it doesn't

1653
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,039
like the sun very much the only time I

1654
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:23,098
was able to get it to do well in the sun

1655
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:24,838
is if I shaded it uh even more so than

1656
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:25,619
like in a greenhouse I had to shade it

1657
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:27,000
again

1658
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:29,818
you know

1659
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,179
um but you know if it's from the late

1660
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:35,420
80s like whatever genetics like I said

1661
01:04:33,179 --> 01:04:37,259
it ties to those genetics are worth

1662
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:40,200
keeping around

1663
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,880
and spreading into things and so you

1664
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:44,338
know there's various people that have

1665
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,838
done some work with the puck but it that

1666
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:48,239
kind of thing is a little bit of a labor

1667
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:50,099
of love because you know cookies and

1668
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,078
some of these different things like the

1669
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:54,298
puck doesn't have most of what the

1670
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,640
modern consumer wants in weed and it's

1671
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:58,318
it's slow growing and it's ugly so it's

1672
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,639
not like even people you know that have

1673
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,798
it it's not like those people are

1674
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:05,940
bumping out rooms of puck

1675
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:08,280
yeah yeah that's that's correct right so

1676
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,720
most people don't have access to it so

1677
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,980
it's good that they're it's being bred

1678
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:12,959
with

1679
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:15,780
um because I because like I said before

1680
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,858
who knows how important the genes in it

1681
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,540
are

1682
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:21,358
um and it definitely ties you know

1683
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:23,639
before kush before Sour Diesel before

1684
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:25,259
cookie before a lot of these things so

1685
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:27,960
it's important to keep some of those old

1686
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:29,940
genes percolating around

1687
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,099
um but if I was gonna go for some old

1688
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:35,579
school like 80s weed

1689
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:37,740
I think the nl5 hazes that have existed

1690
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:40,920
from that era are way nicer pot as far

1691
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:42,659
as like my personal smoke than Puck yeah

1692
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,039
look I have to agree with you and and

1693
01:05:42,659 --> 01:05:45,539
now that you've said it it makes me

1694
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,980
realize you know it's very rare that

1695
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:48,659
someone actually has a bud of the puck

1696
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,579
to offer me you know and I'll probably

1697
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:52,318
more often been offered a hybrid which

1698
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:55,619
makes sense given everything we just

1699
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:57,298
said and you just mentioned nl5 Haze I

1700
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:59,700
wanted to ask you you know a lot of

1701
01:05:57,298 --> 01:06:03,420
people have been talking specifically in

1702
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:06,179
the context of you about the uh pnw dog

1703
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:08,220
[ __ ] do you think it's nano5 Haze give

1704
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:10,798
us the lowdown on it

1705
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,858
so I'll give you the the brief history

1706
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:16,139
that I know and that this is funny too

1707
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:18,179
because you know when I when I do my

1708
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:20,699
when I do the chats or whatever

1709
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:23,039
I try really hard to talk about what I

1710
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:25,798
think I know and then like what's my

1711
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:28,139
personal subjective opinion

1712
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:29,460
and sometimes that opinion gets people

1713
01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:32,460
so upset

1714
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:34,619
right uh because people are married to

1715
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,659
certain stories or whatever and and and

1716
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:38,338
talking about weed and talking about

1717
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,379
history

1718
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:46,199
um can be a little dicey in that regard

1719
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:49,920
right so I used to think that the uh the

1720
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:52,078
dog [ __ ] was an old nl5 Haze variety

1721
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,579
from the early 90s and the reason why I

1722
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,099
thought that was basically the way it

1723
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:57,119
made me feel and the way it smelled and

1724
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:59,099
tasted

1725
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,140
okay

1726
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:04,079
um the history of it is a little muddled

1727
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:08,519
but it seems like it came in the early

1728
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:10,500
90s uh it popped up in Minneapolis or

1729
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:11,699
Northern Minnesota

1730
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,739
um and and it was called Electric

1731
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:17,279
Boogaloo

1732
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:19,858
um and then it got brought out to uh

1733
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,480
Oregon and it got changed and I don't

1734
01:07:19,858 --> 01:07:24,358
want to be misquoted here but I believe

1735
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,039
there was a guy that had it that had the

1736
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:28,199
cat piss

1737
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,880
and so he decided that the two strains

1738
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:31,879
he was going to have was the cat piss on

1739
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,280
the dog [ __ ]

1740
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:37,200
so he changes he changes the name from

1741
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,599
Electric Boogaloo to and I think even

1742
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:41,399
before Electric Boogaloo uh my buddy was

1743
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,400
telling me that at first they just

1744
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,099
called it the sativa

1745
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:52,858
right so it might have gone from the

1746
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:55,920
sativa to Electric Boogaloo to uh dog

1747
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:57,960
[ __ ] and I'll say for the record that

1748
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,318
Electric Boogaloo is one of my all-time

1749
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:03,298
favorite cannabis names yeah definitely

1750
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:05,818
uh I I personally think it's like that's

1751
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:09,420
like it's just an amazing amazingly cool

1752
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:11,338
name uh so and I and I definitely

1753
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,559
dislike and you would never ever in a

1754
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,838
million years in modern modern weed name

1755
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:18,719
something the dog [ __ ] uh because we're

1756
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:22,559
in like the dessert uh evoke images era

1757
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:25,739
but anyway it ended up I think by 93 94

1758
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:28,620
95-ish it ended up in Oregon in select

1759
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:31,439
groups and it's got its name got changed

1760
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:33,778
to dog [ __ ] and most people that have it

1761
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,639
have it through those connections and so

1762
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:40,560
dog [ __ ] it became

1763
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:43,020
and I have changed my mind on what I

1764
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,880
think the dog [ __ ] is and I'll throw it

1765
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:47,640
out there that this is absolutely pure

1766
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,798
speculation for me and has zero proof by

1767
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,060
any means so take it for what you will

1768
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:56,399
but

1769
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:58,500
it is to me a lot prettier than any nl5

1770
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,738
Haze Fino I've seen

1771
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,420
sure uh and you know nl5 Haze to me is

1772
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:06,059
like the most successful hybrid ever

1773
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:09,000
made and there's probably eight or ten

1774
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:13,380
living examples of it even still today

1775
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,319
from the early 90s right yeah a5s and

1776
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:18,420
c5s and there's piff and there's you

1777
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,699
know the black the the black what some

1778
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,199
people call Cuban black uh there's a lot

1779
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,479
of different phenos of it so there's a

1780
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:27,659
lot of there's the cough uh from

1781
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:29,519
Connecticut that ended up in Colorado so

1782
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:31,019
we're blessed in that regard that

1783
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,420
there's a bunch of them and they're all

1784
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:36,299
to some degree kinda ugly

1785
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:39,000
grown well the

1786
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:41,399
the dog [ __ ] is beautiful and so I have

1787
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,880
this sneaking suspicion because the only

1788
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:47,338
two things that Neville sold in that era

1789
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,039
which is the late 80s and early 90s and

1790
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:52,798
then at Scentsy that had Haze in it

1791
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:55,619
consistently was silver Pearl by Hayes

1792
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:59,100
and nl5 Haze

1793
01:09:55,619 --> 01:10:01,979
and I have been leaning towards maybe

1794
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:04,560
the it could have some it could be some

1795
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:06,479
silver it could be some silver haze yeah

1796
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,960
I mean that makes sense right like the

1797
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:12,059
photos pif posts of the Pearl he's got

1798
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,760
that they look really pretty

1799
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:17,100
yeah and so you know silver Pearl for

1800
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:21,000
people that don't know is the nl5 cut

1801
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:23,280
cross to early Pearl and and skunk yeah

1802
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,198
that's what that's what silver Pearl is

1803
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:28,198
and then Neville took that and crossed

1804
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:29,819
that to the same male of Hayes that nl5

1805
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:33,059
got crossed to and those were his two

1806
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:36,960
Haze offerings both at the seed bank and

1807
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:39,360
at Scentsy they were both sold for years

1808
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,739
um so it fits the timeline and I

1809
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,158
honestly like looking at all those

1810
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:45,959
straight nl5 Haze f1s like they just

1811
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,000
look a little uglier and a little weird

1812
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:52,020
and maybe that early Pearl and that

1813
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,840
skunk makes the the uh

1814
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,640
the you know the dog [ __ ] look prettier

1815
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,319
and it's certainly a little faster than

1816
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,300
some of those other hazes

1817
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,519
but I still get the effect and I still

1818
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,579
get a very similar nose to what I

1819
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:08,219
consider nl5 Haze to be

1820
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:11,399
um it's just much nicer looking weed and

1821
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:13,198
it's a little faster yeah I love it it's

1822
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:16,319
a great sativa it's one of my favorites

1823
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:17,460
I really enjoy the dog [ __ ] a whole

1824
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:19,920
bunch

1825
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:22,739
uh and I will say that

1826
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,260
um my buddy uh Bittersweet

1827
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:26,819
um who I should mention uh the shoreline

1828
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,560
that I smoked at that party was actually

1829
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:31,319
from him even though it was through high

1830
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,580
and Lonesome uh he grew it he also

1831
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:35,460
brought some

1832
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:37,079
um some Electric Boogaloo uh and it was

1833
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:40,679
a party favorite

1834
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:43,859
uh most people that you know most heads

1835
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:46,920
when they smoke it they really like it

1836
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:49,198
uh it tends to be a fan favorite

1837
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,880
so

1838
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,639
um it's it's an it's a nice strain it

1839
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,500
takes 12 weeks 13 weeks maybe something

1840
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,420
along those lines

1841
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,760
um but it it makes nice it makes nice

1842
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:03,239
flower it smells really good it's got a

1843
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,100
really good uplifting energetic uh Buzz

1844
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:06,599
makes you happy

1845
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,760
um it's pretty I almost call it like

1846
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,500
like old school 90s weed in the sense

1847
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,480
that it's it's like if you grow it right

1848
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,479
it's very lime green

1849
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:17,759
with uh this Certain Shade of hairs that

1850
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:19,619
just reminds me of getting like 90s

1851
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,300
Hydro Hydra what I used to call hydro

1852
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:23,279
weed

1853
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,539
um it's got just this very cool old

1854
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:27,599
school look

1855
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:31,439
uh it's it's an old favorite of mine and

1856
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:33,239
uh I I would love for that one to become

1857
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:36,719
um ragingly popular because I think it

1858
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:40,439
deserves it yeah yeah hugely even even

1859
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:42,779
just to to represent uh the sativa sort

1860
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,279
of side of the market a bit more I'd say

1861
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:46,380
it's cool and I have to admit I've never

1862
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:48,899
tried it you've uh You've Really Got Me

1863
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:51,840
Keen so there you go I'll have to I have

1864
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:54,299
to keep my ears and my eyes open for it

1865
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,039
it's a it's a manageable sativa that

1866
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,719
yields nice that yields nice looking

1867
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:59,519
nuggets

1868
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:01,319
um it doesn't take I mean it takes like

1869
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,480
I said 12 13 weeks but that's not

1870
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:06,179
forever

1871
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:08,879
uh you know so it uh it's really

1872
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:11,460
accessible and yeah most of my friends

1873
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,219
that have grown in or tried it uh it's

1874
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:16,319
become in their favorites too so I think

1875
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:18,179
it's one of those ones that could be a

1876
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:20,759
lot more popular than it is if people

1877
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:22,980
had access to it yeah beautiful stuff

1878
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,840
I'm gonna look for some hybrids I was

1879
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:26,399
meant to ask you this uh last question

1880
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,260
but you know we're still sort of in that

1881
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:30,179
General talking point but we were

1882
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,159
talking about you know the park and the

1883
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:34,199
utility of like having those older World

1884
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,658
genetics being incorporated into modern

1885
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:39,119
stuff and I've seen even some of the the

1886
01:13:36,658 --> 01:13:40,439
more hype guys talking about trying to

1887
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,019
make some hybrids like you know I'm

1888
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:44,579
talking like connected California and uh

1889
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,440
you know Chris compound I swear I've

1890
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:48,779
seen them talk about the dog [ __ ] so

1891
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:51,178
maybe that'll work at 2AM but what I

1892
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:53,880
wanted to ask you specifically was

1893
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:56,579
I've been really excited by seeing some

1894
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:58,679
of the work being done by full power

1895
01:13:56,579 --> 01:14:01,738
selections and the whole crew that Iris

1896
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:03,359
in is behind and working with and some

1897
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:05,698
of the stuff they've been posting about

1898
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:08,939
collecting from Afghanistan Pakistan

1899
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:11,099
India looks really phenomenal and I

1900
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:13,919
wonder do you think these modern

1901
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,560
afghanis will be able to inject some

1902
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,239
fresh blood into the genetics in the way

1903
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,039
that say the puck did or do you think

1904
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:21,839
that it's like it's just not the same

1905
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:26,279
and even though it might look old world

1906
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,360
it's maybe not quite oh absolutely 100 I

1907
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:32,340
mean

1908
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:34,619
so I could throw a couple uh you know

1909
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:39,719
let's put it this way

1910
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:42,238
in a world where everything is GMO

1911
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:44,640
cushman's gelato Skittles

1912
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:46,559
and combinate and Kush and combinations

1913
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,480
thereof right

1914
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:51,120
adding in genetics that are totally

1915
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:53,158
different than that is very beneficial

1916
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,658
right

1917
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:55,559
um You don't want to get too inbred on

1918
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:58,500
things

1919
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:01,260
now working with land races

1920
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:03,179
it can be beneficial but it's not going

1921
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:05,159
to be universally beneficial a lot of

1922
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:07,199
it's going to suck and that's just part

1923
01:15:05,158 --> 01:15:10,139
of breeding and P the part that people

1924
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:12,839
don't want to accept is that breeding is

1925
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,420
a lot of failure right one of the most

1926
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,900
common things that happen to people in

1927
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:21,300
the 80s when they first started breeding

1928
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:23,579
sativa's uh and indicas together on a

1929
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,619
more consistent basis was that they

1930
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:27,779
realized that a lot of these indicas

1931
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:31,679
that come from like this extremely dry

1932
01:15:27,779 --> 01:15:34,380
arid cool climate in Afghanistan rotted

1933
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,779
like crazy when

1934
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:40,440
bred into sativas

1935
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:42,479
and so one of the reasons why like

1936
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:45,419
certain cuttings and certain lines

1937
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:48,299
became so prevalent in 80s and 90s

1938
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,859
cannabis uh for indicas was because it

1939
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,820
was actually really difficult for those

1940
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:57,719
Old-Timers to find indicas that didn't

1941
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:59,519
screw up what they had right so

1942
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,260
it's there's a good thing and that it's

1943
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,719
totally different genetics

1944
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:05,400
but when you work with land races

1945
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:08,880
whether it's sativa or indica from

1946
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:12,179
anywhere it's a lot of work to in at

1947
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:16,140
times to get them to a level

1948
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:17,219
that would be acceptable to us right

1949
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:19,199
um and then the other thing you got to

1950
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:21,239
remember about these indicas is that it

1951
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:23,339
took us some time because

1952
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:25,919
you know sativas are made to be smoked

1953
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:27,600
for the most part right

1954
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,399
um and the cultures we were getting it

1955
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,039
from were growing it for smoke whether

1956
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:34,619
it was Mexican or Colombian or Thai or

1957
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:36,420
whatever but most of these indicas that

1958
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:38,158
are coming from say some of these groups

1959
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:40,020
in Afghanistan and Pakistan that are

1960
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:42,179
collecting them

1961
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:43,440
um the plant itself is just the carrier

1962
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:45,960
for the hash

1963
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:47,819
it's just the carrier for the resin

1964
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,619
and they're and they're resin Farmers

1965
01:16:47,819 --> 01:16:51,599
right they don't care what it smokes

1966
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:54,479
like they don't care what the flour

1967
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,760
tastes like or how it burns

1968
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:58,559
um they're there to grow that plant and

1969
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,780
then to extract the resin off it and to

1970
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,800
turn it into various kinds of hash

1971
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:07,500
you know and so for for us who are

1972
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,420
primarily flower smokers

1973
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,460
um we're gonna have to convert that into

1974
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:13,560
our needs

1975
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,880
you see what I'm saying yeah like they

1976
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,699
don't know if they don't know if the

1977
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,619
flower tastes like [ __ ] true

1978
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:21,479
and if they're growing it in the Hindu

1979
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:23,698
Kush mountains and it's bone dry there

1980
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:25,799
and it's arid and you take it to

1981
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:27,658
California or Oregon or somewhere where

1982
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,760
it's more humid and it rots like crazy

1983
01:17:27,658 --> 01:17:32,819
you wouldn't even see that in

1984
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,199
Afghanistan so I think it's valuable

1985
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:37,500
what they're doing

1986
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:40,319
because for the most part with 20 years

1987
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:43,439
or or more of war going on over there

1988
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:45,119
than involved Americans Afghanistan and

1989
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,519
Pakistan have been sort of kind of like

1990
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:49,019
cut off for quite a while

1991
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,699
right

1992
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:53,159
um there was people that went there in

1993
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:55,439
the set like um like Neville did and the

1994
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:58,079
and the dronkers and and Sam Skunk Man

1995
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:01,859
there was people that went in the in the

1996
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:05,698
70s on the hippie hashish Trail

1997
01:18:01,859 --> 01:18:08,279
um and then you know once once once the

1998
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:10,259
wars got really crazy and extended

1999
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:12,420
you know that kind of the world is has

2000
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:15,539
been a little bit cut off

2001
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:17,460
if you could say right and that that

2002
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:20,760
actually might have saved it you know I

2003
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:22,739
was we were talking to on uh one of the

2004
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,539
podcasts that Matt and I did with uh

2005
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:26,519
this guy from Canada from Federation

2006
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:29,460
seeds oh yeah

2007
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:33,179
and he he was talking about how he spent

2008
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:34,800
10 years in uh in Spain or maybe eight

2009
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:36,840
years but a long time a significant

2010
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,279
chunk of time in Spain and in his

2011
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,260
opinion

2012
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:42,179
um there's almost no Moroccan weed left

2013
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:43,739
in Morocco

2014
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:45,480
um it's all

2015
01:18:43,738 --> 01:18:48,419
Dutch wheat

2016
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:51,658
it's all super silver haze and then meat

2017
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:54,239
and Amnesia Haze and tangy and various

2018
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:56,939
things like that and it's close enough

2019
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:58,259
to Spain that all this genetics started

2020
01:18:56,939 --> 01:19:00,238
going over there and people started

2021
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:02,520
saying hey I'll pay more money

2022
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:03,839
for this this stuff turn this into hash

2023
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,300
for us

2024
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,219
and he told me that they've had friends

2025
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,619
going over there that have connections

2026
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:12,960
that are Smugglers asking like the

2027
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:15,300
mountain villagers and like the the

2028
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,239
tribal people like where's the old

2029
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,679
Moroccan hash strains and they can't

2030
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:24,359
even find them

2031
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,980
um right yeah so it might be good if I

2032
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:27,960
don't I don't want to say war is good

2033
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:30,000
because obviously like it's terrible for

2034
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:33,060
the people involved but in terms of

2035
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,658
preserving the genetics of Pakistan and

2036
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,659
Afghanistan

2037
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:40,980
um that might have helped

2038
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,960
they haven't been invaded by Dutch

2039
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:44,579
genetics they haven't been like even in

2040
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,340
I mean I've talked to people where they

2041
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:49,260
say that like even by the late 90s

2042
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,800
um most of the Jamaican weed gave Wade

2043
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:56,219
from Pure Jamaican into like white widow

2044
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,420
and blueberry and Dutch hybrids

2045
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:58,859
right

2046
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:00,779
um because they just wanted shorter

2047
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:02,519
faster quicker easier things to grow

2048
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:05,219
that were more marketable for the market

2049
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:08,219
they were going to which was America

2050
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:10,500
so I I do think that there's a lot of

2051
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:12,359
scrolling back to what you were saying I

2052
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,698
do think there's positive stuff to these

2053
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:16,679
people going around going to these

2054
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:18,019
traditional farmers in Afghanistan and

2055
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:21,119
Pakistan and the different regions

2056
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:23,699
collecting and preserving their seeds I

2057
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,738
do think that's super important uh I

2058
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:28,678
think it'll probably take some time and

2059
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:30,359
some effort and some energy uh

2060
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:32,340
you know for instance I have a buddy of

2061
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:34,559
mine who I won't shout out on the thing

2062
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,719
but I have a buddy of mine that

2063
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,159
um has what he calls uh this Kandahar

2064
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,020
okay

2065
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:41,519
and

2066
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:43,440
um he has a friend of his that was in

2067
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,239
the military and was over in Afghanistan

2068
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:48,000
and ended up making friends with

2069
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:51,178
villagers and he brought back a bunch of

2070
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:54,238
seed and gave it to his mom who gave it

2071
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:56,460
to my friend right and so he's breeding

2072
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:59,459
with this Kandahar now which is total

2073
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,960
land race from Afghanistan you know uh

2074
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,060
who knows how many generations of

2075
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,279
farmers it goes back and so far

2076
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:08,280
everything he breeds it to it harms like

2077
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:10,979
crazy oh so

2078
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:12,840
um it just goes to show that like taming

2079
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:15,299
some land races

2080
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,640
you know and and getting what you want

2081
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,320
out of them is more work than a lot of

2082
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,239
breeders are willing to do

2083
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:23,579
but I do think it's cool that there's a

2084
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:25,259
whole hash culture over there and so

2085
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:27,359
there's a whole ecosystem that is

2086
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,640
supporting a lot of those traditional

2087
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:33,119
genetics in that part of the world

2088
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:36,000
yeah wholeheartedly I really love to see

2089
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:38,279
that uh irizon and the crew are trying

2090
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,840
to get some money back in the hands of

2091
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:41,399
you know the guys who have preserved the

2092
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,340
land races for years because something

2093
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:47,158
that is very much lasted with me was a

2094
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,199
comment he made about how you know you

2095
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:51,899
sometimes see modern breeders getting up

2096
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:53,879
in arms about people breeding with their

2097
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:56,279
stuff and I think a notable example of

2098
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:58,560
that is uh Fletcher from archive has

2099
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:00,479
been on the record of being not thrilled

2100
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,940
with some people breeding with dosey doe

2101
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:05,279
males and the like but Iris and made the

2102
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:06,779
comment that you know these land race

2103
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:09,000
Farmers they've never even had the

2104
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:11,279
opportunity to get mad at people making

2105
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,079
money off their work let alone maybe

2106
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:14,219
even making money themselves and I

2107
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:16,439
thought you know that's a valid point

2108
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:18,359
you know we should try to support these

2109
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:20,039
indigenous cultures uh where possible

2110
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:21,420
because they're truly you know we're all

2111
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:23,399
standing on the shoulders of giants

2112
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,020
right it's not like we it's not like

2113
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:27,059
every breeder out there just found their

2114
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:29,659
plans in the wild and can say yeah I

2115
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:33,120
don't I don't know if thanks to anyone

2116
01:22:29,658 --> 01:22:35,039
well I mean I well for for one I 100

2117
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:36,179
agree with you

2118
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:39,479
um for two

2119
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:42,719
uh not just to defend Fletch a bit in

2120
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:44,939
that regard is that I think his point

2121
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:48,179
wasn't necessarily so much that nobody

2122
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:49,859
should be using dosido but that people

2123
01:22:48,179 --> 01:22:51,840
should be taking their time and their

2124
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:53,698
energy to create stuff

2125
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,980
as well

2126
01:22:53,698 --> 01:22:58,139
right and not just because what's

2127
01:22:55,979 --> 01:23:00,479
happening is is as ever as anything

2128
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,739
becomes popular it gets bred into

2129
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:03,718
everything else

2130
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:05,698
right and then

2131
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:09,719
people should be developing their own

2132
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:13,019
dosi dose right and developing their own

2133
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:15,179
type of stuff and I do think that

2134
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:17,179
in breeding especially because breeding

2135
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:19,619
has changed a lot you know Instagram

2136
01:23:17,179 --> 01:23:22,980
when I was doing most of my breeding

2137
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:26,039
there wasn't even an outlet to to move

2138
01:23:22,979 --> 01:23:29,158
seats right it's really only been the

2139
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:32,279
last eight to ten years with the Advent

2140
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:34,079
of IG and forums and all these different

2141
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:36,479
things going on that a lot of little

2142
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:38,939
breeders have had their day in the Sun

2143
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:41,579
be a lot more difficult I mean you could

2144
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:43,859
do private breeding but selling it and

2145
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:45,300
was a lot was a lot harder and so what

2146
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:48,119
happens is is that what you've probably

2147
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:50,039
noticed is that you know one of the most

2148
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:52,019
common things is people get famous or

2149
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:53,399
get associated with a certain cut or a

2150
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:55,679
certain family or a certain group of

2151
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:57,359
seeds and then they make a seed company

2152
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,359
yeah

2153
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:01,500
right because they're associated with

2154
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:03,420
that and then they make a bunch of

2155
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:05,939
hybrids and stuff and work based off

2156
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:08,219
what they're already known for

2157
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:09,779
um and so I don't want to like name drop

2158
01:24:08,219 --> 01:24:10,980
or anything like that because that I

2159
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:12,479
don't want to call out anybody over

2160
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:14,939
anybody else but there's plenty of

2161
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:16,859
people out there for a long time that

2162
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:18,719
like if you want to use this cut I want

2163
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:21,119
half the seats

2164
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,800
or if you want to use this in Reading I

2165
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:24,840
want to be paid

2166
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,420
and a lot of that went on behind the

2167
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:30,420
scenes and wasn't very well known but

2168
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:31,440
there's lots of people that would really

2169
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:33,420
milk

2170
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:35,819
if something got well known and famous

2171
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:38,399
and you wanted to use it they would sell

2172
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:40,079
the cuttings for 5 or 10 or 15 grand to

2173
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:41,399
cutting or they would demand you all you

2174
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:44,100
want to breed with the seed well I get

2175
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:50,219
50 of them or you got to give me 50 of

2176
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:53,400
the proceeds yeah uh and you know and so

2177
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:55,439
um but you're right and that all those

2178
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:56,579
people that demand that it's not like I

2179
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,379
mean eventually it would become like

2180
01:24:56,579 --> 01:25:00,479
multi-level marketing or something where

2181
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:02,279
they're not kicking any points back to

2182
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:05,099
who they got it yeah that's a good

2183
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:06,779
perspective everyone's in MLM you know

2184
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,640
like they're not like they're like you

2185
01:25:06,779 --> 01:25:10,559
should pay me but I'm not going to kick

2186
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:12,060
any of that up to the people that like I

2187
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,500
didn't breed it I didn't grow it I

2188
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:15,060
didn't even crack the seed I just got it

2189
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,460
early enough and I held it and I

2190
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:19,980
marketed it right

2191
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:21,420
um and you know I mean I could throw out

2192
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:23,158
names out there but it's like then

2193
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:25,560
whoever I named would just get upset at

2194
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:28,019
me right so I'll just I'll just say the

2195
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:30,539
general gist is there's been lots of

2196
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:35,219
cuttings that have been hoarded

2197
01:25:30,539 --> 01:25:37,260
for value and the land race people uh

2198
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:38,880
and you know even people like Neville or

2199
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,219
you know Sam will tell you that

2200
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,380
everything has his [ __ ] in it yeah

2201
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:45,420
Neville would tell you before he passed

2202
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:46,260
that most people in Holland ripped a

2203
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:49,380
month

2204
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:54,119
right right and and it's the same story

2205
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:57,600
today right like you know people do uh

2206
01:25:54,119 --> 01:25:59,519
you know there's no there's no licensing

2207
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,079
really going on in cannabis so it's like

2208
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,880
if the cut gets out

2209
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:05,579
anybody can do whatever they want with

2210
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:08,159
it and it's just the honor System yeah

2211
01:26:05,579 --> 01:26:10,920
right you can try public shaming or

2212
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:13,259
whatever but I mean you know

2213
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:14,880
um you know people were and you you

2214
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:17,520
figure it out and at various times

2215
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,139
people that claim to be the first person

2216
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,179
that had something

2217
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:22,859
and they get very famous for it and time

2218
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:25,859
goes on and you realize that they just

2219
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:27,839
got lucky enough to get it early so more

2220
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:30,119
power to the farmers getting something

2221
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,679
going on now hopefully those band I'm

2222
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:33,420
not trying to diss those guys either but

2223
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,920
hopefully that's just not like a selling

2224
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,679
point for them and they don't kick money

2225
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:39,359
down to the farmers either

2226
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,619
um because that's the honor System as

2227
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:42,238
well right

2228
01:26:40,619 --> 01:26:43,920
uh it's not like you're buying it

2229
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,539
directly from the farmer when it comes

2230
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,000
to that land race stuff you have to hope

2231
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:49,859
that they are paying good money for the

2232
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,960
seed or they are kicking down some of

2233
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:55,619
the benefit of selling to westerners to

2234
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:57,779
those Afghani or those Pakistani uh you

2235
01:26:55,619 --> 01:27:01,260
know Farming Farming families

2236
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:03,000
no doubt I uh I I trust you're as in

2237
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:05,159
these he's passing on as he says he is

2238
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,779
and a quick caveat you know not trying

2239
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:09,539
to have a go at Fletcher there's just a

2240
01:27:06,779 --> 01:27:12,300
talking point still love you to come

2241
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:14,880
oh no that's why I didn't meant I could

2242
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,679
have mentioned four or five people you

2243
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,940
know like but I just didn't because I

2244
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:20,819
was like oh man at least two of them

2245
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:23,279
will get mad at me but but it but it's

2246
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:24,779
the truth you know some people like one

2247
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:27,840
of the one of the ways to make money and

2248
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:30,899
weed was like was you get some cut early

2249
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,880
and if there's a huge demand for it and

2250
01:27:30,899 --> 01:27:34,500
you know some people are hoarding it and

2251
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,359
then there's that one guy that's like

2252
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,420
I'm willing to sell this cut for top

2253
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:40,500
dollar or I'm willing to make seeds with

2254
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,359
this cutter I'm gonna be the first

2255
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,500
person that goes on a forum and talks

2256
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:45,599
about it

2257
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,738
and then I'm gonna get famous for it

2258
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,079
right

2259
01:27:46,738 --> 01:27:50,939
and sometimes it can take a long time

2260
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:53,399
for the Nuance of what exactly happened

2261
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:55,019
to come out

2262
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:56,939
um and but that's I mean you've probably

2263
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,860
seen it right like how many people have

2264
01:27:56,939 --> 01:28:01,738
you interviewed

2265
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:04,619
and you interviewed them because they're

2266
01:28:01,738 --> 01:28:06,119
closely associated with a famous cut or

2267
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:08,099
a famous line

2268
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:10,500
and you want to get the story of it from

2269
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:13,980
them and then what they did with it

2270
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:15,600
um yeah regularly regularly it's pretty

2271
01:28:13,979 --> 01:28:17,218
it's one of the most common ways to get

2272
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,520
famous in weed right

2273
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:23,279
yeah definitely definitely and look I

2274
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:25,500
mean again peace and love to to Fletcher

2275
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:27,539
I I know he uh he doesn't necessarily

2276
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:29,520
want to come on the show but again uh

2277
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:32,100
kudos for the work while we're talking

2278
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,080
about the the land race stuff

2279
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,639
it's you made a really good point that

2280
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,198
you know they're not necessarily growing

2281
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:39,659
this stuff for flour they're growing it

2282
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:42,119
for concentrate and I would love to

2283
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:43,799
springboard into you know are you are

2284
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:45,658
you a flower guy are you a concentrates

2285
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:47,579
guy do you lean more to one than the

2286
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:49,198
other and and if you prefer one what is

2287
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:51,359
it about the other you know because I'll

2288
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:53,579
I'll happily tell anyone I don't really

2289
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,259
smoke concentrates because to be honest

2290
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:57,139
my tolerance is kind of low and I just

2291
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,639
get [ __ ] up it's just that simple

2292
01:28:57,139 --> 01:29:02,420
where do you land yeah

2293
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:06,359
I mean I am a flower person 100

2294
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:07,980
uh you know I it's not like I don't like

2295
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:10,259
hash

2296
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:11,879
um but if I was forced to choose one or

2297
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:14,460
the other for eternity I would

2298
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:17,219
absolutely choose flour

2299
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:19,139
um and some of that is is you know like

2300
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:21,539
the relationships with the plant or

2301
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:22,920
whatever concentrates are that just that

2302
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:24,539
they're concentrated

2303
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,460
and so

2304
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:27,840
you know like when you're breeding and

2305
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:31,739
stuff like that

2306
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:34,020
and you're trying to sort out like uh

2307
01:29:31,738 --> 01:29:36,119
I think when you're when when you breed

2308
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:38,219
and you're trying out different types of

2309
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:40,380
cannabis

2310
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:41,460
um keeping your tolerance at a flower

2311
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,800
level

2312
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,480
uh is important

2313
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,820
right

2314
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:48,839
um and I have I have thoughts on on and

2315
01:29:47,819 --> 01:29:50,819
you know this will this will get

2316
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:54,119
everybody all all tightened up or

2317
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:56,279
whatever but for me I just prefer when I

2318
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:57,479
get really baked on flour I like that

2319
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:00,539
feeling more

2320
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:04,678
than I do off concentrates

2321
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:07,560
um you know I think flour is the purest

2322
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:10,079
way to smoke it right

2323
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:12,440
um because it has you're not altering it

2324
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:16,079
in any way other than heat yeah right

2325
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:18,000
where you know when you when you know

2326
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:20,639
when you put it through BHO when you put

2327
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,158
it through uh water when you put it

2328
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:25,260
through a freeze dryer when you do all

2329
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:28,259
these different things do it a lot of

2330
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:31,139
times that changes that changes various

2331
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:35,520
aspects of of the the buzz or the flavor

2332
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:38,699
profile or anything like that and so

2333
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:42,540
you know I I also think that like modern

2334
01:30:38,698 --> 01:30:44,460
hash is incredibly different than

2335
01:30:42,539 --> 01:30:47,760
traditional hash

2336
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:50,639
like they're not similar at all

2337
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:53,639
um for a variety of reasons uh the

2338
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:56,039
biggest reason is that most modern hash

2339
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:59,699
is single source

2340
01:30:56,039 --> 01:31:01,679
yeah right it's it you take one clone

2341
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:04,799
okay

2342
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:06,600
um and you know you grow that clone in a

2343
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,460
outdoor Greenhouse or an indoor whatever

2344
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,500
situation you do and then you harvest it

2345
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,779
and you extract however you're going to

2346
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:17,219
extract it but it's just that one

2347
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:20,219
genetic where most traditional hash is

2348
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:24,179
like a field of sisters

2349
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:25,920
yeah yeah yeah yep so think about like

2350
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:28,260
think about the difference between like

2351
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:31,199
you know uh

2352
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:33,420
you know you like one Australian in the

2353
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:34,559
town you live versus like the entire

2354
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:36,779
town

2355
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,520
and like the diversity contained within

2356
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:40,979
that

2357
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,480
you know so with cannabis if you're

2358
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:45,359
getting a bunch of sisters you're kind

2359
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:46,459
of getting a mix of you know THC

2360
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:49,039
percentages

2361
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:53,819
CBD CBN

2362
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:56,158
thcv this that whatever else and so we

2363
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:57,359
don't actually grow

2364
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:59,339
um the biggest thing we have an

2365
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:02,099
advantage of over

2366
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:03,600
um traditional hashish I think is purity

2367
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:06,179
you know obviously there's a lot of

2368
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:09,480
pressure on those Farmers to get weight

2369
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:11,819
and sell kilos and so most of the best

2370
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:14,698
hash that comes from that region never

2371
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:16,619
leaves that region and so you know if

2372
01:32:14,698 --> 01:32:18,419
your experience with hash is Hash that's

2373
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:20,579
been adulterated or hashed that's had

2374
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:22,139
other Funk pounded into it for more

2375
01:32:20,579 --> 01:32:24,658
weight

2376
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:26,579
um most people the hash they make at

2377
01:32:24,658 --> 01:32:28,500
home is going to be a lot higher quality

2378
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:30,359
than the best quality traditional than

2379
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:34,800
they've had access to

2380
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:37,319
but if you go to say Holland where

2381
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,039
Holland obviously has a land connection

2382
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:42,719
to Asia

2383
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:45,840
Holland would get was a much more of a

2384
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:48,719
hash culture than a flower culture right

2385
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,119
and those guys over there

2386
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,158
that were growing a lot of those strains

2387
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:56,219
for the the the

2388
01:32:53,158 --> 01:32:58,379
um the shops the coffee shops

2389
01:32:56,219 --> 01:33:00,179
um to the to a man almost all of them

2390
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:02,279
would sell the weed and they would buy

2391
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:05,480
the best hash they could find

2392
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:08,099
yes all of them believe that the best

2393
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:11,339
grade of traditional hash from different

2394
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:13,500
regions in both taste and effect is

2395
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:16,159
superior to most of the modern flower

2396
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,158
that you grow

2397
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:22,560
um and so but as a result of like the

2398
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:25,259
hash revolution in America really

2399
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,600
happening in I don't remember when nails

2400
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:29,460
and some of the like accoutrements that

2401
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,039
made actually hash smoking easier

2402
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:33,359
started happening and Banger started

2403
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:35,880
coming out but I would say it was

2404
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:39,679
probably like 10 or 12 years ago 15

2405
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:43,079
years ago maybe like late 2010 2012

2406
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:45,658
2014. when we first started smoking BHO

2407
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:47,819
and stuff in the early 2000s like even

2408
01:33:45,658 --> 01:33:49,500
consuming it was a was a big pain in the

2409
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:52,198
ass

2410
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:54,300
um we didn't have all of the tools and

2411
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:57,119
all you know and all the heated nails or

2412
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:59,460
the glass or you know the smoke pearls

2413
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:00,719
or the bangers or whatever name you want

2414
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:04,500
to add to all the stuff that you have

2415
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:08,039
now there's this whole like wave of

2416
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:11,039
stuff that you use to smoke hash now

2417
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:15,479
and that's all been developed over time

2418
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:17,639
right and so you know they have I think

2419
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:19,738
most hash is like

2420
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:21,179
you know does it taste good does it

2421
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:23,638
yield well

2422
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:26,520
that's what they're after like you see

2423
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:28,619
people talking about washers or dumpers

2424
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:30,000
right that's all about how much weight

2425
01:34:28,619 --> 01:34:32,460
it gives you

2426
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,960
but there's a lot of really high quality

2427
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:36,840
strains that we were just talking about

2428
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:39,000
where like earlier in the show that they

2429
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,520
don't wash well so therefore they would

2430
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,079
never get made into hash like why would

2431
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,820
you and I don't I don't even know what

2432
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:46,859
Shoreline wash is but let's say that you

2433
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:48,960
like absolutely adore Shoreline but it

2434
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:51,119
only washes three and a half percent

2435
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,520
where you get some other grapes and

2436
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:54,539
cream by Skittles and it washes six

2437
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,980
percent

2438
01:34:54,539 --> 01:34:58,979
yeah

2439
01:34:55,979 --> 01:35:02,279
right the extractor is going to make a

2440
01:34:58,979 --> 01:35:03,479
lot more money washing the stuff that

2441
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:06,238
yields more

2442
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:10,019
so the hash Market in America is very as

2443
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:12,658
is very much based on color look smell

2444
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:15,679
and weight

2445
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:18,119
um I no I didn't I didn't mention effect

2446
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:20,039
that's what I was gonna ask you know and

2447
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:21,658
and like I'm sure you've got a little

2448
01:35:20,039 --> 01:35:24,300
more to follow up so I'll let you finish

2449
01:35:21,658 --> 01:35:27,658
but just as a as a caveat do you think

2450
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:29,699
you can get like real sativa effects

2451
01:35:27,658 --> 01:35:31,079
from a concentrate

2452
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:34,678
sure

2453
01:35:31,079 --> 01:35:36,719
I mean I I um

2454
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:39,600
I've seen people

2455
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:41,279
I've seen people smoke like really pure

2456
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,739
like uh

2457
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:47,039
um heads you know like basically pressed

2458
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:49,619
Keith uh of like say Neville's Haze in

2459
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:51,779
Holland and had one or two hits like

2460
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:54,479
take them out and end their night

2461
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:56,579
uh you know uh you can absolutely you

2462
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,678
can absolutely get that but

2463
01:35:56,579 --> 01:36:00,359
you know that that would be like we were

2464
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:02,579
talking earlier in the show that would

2465
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:07,259
be as the market matures

2466
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:09,059
and demand for rarer or you know uh

2467
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:11,340
certain certain things becomes more

2468
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:13,020
valuable enough that it gets offered as

2469
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:17,340
a consumer product

2470
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:21,420
because if you sativas are are pretty

2471
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:22,860
rare right yeah think about how rare you

2472
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:24,719
know imagine if you start looking around

2473
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:29,158
and you're like I want to get a really

2474
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:32,639
nice few grams of pure sativa hash

2475
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:35,158
that's even rarer yeah God uphill battle

2476
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:39,060
you know that's that's that's even rarer

2477
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:40,559
to get so it's I think that I'm not you

2478
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:42,239
know I don't have any issue with hash or

2479
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,039
anything like that and there's plenty of

2480
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:46,198
people that like all they smoke is hash

2481
01:36:44,039 --> 01:36:47,698
and there's there's now there's a divide

2482
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:50,279
in the Canada community over there's

2483
01:36:47,698 --> 01:36:51,719
hash people and weed people and there's

2484
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:53,939
some differences and sometimes people

2485
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:55,439
make fun of each other or whatever I'm

2486
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:57,119
not here to like say that like my

2487
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:59,339
preferences are better than anybody

2488
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:01,738
else's as far as what I like

2489
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:04,079
but I like smoking joints and I like

2490
01:37:01,738 --> 01:37:05,339
taking bong hits

2491
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:07,439
um a flower

2492
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:09,600
uh that's what seems to be that's what

2493
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:12,599
seems to me and it gives the best effect

2494
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,219
of what I like uh do I like do I smoke

2495
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:16,980
hash sometimes

2496
01:37:14,219 --> 01:37:20,899
um you know sure do I like certain kinds

2497
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:24,000
of hash yes do I think a lot of Mitzi

2498
01:37:20,899 --> 01:37:25,559
weed is getting turned into hash and

2499
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,639
people are saying that it's amazing

2500
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,679
because of how it looks yes

2501
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:34,199
certainly certainly look I should have I

2502
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,359
should have asked a second ago but you

2503
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:38,279
mentioned how you know these early Dutch

2504
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:41,939
Growers they would sell their crop go

2505
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:44,219
and get some hash and I think that a

2506
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:47,158
part of that probably has to do with the

2507
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:49,260
fact that they blend with tobacco so

2508
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:51,719
heavily over there and it raises the

2509
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:54,360
more modern talking point of the past

2510
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:56,579
few ego clashes the concentrate sections

2511
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:57,960
have actually been won by Blends people

2512
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:00,600
where they're blending two or three

2513
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:03,300
strains and I remember when I spoke with

2514
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,500
Bodhi many years ago he made this

2515
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:07,440
statement you know that we really

2516
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:09,539
haven't explored the realm of blending

2517
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:11,539
all that much as a community

2518
01:38:09,539 --> 01:38:14,698
what's your thoughts on blending I mean

2519
01:38:11,539 --> 01:38:16,619
say as a starting point the Dutch using

2520
01:38:14,698 --> 01:38:18,960
the tobacco is it sort of a necessary

2521
01:38:16,619 --> 01:38:21,420
evil in a sense but also more modernly

2522
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,460
do you think we can expect to see more

2523
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:26,158
adventuring into the realm of blending

2524
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:28,619
now we're talking about uh blending of

2525
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:31,738
different strains or blending of tobacco

2526
01:38:28,619 --> 01:38:33,059
or both yeah I guess both because as a

2527
01:38:31,738 --> 01:38:35,759
whole thing you know and and I mean

2528
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:37,860
Bodhi even referenced the idea of um in

2529
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,139
other psychedelics they they blend

2530
01:38:37,859 --> 01:38:41,819
different you know sort of sacred plants

2531
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:43,920
I forget the names of the ones he

2532
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:46,500
mentioned but um you know some of them

2533
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:48,199
are like made from dried out succulents

2534
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,760
and stuff and it's real common in

2535
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:52,019
indigenous cultures to blend tobacco and

2536
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:55,020
that and are wondering what's your

2537
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:59,520
thoughts obviously a big topic uh it is

2538
01:38:55,020 --> 01:39:02,880
a big topic you know I think that uh

2539
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,620
some of it is what's normal to you is

2540
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,679
what's normal to you

2541
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:09,479
right so you are a product to some

2542
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,800
degree of the culture that you grow up

2543
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:14,519
in

2544
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,920
okay uh and so as a result of that like

2545
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:19,320
how you smoke and how you consume

2546
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:22,859
cannabis is based upon that culture

2547
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:24,960
right so if you're growing up in Holland

2548
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:27,238
and most people are blending it with

2549
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,679
tobacco that's how you're going to learn

2550
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:30,419
how to smoke

2551
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:31,920
when you start getting into smoking and

2552
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,639
so that's what's going to be normal to

2553
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,859
you

2554
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,139
if you came up in America where we

2555
01:39:34,859 --> 01:39:39,059
didn't do that very much the opposite

2556
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:41,039
would be true and you would be like oh I

2557
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:43,500
smoke you know

2558
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:46,260
um I just smoke pure pure flour I will

2559
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:49,139
say that definitely when we first went

2560
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:51,060
to Amsterdam in the 90s

2561
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:52,940
um they thought we were nuts for Rolling

2562
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:57,300
joints of pure weed

2563
01:39:52,939 --> 01:39:59,399
uh and I I had to get a little drunk to

2564
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:01,679
be honest to be in some of the coffee

2565
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:04,259
shops because if you go in Winter where

2566
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:06,658
it's kind of cold and nasty out

2567
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:08,940
if you're in some little coffee shop and

2568
01:40:06,658 --> 01:40:11,219
there's like six or seven spliffs going

2569
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:14,039
on that like are mostly tobacco with

2570
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:17,819
like a hash snake down the middle

2571
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:20,158
that's so much smoke and so if you're

2572
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:22,799
not a tobacco smoker it's literally like

2573
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:26,339
a haze of tobacco with a little bit of

2574
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:28,679
weed mixed in and it stinks and it's

2575
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:32,279
it's pretty intense right

2576
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:35,279
now you know I think that tobacco and

2577
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:37,319
and you know it's like uh it's a

2578
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,059
different drug too so people get a

2579
01:40:37,319 --> 01:40:41,519
zippiness from it they get a different

2580
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:46,139
Rush from it and so people might

2581
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:48,719
associate like that buzz I don't like

2582
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:50,819
tobacco so I'm not going to be big into

2583
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:52,980
the blending thing

2584
01:40:50,819 --> 01:40:54,779
um but there are people around around me

2585
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:57,479
who smoke spliffs

2586
01:40:54,779 --> 01:41:00,000
um there's a there's a a movement in the

2587
01:40:57,479 --> 01:41:03,178
youth around here they call them 50s

2588
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,579
right where they'll take American Spirit

2589
01:41:03,179 --> 01:41:09,119
tobacco and pack half a bong of American

2590
01:41:05,579 --> 01:41:12,658
Spirit and half a bong of flour and take

2591
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:15,059
bong rips of both huh

2592
01:41:12,658 --> 01:41:18,539
and they call them 50s

2593
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:20,340
and there's a big way you know and so

2594
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:22,920
yeah I I do think that that stuff is

2595
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:25,980
going to happen people do blend drugs

2596
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:27,060
people do blend you know things of that

2597
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:27,779
nature

2598
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:31,199
um

2599
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:32,698
I don't like tobacco and I also think

2600
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:34,259
that much like you know I was telling

2601
01:41:32,698 --> 01:41:36,960
you about just just a minute ago about

2602
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:39,119
how you know if you're a breeder you're

2603
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:42,118
better off keeping your tolerance at a

2604
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:45,799
flower level so you can judge flour yep

2605
01:41:42,118 --> 01:41:50,059
I do think it's a lot harder to judge

2606
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:53,880
nuances if you're going to blend

2607
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:57,119
yeah yeah hugely right

2608
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:58,739
like you know I mean take take wine for

2609
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:01,618
instance let's say that you wanna you

2610
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:03,599
wanna judge a nice Merlot then you just

2611
01:42:01,618 --> 01:42:05,158
like you drink them or low but what if

2612
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,659
you add a little bit of Zinfandel in it

2613
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:09,000
or you'll add a little bit of Cabernet

2614
01:42:06,658 --> 01:42:10,439
in it and you mix it all up

2615
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,479
right

2616
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:14,158
it's making it much harder for you to

2617
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:16,319
judge that thing by itself because

2618
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:19,500
there's other elements in there

2619
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:21,599
yeah it certainly does make it harder

2620
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:25,198
and also you know there's the the

2621
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:27,840
comment about being able to clearly

2622
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:29,939
um analyze and break down the flavor

2623
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,400
profile you know I think that undeniably

2624
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:35,039
is also a modeled effect

2625
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:37,138
I mean I will say too that like going

2626
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:37,920
back to like when

2627
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:41,279
um

2628
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,618
when like BHO and and you know that kind

2629
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:46,679
of thing first became popular

2630
01:42:43,618 --> 01:42:48,960
it allowed a lot of strains that were

2631
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:52,980
not very potent to be acceptable to

2632
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:54,960
people right so to give you an example

2633
01:42:52,979 --> 01:42:57,479
there was a point in time when it was

2634
01:42:54,960 --> 01:43:00,899
very difficult to even give away Cali o

2635
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:04,799
in California right because it was just

2636
01:43:00,899 --> 01:43:07,319
that pure orange flavor it most orange

2637
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:11,699
stuff is not very potent so it was very

2638
01:43:07,319 --> 01:43:13,979
light high it was very one note okay and

2639
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:18,238
it kind of fell out of favor

2640
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:21,059
and then Tangy came out right when the

2641
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:23,698
BHO thing really started and all of a

2642
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:26,580
sudden you could take this like 10 or 12

2643
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:28,559
or 14 Tangy that wasn't very potent and

2644
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:30,300
didn't get you ripped and you could make

2645
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,280
some BHO of it and all of a sudden it's

2646
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:33,920
85 THC

2647
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:37,559
and it works

2648
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:39,779
and it tastes really strong so it took a

2649
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:42,060
lot of like lightweed that was kind of

2650
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:43,979
like midsie in effect and it

2651
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:46,139
concentrated the effect to where it was

2652
01:43:43,979 --> 01:43:48,959
at an acceptable level

2653
01:43:46,139 --> 01:43:50,819
yeah yeah yeah definitely it was it was

2654
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,980
a part of the way it came round didn't

2655
01:43:50,819 --> 01:43:54,719
it and I mean you know not to change the

2656
01:43:52,979 --> 01:43:56,039
topic quickly but I mean we're not even

2657
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:57,600
changing the topic really but you

2658
01:43:56,039 --> 01:43:59,760
mentioned Calio and I did want to talk

2659
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:01,320
about you because I was thinking to

2660
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,060
myself it sort of fit in with that

2661
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:04,500
category of you know when we were

2662
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:06,360
talking about the train wreck and the

2663
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:07,738
blue dream and the gray pipe it was sort

2664
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:10,559
of you know a little before that era but

2665
01:44:07,738 --> 01:44:13,198
still in that time how do you feel about

2666
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:15,360
Calio as a smoke these days objectively

2667
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:17,279
you know do you think what I've heard is

2668
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:19,259
you know it's it's great flavor but it's

2669
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:22,019
maybe not exactly very strong by modern

2670
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:26,100
standards what's your thoughts on it

2671
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:28,139
I mean I would agree with that 100 uh

2672
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,760
whether or not you know great flavor is

2673
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:31,679
obviously subjective

2674
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:35,699
I would say that the flavor is pretty

2675
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:38,279
one note right so if you like strong

2676
01:44:35,698 --> 01:44:40,259
flavor of oranges

2677
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:42,118
on your tongue it's going to give you

2678
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:44,100
that in spades

2679
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:46,799
it doesn't have a lot of nuance to it

2680
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:48,060
it's very one note and very forward it's

2681
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,060
also

2682
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:54,360
um because it's old uh it's you know it

2683
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:56,880
has it has a lot lower THC percentage in

2684
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:59,279
general and its effect is pretty light

2685
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:01,020
so what happens to people with a lot of

2686
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,539
the Citrus in my opinion whether it's

2687
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:05,400
orange Citrus or lemon

2688
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:07,439
um or you know that type of thing is

2689
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:10,079
that it's almost like a good palate

2690
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:11,819
cleanser right like eating like Pickled

2691
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:13,800
ginger at a sushi bar or something like

2692
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:15,059
that yeah yeah yeah but it's not

2693
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,800
something that you'd want for your main

2694
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:19,080
course and it's not like you know you're

2695
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:21,300
like okay I'm on vacation I'm on this

2696
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:24,059
island and I have this huge jar of Cali

2697
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:26,940
o you're not going to be that stoked

2698
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:28,560
you know it's like it's good as a as a

2699
01:45:26,939 --> 01:45:30,059
change of pace it's good as a palette

2700
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,699
cleanser it's good to smoke for a little

2701
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:35,340
bit but the problem is is that almost

2702
01:45:32,698 --> 01:45:37,859
universally most people are like that

2703
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:40,199
can't be my daily driver right like

2704
01:45:37,859 --> 01:45:42,059
there's there's people that um there's

2705
01:45:40,198 --> 01:45:43,678
people that there's weed out there that

2706
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:46,980
ends up being people's daily driver

2707
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:50,760
right like for me I could smoke the dog

2708
01:45:46,979 --> 01:45:52,198
or the sour diesel or you know there's I

2709
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:53,699
could go on and on but there's there's

2710
01:45:52,198 --> 01:45:56,899
certain ones where it's like if I had to

2711
01:45:53,698 --> 01:46:00,000
smoke that every day I'd be happy

2712
01:45:56,899 --> 01:46:02,759
right and there's ones that after a few

2713
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,738
puffs or after a few days you like not

2714
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:07,500
only are you like sort of bored by it

2715
01:46:04,738 --> 01:46:10,319
because it has like a a short or a flat

2716
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:12,238
or a quick duration as far as the high

2717
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:14,579
but a lot of times certain things

2718
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:16,979
plateau

2719
01:46:14,579 --> 01:46:19,019
do you get that experience where like

2720
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:21,779
certain strains get you high every day

2721
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:23,639
and they that potency carries through on

2722
01:46:21,779 --> 01:46:26,698
a daily basis and you get the same like

2723
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:28,260
strong effect and then certain things

2724
01:46:26,698 --> 01:46:30,118
you might get high the first day or two

2725
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:32,400
but after three or four days of smoking

2726
01:46:30,118 --> 01:46:34,559
it the high really levels out and it's

2727
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:37,559
kind of flat and uninteresting yeah

2728
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:40,920
definitely definitely so I kind of think

2729
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:43,800
Cali o is like uh it's like fashion

2730
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:45,960
right like it goes into fashion for a

2731
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,760
few years and then everyone gets super

2732
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:49,560
over it and then it falls off the face

2733
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,300
of the Earth and then it comes back in a

2734
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,580
different form

2735
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:55,800
um to me the Tangy movement was

2736
01:46:53,579 --> 01:46:58,859
basically like an improved Calio just

2737
01:46:55,800 --> 01:47:01,260
those same orange Terps you know well

2738
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:02,880
what what's your thoughts on like the

2739
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:05,340
Forbidden fruits and the Tropicana

2740
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,739
cookies because to me it seems very much

2741
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:10,560
in that same realm would you say that

2742
01:47:07,738 --> 01:47:13,079
those are improvements or still just in

2743
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,880
the same vein

2744
01:47:13,079 --> 01:47:17,158
no there's things that I actually like

2745
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,199
about forbidden fruit I think it's got

2746
01:47:17,158 --> 01:47:22,259
some cool genetics in it in the sense

2747
01:47:19,198 --> 01:47:25,019
that it can really throw a lot of nice

2748
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:27,119
buds in low light conditions I grew it

2749
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:29,040
once in a greenhouse where I didn't even

2750
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:31,380
put it in until the 15th of September

2751
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,658
and where that Greenhouse was it only

2752
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:35,400
got about five or six hours of light at

2753
01:47:33,658 --> 01:47:37,138
that late in the year because the sun

2754
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:39,839
went behind the hill

2755
01:47:37,139 --> 01:47:42,900
and most things needed significantly

2756
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:44,940
more light in order to form up well and

2757
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:47,339
the Forbidden Fruit formed huge colas

2758
01:47:44,939 --> 01:47:48,599
all over it like no big deal like it got

2759
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:50,219
that five hours of light and that was

2760
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,500
all it needed and it was and it's

2761
01:47:50,219 --> 01:47:56,100
beautiful it's purple it's extremely

2762
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:58,859
visually attractive and it smells

2763
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:00,719
basically like one note Calio and it

2764
01:47:58,859 --> 01:48:02,039
also is not very potent

2765
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:05,158
so

2766
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:07,859
I like I said I can I can I can have

2767
01:48:05,158 --> 01:48:09,479
some of that as some Pickled ginger

2768
01:48:07,859 --> 01:48:11,939
um but I'm not going to be eating it a

2769
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:13,799
bunch of it or eat you know daily it's

2770
01:48:11,939 --> 01:48:16,019
it's pretty it's pretty one note for me

2771
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:17,820
hello I like that analogy you know the

2772
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:21,119
um the the jar of coffee in between

2773
01:48:17,819 --> 01:48:23,279
smelling colognes yeah well I mean when

2774
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:25,198
we were at that event you get to a point

2775
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:27,000
where it's like how many jars of weed

2776
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:28,439
can you smell before you need to take a

2777
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,779
break because you've kind of blown your

2778
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:33,000
sensors out yeah hugely sensory

2779
01:48:30,779 --> 01:48:34,439
overload's a real thing right yeah so

2780
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,658
you were just saying like smell some

2781
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:38,158
coffee you know like there's like that's

2782
01:48:36,658 --> 01:48:39,539
why I said palette cleanser because

2783
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:42,059
there's things that can kind of like

2784
01:48:39,539 --> 01:48:43,560
wash away what was in there and reset

2785
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:45,960
your palette so that you can try

2786
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:49,020
something else and that would be that

2787
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:51,539
would be my my orange

2788
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:54,060
um the only the only Citrus I really

2789
01:48:51,539 --> 01:48:55,859
like is I like citrus that has a

2790
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,580
creaminess or a sweetness on the back

2791
01:48:55,859 --> 01:48:58,500
end

2792
01:48:56,579 --> 01:49:01,079
the Citrus that's like extremely

2793
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:03,658
astringent and citrus in one note I get

2794
01:49:01,079 --> 01:49:06,779
bored of that super fast

2795
01:49:03,658 --> 01:49:09,359
um the Citrus that has some softness or

2796
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:11,340
some you know some sweetness behind it

2797
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:13,139
and maybe some other elements that come

2798
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:16,199
through that to me is more interesting

2799
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:18,118
but I think there's a reason why

2800
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:19,919
Citrus comes and goes in the community

2801
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:23,819
because most people

2802
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:25,800
end up and getting bored of it yeah look

2803
01:49:23,819 --> 01:49:27,299
people will bug me if I don't ask any

2804
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:29,520
Australians immediately jump to mind

2805
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:31,139
that fit that criteria you mentioned of

2806
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,360
sort of more appealing to with the

2807
01:49:31,139 --> 01:49:36,539
creamy sweetness

2808
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:39,479
um yeah you know there's uh gosh now I'm

2809
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:42,179
gonna be there was a there was a cut we

2810
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:43,618
had I lost it in the 17 fires I have

2811
01:49:42,179 --> 01:49:46,139
some seeds of it still there was a cut

2812
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:49,319
we called the tangerine

2813
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:51,960
um and it it was very Citrus but it had

2814
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:53,819
this this sweetness on the back end

2815
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:55,319
that's sort of like it's almost like in

2816
01:49:53,819 --> 01:49:57,118
food you know when you have something

2817
01:49:55,319 --> 01:50:00,539
and you need something to like cut the

2818
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:03,000
flavor and add some depth right

2819
01:50:00,539 --> 01:50:04,679
um that's what I mean so like when I

2820
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,618
smoke lemon tree it smells like someone

2821
01:50:04,679 --> 01:50:10,020
just sprayed lemon cleaner in my mouth

2822
01:50:07,618 --> 01:50:11,460
and that's good for one or two hits but

2823
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:13,380
at the end of the day I'm like ah it's

2824
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:16,560
not so much for me

2825
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:18,539
um and so I can't think besides that

2826
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,520
Tangerine I can't think of you're not

2827
01:50:18,539 --> 01:50:24,840
going to get a bunch of depth on Citrus

2828
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:26,460
from me uh Citrus is

2829
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:28,860
um I could I could tell you something

2830
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:32,760
funny right that uh when we just had

2831
01:50:28,859 --> 01:50:35,039
that event uh CSI brought a bunch of uh

2832
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:36,179
various seeds to give away to to friends

2833
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:38,158
that were there

2834
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:39,539
and at the end of the night he dumped a

2835
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,879
bunch of stuff on the ground and just

2836
01:50:39,539 --> 01:50:44,519
let people pick what they wanted

2837
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:47,600
and the stuff that was left was all

2838
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:47,600
Calio hybrids

2839
01:50:47,658 --> 01:50:52,920
like out of the eight or ten or 12 packs

2840
01:50:51,179 --> 01:50:55,380
that were that were left and nobody

2841
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:58,219
grabbed at the end it was all something

2842
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:58,219
by Calio
