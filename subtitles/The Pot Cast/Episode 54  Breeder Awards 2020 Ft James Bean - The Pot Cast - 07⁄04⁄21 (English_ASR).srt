that's been it's been it's been a bumpy

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,419
2020 but you know uh I didn't get sued

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,400
by any processors or have any banks

76
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,378
trying to rip my [ __ ] off or you know

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,700
the website stayed up so I'm good I'm

78
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,039
good

79
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,598
wow this is unheard of how did you

80
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,459
manage to do it

81
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,139
I don't know uh I haven't had a credit

82
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,158
card processor all year so you know

83
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,119
maybe that's how they didn't they

84
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,919
weren't able to steal my money because

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,539
they didn't give it to them and the guys

86
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,458
you know finally got the case dropped

87
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,280
for the processor tried to sue me for

88
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,259
200 000 got that dropped this year uh

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,959
didn't do an emerald cup so that helped

90
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,239
with finances uh didn't do trade shows

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,959
that helped uh

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,700
busting home that's a really brilliant

93
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,280
point you bring up I think for the past

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,139
12 months I've been talking to many

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,818
guests on the show about whether or not

96
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,339
they think the emerald cup will be

97
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:58,139
something they do in future years or any

98
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,700
of the broader events for that fact but

99
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,979
I think Emerald cups are pretty focal

100
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,139
one what's your thoughts on the emerald

101
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,959
Cup itself and should we expect to see

102
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,119
seeds here now in the future

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,259
well I I don't think you'll see my booth

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,360
there um

105
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:15,060
we I think we did our last working with

106
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,500
them when I had the the 10 booths at the

107
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,620
last show there

108
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,959
um I think that will be our you know end

109
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,978
of it I think and I think the whole the

110
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,780
whole vibe is just going to change

111
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,519
period because of wreck you know wreck

112
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,619
comes in and it smashes everything and

113
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,000
it says no smoking in public and it

114
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,478
kills all the shows no public

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,839
consumption so you know uh

116
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:40,079
it has to change it's inevitable

117
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,539
yeah and I mean a bit of a hairy topic

118
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,060
but I remember around the time of wreck

119
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,800
coming in in California at least there

120
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,199
was lots of discussion from the pro

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,759
wreck people about how it's going to

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,139
bring like it's going to increase the

123
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,879
consumer base you're going to get more

124
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,560
casual enthusiasts there's going to be

125
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,079
more money in circulation for everyone

126
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,839
but from what I've seen over the past

127
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,060
three or four years now it seems as

128
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,539
though it's almost caused the real

129
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,040
die-hard Market to fall off a bit and

130
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,560
they're sure enough there is a lot of

131
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,780
people casually consuming cannabis but

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,519
it feels like our sort of crew of people

133
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,339
who are like you know the real down the

134
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,319
rabbit hole fanaticals it it kind of

135
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,959
feels like it's died off a little bit

136
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,639
what's your thoughts on that I I think

137
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,799
it has as the

138
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,620
as the shows in the west were passed

139
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,478
first back in 2010 2011 as the shows in

140
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,519
the west the wreck has caught up with

141
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,620
them they've become less cannabis

142
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,240
friendly like sure sell it and do this

143
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,220
and that or talk about it but you can't

144
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,160
sell any of it and all the big players

145
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,780
you're our crowd our crowd would be tied

146
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,639
up in a wrecked market now or have a

147
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,719
recreational facility therefore they

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,038
don't want to you know mess up their

149
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,080
facility or their license because they

150
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,939
want to go out and sell some beans or a

151
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,918
show and so

152
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,259
um it has fallen off and you know like

153
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,839
you know the laws have caught up with

154
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,220
with uh with with the shows you know

155
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,560
there's not any High Times cups in

156
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,360
Seattle or Portland OR California

157
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,038
anymore it's it's going to be very rough

158
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,080
for anybody to participate in those

159
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,360
shows as a producer or somebody who

160
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,978
makes genetics because they have you

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,160
know potentially can lose all their all

162
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:16,680
their uh their licensing and everything

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,139
yeah it's an interesting position it's

164
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,939
put us in I mean you might be in a bit

165
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,579
of a good position to answer this one

166
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,120
but have you spoken to any of your

167
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:29,159
breeders or any Associates you have who

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,500
are kind of happy with the way it's all

169
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,360
panned out or do most people sort of

170
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,899
wish it maybe you panned out a little

171
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,500
differently what's your thoughts

172
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:43,318
uh well I think that everybody is not

173
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,060
happy with their laws independently but

174
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,800
there are just as a general consensus

175
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,319
they all are not thrilled with the way

176
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,900
things are going I know um when exotic

177
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,639
first got his wreck in Washington [ __ ]

178
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,138
was rough for him you know that guy is a

179
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,759
multi-billionaire and have all this

180
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,680
stuff with all these all these all this

181
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,840
money and into the beginning of his Rec

182
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,918
shops in Washington was was rough you

183
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,019
know I mean it was it was a rough start

184
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,159
they put a lot of restraints on it sort

185
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,318
of safe but he's been able to get

186
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,780
through it but um

187
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,400
but no everybody you know like there's

188
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,739
so many things wrong with Nick the

189
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,239
Washington law for example no home grow

190
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,579
um there's California law for example

191
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,918
they they it was six per person per

192
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,959
household now it's six per address and

193
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,339
so they're just you know and no no taxes

194
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,079
on medical now now they're taxing

195
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,859
medical how do you how do you tax on

196
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,598
medicine

197
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,759
you know but

198
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,680
so I think that you know they sold them

199
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,060
at a bill of [ __ ] for the for the

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,379
California one and everybody's [ __ ]

201
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,360
about that when I'm pissed off and

202
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,978
because you know just what they didn't

203
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,900
want to happen was big big corporate

204
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:41,459
Catalyst to come in and and they came in

205
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,138
and got cozy

206
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,719
so

207
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,280
yeah that's interesting and you raised

208
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,340
an interesting point there over the past

209
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,739
year we've seen a number of different

210
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,899
um like well-respected journalistic

211
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,478
platforms discuss how some of the big

212
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:00,318
producers have gone bust most notably in

213
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,639
Canada I think their wreck scene is lost

214
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
incredible amounts of money across the

215
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
board with just crop failure and

216
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,819
companies collapsing and whatnot you

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
might think that that would lead to an

218
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,139
increase in homegrown but we just heard

219
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,538
what you said about their clamping down

220
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,120
on those laws whether it's backed by

221
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,978
stats or just sort of hunches do you

222
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,139
feel like over the past year more people

223
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:23,939
have started home grow or do you think

224
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,439
more and more people are relying on the

225
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,779
rec Market

226
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,639
so the people I know think the wreckmark

227
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,318
is a joke you know what I mean how do

228
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,120
you make a joke oh let's smoke this

229
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,278
wreck weed here I'm gonna get so much

230
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,299
higher no that's not that's not the way

231
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,759
it works

232
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,958
um and so yeah our sales are up from

233
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,418
last year because because of my

234
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,458
excellent customer service or my shining

235
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:45,958
his personality but uh but sales are

236
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,579
definitely up than they were last year

237
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,039
definitely people are growing home home

238
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,420
at more growing at home more

239
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,679
um nobody wants to pay the right prices

240
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,120
and nobody knows where that [ __ ] came

241
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,739
from they can grow their own and grow it

242
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,480
for cheaper so they're gonna do it all

243
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,680
you need especially with Autos coming to

244
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,659
the play now all you need is a tent

245
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,519
light and you're good to go under 500

246
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,879
bucks you can get set up set up

247
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,879
that's it right Autos are really taken

248
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,159
off especially with the Advent of new

249
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,159
breeders and whatnot are there any auto

250
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,899
breeders who you're keeping your eye on

251
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,059
I don't let out my secrets but I will

252
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,639
tell you about my additions uh recently

253
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,559
brought on gas Reaper he's been doing it

254
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,319
out of Michigan and Ohio for the last 10

255
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,079
years he's got a string called D's runts

256
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,879
which is pretty awesome

257
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
um he's got you know of course he got a

258
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,759
big drop uh as soon as we got it you

259
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,899
sold out on the first weekend we're

260
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,299
looking to get restocked on that right

261
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:39,120
now but um but no you know he was he

262
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,399
gives Craig to me festo I've got another

263
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
gentleman I work with in wholesale that

264
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,059
does bigger amounts bulk like ten

265
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,060
thousand twenty thousand kilos you know

266
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,679
two kilos of beans at a time doing autos

267
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,778
and knocking out of the park too so

268
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,699
those will all be coming our way I'm not

269
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,500
gonna buy a kilo but I've talked to that

270
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,180
breeder about buying less quantities and

271
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,980
put him in the best ghost packaging so

272
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,000
we'll probably check for those after the

273
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,459
first

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,039
there you go everyone stay tuned I know

275
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,500
that for the longest time I was getting

276
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,539
messages from people being like you know

277
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,360
mephisto's out of stock who do I buy

278
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:14,219
whose orders do I buy and for a minute

279
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,600
there it was kind of hard to give him a

280
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,420
good answer but I think you've just

281
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,759
given us a nice one no exactly that was

282
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,860
my same my same problem was that I

283
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,720
thought you know that I at the time

284
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,399
Professor was the best in the industry

285
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,500
you know I called him one city you guys

286
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,659
just need to scale how can I help you

287
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,679
know and uh because we were just you

288
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,240
know as soon as we get them they would

289
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,799
fly out and that's the same thing you

290
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,360
know I if I didn't have a festival and

291
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,740
stuff people ask me who else it's like I

292
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,539
I don't really want to tell you somebody

293
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,459
else because I'm not really comfortable

294
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,480
or you know that confident as I was in

295
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,919
the festival I'd rather give him a

296
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,039
festival if I had it and I really have a

297
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:49,259
second but now you know those Industries

298
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,939
changed the last couple years and

299
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,200
um these guys have worked with the

300
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,040
festival before use a couple of their

301
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,160
males in a couple projects uh but

302
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,480
uh yeah I mean uh

303
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,100
investors are still great but you know

304
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,720
there's other people are going to come

305
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,420
up as well

306
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,639
yeah of course well

307
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,500
speaking about that I think this might

308
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,740
be a nice little segue into our first

309
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,200
award which is hottest newcomer on the

310
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,940
scene before we get into that I want to

311
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,740
say this will this will segment nicely I

312
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,240
think but I want to thank you and your

313
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,100
audience for having me on and doing

314
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,778
these shows with me I you make me feel

315
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,159
like a superstar out here when you do

316
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,019
these interviews with a little with a

317
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,699
little bean trailer so I appreciate you

318

320
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,440
appreciate that and uh I have to make

321
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,419
retraction

322
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,300
um I may have said in a couple of shows

323
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,979
here or there most likely so uh that I

324
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,719
wasn't you know thrilled on Jungle boys

325
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,039
gear I was like you know those guys are

326
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,778
Growers they're not breeders I wouldn't

327
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,939
I don't know if I should buy them I'm

328
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:49,519
gonna retract that statement and say

329
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,440
that even though I don't sell them yet

330
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,600
uh their gear is good yeah you should

331
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,160
get it I've had multiple people uh run

332
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,000
it and tell me if there's multiple

333
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,379
Keepers per pack so uh I retracted any

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
negative so what I say about that

335
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,439
because I don't want to mislead anybody

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,899
even though I don't sell it I do think

337
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,519
it's it's quality geared again so

338
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,278
thank you sir

339
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,959
no I mean thank you likewise for always

340
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,759
supporting the show we love having you

341
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,039
on and gaining the insights and

342
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,778
obviously really really appreciate how

343
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,578
you get behind the show and help us to

344
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,259
make episodes happen and more

345
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:24,659
importantly you know as a sign of

346
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,700
Integrity that you're willing to you

347
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,439
know kind of go back and say look you

348
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,259
know reevaluated I think these guys are

349
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,760
actually doing a good job and uh maybe

350
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,539
we'll talk about them a little more down

351
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:39,958
the track so yeah maybe maybe well timed

352
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:44,819
uh so let's jump into the first award

353
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:47,699
which is hottest newcomer on the scene I

354
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,579
remember that last year this award was

355
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,759
actually won by none other than AK Bean

356
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:55,679
Brands our friend on the final frontier

357
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:58,139
and he's had a pretty busy year again

358
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,799
this year but we're making a way for the

359
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,259
new blood so I'd love to ask what's your

360
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,838
prediction who in your mind is the

361
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,539
hottest newcomer on the scene

362
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,399
well I think that uh there's definitely

363
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:15,000
some some new guys that I've gotten you

364
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,159
know uh you mentioned uh Envy of course

365
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,720
um or uh mentioned big mace you know

366
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,838
Bloom could possibly in that category

367
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,339
for me it's got to be Soul fire

368
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,260
um and I've been working with him for

369
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,560
you know about two three years now but

370
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:31,860
the guys just uh he's really passionate

371
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,659
he's really legit he had a uh a drop set

372
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,300
for this winter I remember because I was

373
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:38,159
in uh in Oregon and um

374
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,419
he was gonna drop it we had the media

375
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,319
all done he's ready to go with it and

376
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,519
then he called me he's like you know

377
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,959
what I don't I don't think it's ready

378
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,919
yet he's like I've had some testers I'm

379
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,479
not so sure I don't think I'm gonna

380
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,019
release it I think we're gonna just

381
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,278
scrap it and rework the line that's it

382
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,720
it's up to you I said you know you build

383
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,159
your record it takes you five years to

384
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,259
build your reputation and it takes you

385
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,639
five minutes to kill it and so I think

386
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,958
that's a smart idea and sure enough he

387
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,339
decided to scrap the whole line just

388
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,799
because it wasn't going to be it wasn't

389
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,839
up to his his standard and so he

390
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,879
scrapped it and uh started again and you

391
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,360
know he released that Don Mega line uh

392
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,799
later on in the year and was been you

393
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,659
know gangbusters

394
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,059
flew out really really well he did some

395
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,159
nice stuff in the community as well so I

396
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,599
like still fires really good guy hanging

397
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,919
out with exotic

398
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,320
um Sharon Cuts you know we've got

399
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,379
they've got great stuff so yeah

400
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,480
I think I will 100 agree with you the

401
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,700
winner of this year's hottest newcomer

402
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,278
to the scene is indeed sulfur genetics

403
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,320
he has had an insanely big year he

404
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:36,539
caught my eye very early on in the year

405
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,540
when I was browsing the seeds here in

406
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:42,419
our website and I saw all of the Yu

407
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:43,980
jelly fans hit and I mean the first

408
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,259
thing that caught my eye about that was

409
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,539
the fact that he had such lovely photos

410
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,159
and specimens of all of the plants grown

411
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:52,319
out which I think we've discussed in the

412
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,519
past is generally a sign of a good

413
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,500
breeder if they're going to show you

414
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,000
photos of the grown progeny of what

415
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,759
they're trying to sell you that's just

416
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,059
like great first off the bat and so yeah

417
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,980
the why you jelly was caught my eye and

418
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,259
then I did a little digging and found

419
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,480
that it used gelato and the Don Mega

420
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,458
mail which makes sense as you reference

421
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,940
he had a great year with Don Mega which

422
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:18,059
is the really cool uh GMO Black Banana

423
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,940
hybrid so you know pretty popular stuff

424
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:24,479
all around and then he went even further

425
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,440
had his runs release which you know one

426
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,000
of the few breeders who bred with runs

427
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,980
the banana runs that stuff flew out of

428
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,720
the place it was hot give us some

429
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,278
perspective on the banana runs how'd

430
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,379
that go on did that just melt down the

431
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,698
servers for you guys yeah pretty much it

432
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,379
was gone on the first day I do believe

433
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:41,819
it went super fast you only had a

434
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,500
limited amount of them

435
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,940
um I guess runs doesn't uh I'm not sure

436
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,339
doesn't put off a ton of a ton of

437
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,079
Offspring sort of thing but uh but no

438
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,500
yeah they came and they went for sure

439
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:55,019
fastly very fast yeah he had gotten his

440
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,299
drop out after Exotica his first runs

441
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,179
dropped out before exotic second wrench

442
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,740
drop which was even before I think the

443
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,578
runs crew got theirs out because they

444
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,519
did a collab with uh

445
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:11,278
uh was it they would collab with

446
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,320
so I think runs had some seeds they sold

447
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,939
that were just runt seeds and then

448
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,100
they've also currently got a collab in

449
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,019
the works with compound genetics that's

450
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,579
such a worse compound but you could call

451
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,839
that was compounded

452
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,059
oh

453
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,920
I don't know funny story I guess I guess

454
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,599
the compound I guess the runs guy is

455
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,099
called one of my breeders are like hey

456
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,699
are you gonna pay me for that it's just

457
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,699
hung up on them

458
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,120
the days was a scam or something he

459
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,060
didn't give a [ __ ] he was hung up on him

460
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,299
and that was funny uh that's that's an

461
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:44,039
interesting tactic for sure yeah but uh

462
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,419
but yeah that's where exactly went

463
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,980
really hot with him I think he got he

464
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:48,719
got the the jump on them so to say like

465
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,759
before there was runs in seed form he

466
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,600
had his out and craft stop out with it

467
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,159
and

468
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,019
I don't know how they would put out

469
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,019
seeds they is there a mail runs

470
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,979
um no as far as I know all the runts

471
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,659
releases have been famed

472
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,818
there was a bit of Whispers going around

473
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,939
about maybe this was just a failed crop

474
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:10,379
and they seeded the whole place and uh

475
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,880
that's where these seeds came from

476
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,740
because there wasn't a lot of discussion

477
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,199
about the production of these seeds they

478
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,539
just kind of appeared one day and they

479
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,539
were what are they 700 a pack I know

480
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:23,159
there were a few people who were

481
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,720
very very uh had some opinions about

482
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,919
that I didn't even know they were

483
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,298
selling them but no that's something I

484
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,799
tell something I've had to tell breeders

485
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,298
in the past it's like you know just

486
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,039
because you [ __ ] up your room doesn't

487
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,480
mean you're a seed reader like that

488
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,099
doesn't give you rights to put them in

489
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,660
packaging and sell it like just scrap

490
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,699
the crop and try to blast it but don't

491
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,779
don't try to be super and I don't know

492
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,880
the story because I haven't watched but

493
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,759
that's always my question is is there if

494
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,980
they did it on purpose there's a mail

495
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,319
if it's a love child uh Happy Lucky

496
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,579
there's not a male because if you had a

497
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,139
male run she'd be breeding with that

498
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:53,220
you'd have that hitting everything and

499
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,480
you'd have that in the position to be

500
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,519
able to lock that thing down and get it

501
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,380
towards you could be only yours to keep

502
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,298
that mail and coveted him but if there's

503
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,919
an S1 running around or runs cut running

504
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:03,179
around that you can't protect that you

505
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,679
can't keep the weight on that as soon as

506
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,360
the mom's gone they're all gone and

507
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,840
everybody has it

508
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,240
yeah exactly exactly it's

509
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,459
it's another one of those things where

510
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,500
you know until we see the mail it's hard

511
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,100
to know what's going down but to jump

512
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,960
back to uh the man of the hour Soul fire

513
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,298
um you know done incredible work with

514
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,940
the runs with the Don Mega and he's even

515
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,220
done some some cool collab projects I

516
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,340
know that a good buddy of mine the north

517
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,960
fire has done a collab with him using um

518
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:37,079
here's the northern fire cookies cut

519
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,019
across to the Don Mega mail and we also

520
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:43,019
have the very altruistic cross done by

521
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,279
Soul fire being the free the Duke and

522
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,319
I'd love to get a little bit more

523
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,519
details from you about the back story on

524
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,339
that one

525
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,139
so uh he had called me out this is after

526
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,819
Duke had you know I'd put the stuff out

527
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,820
about Duke he was like hey I got got

528
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,139
this unreleased uh strain that I want to

529
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,240
put out and you know I wanted all the

530
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,038
money to go to Duke I said hey no

531
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,579
problem so he sent me 100 packs we

532
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:08,579
listed them for 100 bucks uh and I cut

533
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,259
Duke's wife a check for 10 grand at the

534
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,178
beginning of December yeah so that's

535
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:15,000
that's the only that he's willing to

536
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:17,100
donate one of his unreleased strains for

537
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,500
you know charitable causes I think that

538
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:22,379
just helps to back why we selected him

539
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,980
as this year's winner and as uh sort of

540
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:28,620
runner-up I'm gonna give it to MV

541
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,960

the scene this year come out with some

543
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,079

555
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,259
this year

556
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,679
um you know he would probably be one of

557
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,779
my seed bank sites you know uh best

558
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,000
newcomer of the year but I've had so far

559
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:13,500
for a couple years now but uh but it was

560
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
a really good guy he has a lot of people

561
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,400
testing his gear so we provide a lot of

562
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,380
pictures we've said before picture sells

media talk to all his customers and

566
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,840
that's what they want they want their

567
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,359
interaction with the guy that says hey

568

if this happens how do I fix it so good

569
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,379

571

573
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,580
want to flood the market again but to me

574
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,019
what I'm seeing a lot of right now is

575
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:44,639
Gary Payton

576
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:46,679
for next year Australia and uh yeah and

577
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,660
uh an Envy just had a drop with a

578
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,179
strange he called The Glove

579
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,320
which is a Gary Payton cross and yeah I

580
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,059
joke about that too I was like you must

581
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,678

prize I just want to give a few quick

597
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:38,279
little honorable shout outs I put a poll

598
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,038
up on Instagram about two weeks ago just

599
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:44,158
kind of gauging the community's thoughts

600
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,019
on this and a sentiment that was

601
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,900
commonly echoed that I wholeheartedly

602
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,658
jumped behind is ABF always be flowering

603
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,980
he got a lot of notable mentions

604
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,780
particularly he did some work with runs

605
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,240
this year doing some interesting crosses

606
00:21:54,779 --> 00:22:00,538
one called The Patriot cush really

607
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,980
caught my attention TK cross to runs you

608
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:03,298
know just looking at the names on the

609
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,480
pack you could expect something pretty

610
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:08,579
Fire coming out of that likewise we had

611
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,558
a surprising number of people who voted

612
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,240
for AK Bean Brands again but he won it

613
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,599
last year so I don't think he can be the

614
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,919
newcomer again

615
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,079
you'll only get that your first year at

616
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,600
least your first big year yeah your

617
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,178
first big year so yeah shout out to AKB

618
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,579
and brand still doing well and uh

619
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,780
another person who got a lot of

620
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:31,139
mentioned so I wanted to give a shout

621
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,700
out to was uh J trees and skunk tech for

622
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,100
their work with the black Cuban Hayes

623
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,840
hopefully those crosses will be released

624
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,359
in the near future they're unavailable

625
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,859
at the moment I don't think any seed

626
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,359
banks they're still testing them but a

627
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,459
lot of people are keeping their eyes on

628
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,099
that so shout out to Jay trees and skunk

629
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,600
Tech as well any honorable mentions you

630
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,178
want to throw out there

631
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,798
yeah I don't know if it's uh if it's too

632
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,080
early yet it might be it might be still

633
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,639
a sleeper but uh Bloom has been has been

634
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,699
good for us I I really believe in that

635
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,220
guy's work he used to be with Oni noodle

636
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,080
so it's uh it's Terry Palms is is Bloom

637
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,179
now and he's putting out some really

638
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,319
good gear that we've got a hold of and I

639
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,700
think he's doing good things but it

640
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,839
might be still too early for him so if

641
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,140
you're sleeping on him go pick up his

642
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:16,079
packs but if not maybe next year

643
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,900
yeah no I actually did see quite a few

644
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,798
people suggest Bloom and I was

645
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,419
admittedly a little behind the eight

646
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,298
ball on that one and was scratching my

647
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,919
head thinking who is this Bloom Seed Co

648
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:29,279
um but after doing a bit of researching

649
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,759
that all makes sense to Harry Palms

650
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,619
um so on to the next award for this year

651
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,240
which I think we're gonna piggyback

652
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,038
based on what you said earlier where you

653
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,079
were predicting Gary Payton to be a

654
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,119
clone of the Year let's talk about this

655
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,000
year's hottest clone of the year there's

656
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,558
been a few sites such as Leafly and

657
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,839
strain Lee you know like some of the

658
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,519
more mainstream cannabis websites that

659
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,339
have already come out and declared it

660
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:56,038
the year of the runs and I hate to be a

661
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:58,019
wet blanket but we kind of declared it

662
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:00,119
last year we were ahead of the curve my

663
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,099
friend kind of that was kind of a call

664
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,899
last year but you know social media is

665
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,980
always going to be the big media players

666
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,360
who aren't in the game we're always

667
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,159
going to be at your behind you know it's

668
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,319
us kind of guys who are on the bleeding

669
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,620
edge if you will train to be

670
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,839
keeping up with everything yeah but I

671
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:18,178
mean runs absolutely crushed at this

672
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,038
year obviously it went from strength to

673
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,620
strength although we could see last year

674
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,839
it was already on a momentous upswing

675
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:28,199
it's continued to do so and I think if

676
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:30,298
nothing else it shows the value of good

677
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,919
Marketing in this industry and I think

678
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:34,139
even if there are breeders you don't

679
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,759
personally like if they're marketing

680
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,980
well you've got something you can learn

681
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,259
from them because as the runs crew have

682
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,480
shown they're not necessarily breeders

683
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:45,599
in their own right but by God if they've

684
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,339
kind of taken it out this year so it's

685
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,319
like every every pair of breeders

686
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:50,639
whenever we have a two-piece it's not

687
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,158
people are really

688
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,419
um defied that the statement is going to

689
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,340
be the swan boys they've covered

690
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,740
together but uh every other two-piece

691
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:00,418
breeder pack that has pair has split up

692
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,579
and they haven't done well and they you

693
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,799
know um there's usually a hype guy and a

694
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:06,538
guy with the with with the passion

695
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,460
there's a guy making all the noise and

696
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,259
yelling and every other two piece I've

697
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,579
had to split up but uh but they haven't

698
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,179
and so

699
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,819
um

700
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,700
uh what the [ __ ] doing with that the

701
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:19,939
importance of marketing marketing uh no

702
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,380
no marketing okay

703
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,240
so there's always that hype guy that can

704
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,799
work on the marketing and and get out

705
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,120
there and beat on the bullhorn and be

706
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:30,119
pushing and pushing pushing it while the

707
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,798
guy with the passion is in the in in the

708
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,719
uh in the garage doing the work and

709
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,759
doing the breeding you know so marketing

710
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,620
is huge just like you know next year

711
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,480
what I called next to Australia it's got

712
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,739
It's cookie fan like they they didn't

713
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,298
even do that [ __ ] in the first place and

714
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,220
then got huge marketing behind them they

715
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:45,599
push you know burner burner gives a lot

716
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,339
of credit to his first marketing guy he

717
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,939
was no longer with him but you know that

718
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:52,199
that crate is due um they you know how

719
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,659
they can even still operate after Candy

720
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,580
Rain I don't understand but you know uh

721
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,500
they have great marketing and and Gary

722
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,579
Payton's also going to be a big thing I

723
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,400
think

724
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:04,740
yeah that I think that that will get

725
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,538
some more traction as well but to jump

726
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,940
back to it so unfortunately although

727
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:11,099
runs has crushed it this year kind of

728
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,558
won last year so I want to give it to

729
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:15,778
something else this year and there has

730
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,639
been another strain that has popped up

731
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:20,880
in my feed almost every time I go on

732
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,919
Instagram and it's been worked with by

733
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,380
some really cool people out there most

734
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,940
notably the Josh D crew has done really

735
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,799
well with the strain I'm about to

736
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,558
mention I'm thinking that might be

737
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,079
enough to give it away already but I'd

738
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:36,240
love to hear your thoughts first what do

739
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,220
you think is worthy of the title of

740
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,700
hottest strain or hottest clone of the

741
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,919
year for this year not including runs it

742
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,500
just out of sales wise I would think

743
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,940
it'd have to be like a gelato just

744
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,400
another one of those sweet kind of

745
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,919
things that I've seen a good push on as

746
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,720
far as what I call hype trainer you know

747
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,880
I don't

748
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,100
um I don't know I'm intrigued by you

749
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,140
over Sarah I'm intrigued what do you got

750
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,359
yeah I think you're pretty well on the

751
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,820
money with your gelato prediction gelato

752
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,699
is still one of the biggest components

753
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:10,859
in any breeders sort of recipe and some

754
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,440
people might have thought I was alluding

755
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,119
to like a Josh dog sort of thing

756
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,220
mentioning that he's done well with it

757
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,158
but last year at the emerald Cup in fact

758
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:23,880
Josh D and his crew won the indoor award

759
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:27,000
for ice cream cake and boy have I seen

760
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,700
ice cream cake absolutely crush it in

761
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,460
the wreck Market this past year I think

762
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,679
that among the Casual enthusiasts I have

763
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,960
seen more people hyped about this strain

764
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,720
trying to buy it than almost anything

765
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,360
else have you had any interaction with

766
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,400
the ice cream cake at all

767
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,139
so you blew me away there uh I didn't

768
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,640
know that Josh D and his guys did that I

769
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,740
thought that was going to be you know a

770
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,720
wedding cake thing from bz

771
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,339
um because I I worked with it but uh but

772
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,259
yeah no I've seen that one a ton of

773
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:58,319
times now you mentioned it and if I'm if

774
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:00,179
I'm just some uh just a casual wreck

775
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,918
buyer I want you're buying weed and see

776
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,179
something that says ice cream cake I'm

777
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,320
gonna grab it you know what I mean I

778
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,580
want that [ __ ] they want to see if it

779
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,658
tastes I just want to see if it tastes

780
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:08,879
like I should pick in the first place

781
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:11,580
and if it does great everything if it

782
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,980
doesn't I still bought it so um and

783
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,879
Dusty is a good guy I love that guy I

784
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,740
didn't know he was he was a guy

785
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,299
responsible for it but yeah definitely

786
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,159
we've seen that one around

787
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:22,079
um it's not

788
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,120
so it kind of goes back to cuts that are

789
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,319
held too tightly but I don't see a lot

790
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,079
of people other people breeding with it

791
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,000
or working with a uh

792
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,960
like the like the restaurant like the

793
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,179
gelato by might Beach because they're

794
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,558
not letting go of it I'm not sure but I

795
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,419
don't see as many crosses as you think

796
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,399
with it but I know it's been a great

797
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:40,440
strain

798
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,360
yeah well I mean when you're right

799
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,759
you're right I uh I hope I didn't

800
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,918
mislead anyone there in that you're

801
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,519
correct the ice cream cake wasn't made

802
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,980
by Josh D it was made by exactly who you

803
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,720
predicted jbz

804
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,240
um so yeah it's a cross of wedding cake

805
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,278
and gelato 33 which is interesting

806
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,339
because normally you see people reading

807
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:06,659
with the 41. a little more but cool

808
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:07,740
stuff has come from the 33 and uh most

809
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,080
recently I've seen a lot of cool stuff

810
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,200
come out of the 41.

811
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,960
yes which I think is a probably my

812
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,759
favorite but yeah you're correct um Jay

813
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,159
Beasley killed it with this breeding

814
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,140
it's just mostly Josh D who's done well

815
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,940
promoting it from what I've seen and

816
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,659
helping get some momentum behind that

817
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,179
one

818
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:30,778
great and it's kind of like the uh like

819
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:32,340
archives one star the lemon peel he

820
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:35,339
didn't he didn't do it he doesn't say he

821
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:38,220
did uh TR Rojo did he just he just found

822
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,199
the phenotype so you know what you know

823
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,519
there's lots of beans come out of single

824
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,220
breeding and it takes people to pop up

825
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,200
to find good stuff yeah that's it right

826
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,079
and something which has made me think

827
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,058
about is that ice cream cake you know

828
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,398
the blending of gelato and wedding cake

829
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:55,079
it's it's a great strain not trying to

830
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:57,959
detract from that but it is working

831
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:00,480
within similar sort of genetic fields

832
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,640
and it's got me wondering when the next

833
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,159
strain that comes along will take the

834
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,919
cake for being excuse the pun

835
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,899
um for being something just utterly

836
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,640
different and I think that you know last

837
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,619
year we said that the strainer of the

838
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,380
year was Mac because you know the Clone

839
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:18,538
was just absolutely mopping up everybody

840
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,159
who could get their hands on it and I

841
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,319
think that kind of fits the bill to an

842
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,760
extent but it does beg the question of

843
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,798
when we're going to see something just

844
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,898
utterly left of field to the sort of

845
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,538
cookie genetics which have dominated so

846
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:32,339
heavily over the past few years

847
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:34,140
yes I think that that would definitely

848
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:36,480
be it and I'm I'm of course pulling for

849
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,299
a land race something where something

850
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,679
old something new to the current people

851
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:42,119
that buy but something that the old

852
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,940
heads have known and loved for a while

853
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:48,359
so it gets play from both sides

854
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,220
yeah and my little little tidbit to that

855
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:51,719
which I can totally get behind in terms

856
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,019
of wanting to see some land race stuff

857
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,620
if anyone's keen on some crazy uh

858
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:01,139
Southeast Asian sort of weed uh the

859
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:04,739
forever amazing Bodhi has this

860
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,500
Vietnamese 33 or Vietnamese 32 I'll look

861
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,000
into whichever one it is but gosh I I

862
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,460
hope something comes of that I was lucky

863
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,099
enough to try some of that from him I

864
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,659
think two years ago now and still some

865
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:18,000
of the most memorable weed I've ever had

866
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,980
for those old heads looking for that old

867
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,200
Southeast Asian hitter

868
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,720
so explain it to me I don't I I didn't

869
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,880
but we didn't share any of that with me

870
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,440
so explain to me like what do you uh

871
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,059
what enticed you about it what did you

872
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,558
like what kept you going back to that

873
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:34,980
stream

874
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:39,119
uh it was like it was the first strain

875
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:42,480
I'd had in a very long time that just

876
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:45,119
made me that very stereotypical like

877
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,759
super giggly really happy really

878
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,678
uplifting it's like the sort of weed you

879
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,480
wish you could bring to a party where

880
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,980
like it's not going to make anyone sit

881
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,919
on the couch people are going to be more

882
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,419
up more dance and having fun joking it

883
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,820
was like everything they described Super

884
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:02,159
Silver Haze to be a bit just like better

885
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:03,480
nice I remember when I first got high

886
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,940
when I was uh I didn't start getting

887
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,339
hikes I was like 18 19 so I was probably

888
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,840
19 or 20 with my roommate he looked at

889
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:11,519
me he's like I wish I could get that

890
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,519
high man I wish I could get that high

891
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,839
still you know so maybe some of that

892
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:17,038
kind of you know that early stuff but

893
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,459
yeah

894
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:23,940
yeah for reals and just as like a little

895
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:26,038
side note uh this year I took a fair few

896
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,200
different sort of Tolerance breaks at

897
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:30,179
various points for various reasons some

898
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,120
sort of work related some sort of just

899
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:35,460
you know personal uh you know challenges

900
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,139
I wanted to do and I tell you what I

901
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,120
took a two-week break from smoking when

902
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,980
I came back it was like getting high for

903
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,139
the first time so if anyone is like your

904
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,579
old roommate who's really missing it I

905
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,440
know it can be tough but I tell you what

906
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:47,939
you go two weeks or so without smoking

907
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,759
you come back you are gonna have to

908
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,620
strap yourself in

909
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,440
yeah I probably go back to joints it

910
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,699
wasn't my fault but uh but yeah I don't

911
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,679
know if I could last the whole two weeks

912
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,880
things you know especially being in my

913
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,440
house by myself I don't know if I could

914
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,940
but I have to try it I'm gonna give that

915
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,278
a try for the first

916
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,679
yeah that's that's true this year

917
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,119
understandably people have been smoking

918
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,320
a little more but as long as they've

919
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,398
been smoking good that's what we're

920
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,058
hoping

921
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:18,058
yep nothing with no seeds no stamps

922
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:21,720
that's it so the next award we're gonna

923
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:26,220
move on to is most anticipated seed drop

924
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,500
for the coming year now last year we had

925
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,860
a few people in the mix for this one we

926
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,798
had uh Matt rides Blue Bonnet we had uh

927
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:38,099
Karma's sour in the mix we also had the

928
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,259
A5 Haze Femmes he was looking to do so

929
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,359
there was quite a diverse sort of range

930
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:44,519
of strains that were up in the air that

931
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,278
people were really excited about seeing

932
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,019
drop is there anything this year for the

933
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,460
coming year that's really caught your

934
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,140
eye that you're thinking is going to

935
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,100
make a big splash over the coming 12

936
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,019
months

937
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:57,538
well it's not it's not in the upcoming

938
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,519
year it just happened uh crazy enough

939
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,140
since you asked it happened Thursday on

940
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,538
my website but

941
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,120
um Humboldt Seed Company came out with

942
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:10,320
uh the Super Freak

943
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:13,138
so it's a it's a freak Show cross

944
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,580
um and and humble has been crushing it I

945
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,639
mean I think I did it like two years ago

946
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:20,460
and he's a good guy uh good gear Great

947
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,639
Park marketing great packaging

948
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,960
um but just uh uh of course freak Show

949
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,820
last year I guess it was at the

950
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,679
beginning of this year I'm not sure

951
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,619
um but that thing it's a it's a it's an

952
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,599
ABF I mean it's an Alaskan strange and

953
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:35,960
so it's it grows of course like a looks

954
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,960
like a fern

955
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,358
uh it's got that really like hyper

956
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,819
serrated Leaf doesn't it yeah yeah for

957
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:47,219
sure a very uh thinner looks like

958
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,359
yeah very firm like in fact when that

959
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,699
came out

960
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:52,799
um all the seeds were white and not just

961
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:54,118
a couple but like you across the board

962
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,679
because you can see them in his packs

963
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,358
they were all white

964
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,338
um and he had to make a post on on

965
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,900
Instagram that said you know it's it

966
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:02,159
don't send them back usually white means

967
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,380
immature but these are not immature

968
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,618
they're just fine uh just give them

969
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,599
they're supposed to be white so there

970
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:12,300
you go yeah I always I love it how you

971
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,640
know some strains produce really unique

972
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,760
seeds and I remember a while back we

973
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,379
were speaking to gooey gooey breeder and

974
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,480
he mentioned that you know some of his

975
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,820
African strains produce seeds that are

976
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,039
pitch black like no tiger stripes just

977
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,619
straight black and so I guess it goes to

978
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,599
show when you consider the uh the super

979
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,420
freak you just mentioned the diversity

980
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:36,059
of phenotypes within seeds

981
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,280
yes uh super freak Chrysler freak Show

982
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,679
and it's that's a super freak but

983
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,060
um yeah it's it's definitely I think

984
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,379
we're going to see a lot more of that as

985
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:45,539
more

986
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,280
different strains come to light so I say

987
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:48,179
like I I you know I still think we're

988
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,560
definitely going to find a lot of

989
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,480
additional stuff and some of that Asian

990
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,099
stuff some that Thai stuff some of those

991
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,740
terpenes I think that they haven't

992
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,260
really uh had the luxury of going into a

993
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:00,059
sequencing machine or something that

994
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,200
says what Terps is going to produce but

995
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:06,838
uh you know definitely no

996
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,939
yeah okay that's a that's a great

997
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,039
suggestion I hadn't heard too much about

998
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,019
that from the fans but I had been

999
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,579
following it on Instagram so that's cool

1000
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:16,500
to see it's getting some traction and

1001
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:18,119
people can now go and grab it so

1002
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,559
everyone you know where to head to to

1003
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,099
pick that one up

1004
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:26,699
so in terms of what I had been keeping

1005
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,500
my eye on I had uh two things which

1006
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,059
really caught my eye and then I also you

1007
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,219
know threw the question out to the fans

1008
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:35,099
on Instagram to kind of get a bit of a

1009
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:37,199
gauge on what they were thinking and we

1010
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:40,019
had three things come up pretty

1011
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,639
consistently uh two of them I was

1012
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:44,099
especially hyped for but one of them the

1013
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,139
fans were especially hyped for the for

1014
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,180
me the one I'm most waiting in

1015
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,559
anticipation to see and I know that some

1016
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:53,460
people are probably going to think that

1017
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:56,820
I've invoked some bad juju on myself for

1018
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,579
saying this but the res dog sour IBL

1019
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,820
we've seen him posting packs of the

1020
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,200
newest release that he's just created I

1021
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,059
don't believe they're for sale yet

1022
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:07,739
except for through maybe one friend he

1023
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,179
has if you happen to bump into that guy

1024
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,799
in person I haven't been following

1025
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:13,618
enough to really be able to follow that

1026
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,780
however he seems to have made the newest

1027
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,780
release of this sour d IBL looks like

1028
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,540
he's just got a cut of the sour had some

1029
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,099
of the old our iblcs found a male

1030
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,019
crossed it taking it to the next

1031
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,519
Generation have you heard much about

1032
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:28,500
that at all

1033
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,199
well so I'm sure you've talked with your

1034
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,900
audience but we know sour d is a bag

1035
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,939
seed from Kennedy right

1036
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,920
yeah I mean it's definitely bag seed

1037
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,539
from chem right I think the more I try

1038
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,220
to dig into it the more I'm less sure

1039
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,219
about what it is

1040
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:49,199
yeah well uh well actually so uh Mojave

1041
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:51,779
had the the guy on uh Sarah silica on

1042
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,159
um on a different podcast and uh he came

1043
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,540
out the guy who did it

1044
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,578
um and said that yeah it was just

1045
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,739
kidding Doug Banks and so that was kind

1046
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,960
of to have a clarifying from Mojave some

1047
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:04,139
Hobbies is basically Adam Dunn's brother

1048
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,900
uh who's the guy who created Sage

1049
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:09,420
um and works the Big Sir holy weed uh

1050
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,980
extremely vetted very very old school as

1051
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,440
far as strange go

1052
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,500
um and so for him to come out and and

1053
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,880
put his his Mark so to say on on uh

1054
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,960
Sarah silk it was kind of you know

1055
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,099
because he had met him back in the day

1056
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,960
they'd come to Amsterdam with it at

1057
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,940
first and blow an Amsterdam away with it

1058
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,838
so yeah so that was It was kind of out

1059
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,400
there

1060
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,460
um

1061
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,680
I could I get stoned where were we

1062
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,079
yeah no that's that's brilliant to hear

1063
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,179
that it's been vouched for by Mojave I I

1064
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,980
actually heard Bodhi speak quite highly

1065
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,960
of him as well so that's that's cool to

1066
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,179
hear two corroborating stories I guess

1067
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,400
the aspect I'm most interested in is do

1068
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:46,980
you think this newest edition of the

1069
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,079
sour IBL from res will do well or do you

1070
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,838
think the negative stigma that a lot of

1071
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,579
people feel hangs over his head will

1072
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,880
continue and that would draw people away

1073
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:59,400
from buying it my hunch is that although

1074
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,980
a lot of people are quite suspicious of

1075
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,780
res dog's history many of these same

1076
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,519
people will tell you that some of his

1077
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,560
work was the best they've ever seen and

1078
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:11,838
I think when push comes to shove people

1079
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,838
will buy the packs what's your thoughts

1080
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,240
uh I think I stay away from from things

1081
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,400
that cause me drama maybe and that quite

1082
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,679
quite uh just made possible some drama

1083
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,820
but you know he had his history I know

1084
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,679
somebody that's still in contact with

1085
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,660
him he had he had spoke about possibly

1086
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,460
dropping through my bank and we had

1087
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:31,559
talked to him about some or talked to

1088
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,059
this this friend in between us about

1089
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,900
about coming back

1090
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,219
um

1091
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,260
you know a lot of people are claiming

1092
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:38,519
sours and so if women have a sour IBL

1093
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,160
coming back off you know whatever

1094
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,320
whatever happened this or that will you

1095
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,239
know it's it's me as a [ __ ] social

1096
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,920
media is a [ __ ] and so they will I

1097
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,259
think that you know he'll have people

1098
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,400
that will still say things of him or

1099
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,079
they'll always be out there he has to

1100
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
completely change his name for him to do

1101
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,260
anything positive I think I don't know

1102
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,599
there's just too much out there that I I

1103
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,820
wasn't there for I I don't know but I

1104
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,440
just do know the amount of things that

1105
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,079
are said on one side or the other and

1106
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,480
it's you know it can be equally said but

1107
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,859
uh it's just a lot of talk and there's

1108
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,420
that much talk about a negative thing

1109
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:11,578
it's never good

1110
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,920
so I don't know

1111
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:16,440
yeah of course and it's understandable

1112
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,420
that people might be quite hesitant to

1113
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,579
get involved given that some of the

1114
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,920
allegations revolve around like police

1115
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:25,019
and stuff like that but

1116
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,680
um yeah it's it's hard to it's hard to

1117
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:29,460
give definitive rulings I guess yeah and

1118
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,078
as far as that though I mean if

1119
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,280
Australians fire it's fire like you're

1120
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,560
going to come to it it's gonna it's

1121
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,119
gonna draw you in it'll be unstoppable

1122
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,159
like it's something you're going to open

1123
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,539
the jar for and so if it's that kind of

1124
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,239
if it's that kind of strain you know

1125
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:43,858
people may rename or do this or that but

1126
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,439
you know what then I think it'll sell

1127
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,539
them and be good but I think you know uh

1128
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,400
but you know the cannabis plants talk

1129
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:51,659
you know who there are some people that

1130
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,559
I don't agree with the Breeders that I

1131
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:54,420
don't agree with we don't have the same

1132
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,400
set of opinions on things but is your

1133
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,200
gear bad no I picked them up for a

1134
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,940
reason I'm not wrong that often so they

1135
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,618
still make great stuff I'm just not

1136
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,300
thrilled with them you know and that

1137
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,980
could be the that could be the stuff

1138
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,740
about res you know and like I said I

1139
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,940
wasn't there I don't know but um but

1140
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:10,618
with the strange fires you're gonna

1141
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,039
you're gonna smoke it

1142
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:17,099
yeah yeah I think that Karma kind of put

1143
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,440
out a statement of sort of similar tone

1144
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,180
when he said you know look my sour bx2

1145
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,179
it's based off a sour I found in a pack

1146
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:25,500
of Rose dog's work you now know I'm not

1147
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:27,239
going to mention him anymore because I

1148
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,159
don't want to mention him so I think

1149
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:31,799
that that kind of speaks to that idea of

1150
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:35,219
like separating the individual from the

1151
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,940
art as some people would have said but

1152
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:41,159
on to the next choices we had two

1153
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,880
contenders that I think were kind of

1154
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:46,858
very closely following the sour IBL we

1155
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,960
had a lot of people including myself who

1156
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:51,900
had been tracking AK Bean brains who has

1157
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,800
done a reproduction of supposedly it's

1158
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,838
hard to vouch for certain supposedly

1159
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,300
authentic stock of Beatrix Choice from

1160
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,039
the super sativa seed Club have you

1161
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,760
heard about this or seen anything about

1162
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,980
it

1163
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,359
uh the sssc is legendary

1164
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,699
their packs are I believe they're like

1165
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,838
quarter quarter Savers which you put in

1166
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:15,059
a quarter pack it has like 10 little

1167
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:17,759
seeds in the middle it says sssc on that

1168
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:19,880
side uh pretty awesome uh that's where

1169
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,960
Vic High got his stuff um

1170
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,700
Beatrice choice I haven't heard of I

1171
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,740
mean I I know the strain I don't know

1172
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:27,358
what they're doing with it but um but no

1173
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:29,159
that should be awesome That's a classic

1174
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,739
so

1175
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:34,618
yeah I think a lot of people were put

1176
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:37,199
onto it after our second episode ever

1177
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,059
with skunk VA he spoke very fondly about

1178
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,059
it and I think that helped sort of

1179
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,739
reignite some of the uh the flames in

1180
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,980
the community about getting it back and

1181
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:49,559
so yeah AK Bean brands has been generous

1182
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,960
enough to do this reproduction in terms

1183
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,900
of he was got his hands on a pack of

1184
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,960
some um more what he's kind of known for

1185
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,119
the uh the the fabled freezer stock

1186
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,420
that's uh you know been in someone's

1187
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,160
freezer for a good 25 30 years and uh

1188
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,318
yeah it's it's hit some of the seed

1189
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,500
banks and so I think people are pretty

1190
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:13,800
excited about that it does however bring

1191
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,719
us to the final uh sort of honorable

1192
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,700
mention for the anticipated clone of the

1193
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,519
year or sorry anticipated strain of the

1194
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:23,519
year and this one has definitely got

1195
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,739
some uh some controversy around it but

1196
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:30,059
at the same time people are so Keen for

1197
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:33,598
it being that it is the swabi S1 seeds

1198
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:36,599
also more commonly just Pakistani land

1199
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,579
Ray seeds that come originally from

1200
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,579
Arizona

1201
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:43,800
of the Indian Land race team

1202
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,260
excellent interview by the way excellent

1203
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,700
interview that was very good thank you I

1204
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,000
like listening to it I learned a lot

1205
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:52,980
about that guy so sorry he's a pleasure

1206
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,539
to listen to isn't he yeah he was just

1207
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,039
you know in his passion you could just

1208
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:58,500
tell it like you know he had to grill

1209
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,699
this stuff they would SWAT him he had to

1210
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,219
go up here and get it from these people

1211
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:03,659
and you know just that the things he did

1212
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:05,338
to get where he was and you know they

1213
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:07,139
want especially like I can't imagine

1214
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:08,940
like how they would be in those type of

1215
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:10,500
countries that you know are definitely

1216
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,639
marijuana is not the not the greatest

1217
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,219
thing

1218
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:15,900
um but uh but yeah he was he he's yeah

1219
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:17,578
he's got a lot of hearts for the right

1220
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,900
reasons I think uh which sounds like a

1221
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:22,380
really good interview

1222
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,539
yeah he's a guy who I've never heard

1223
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,160
anyone talk a bad word about him he's uh

1224
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:28,619
he's a very passionate guy and we're

1225
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,059
very grateful for that but uh to jump

1226
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:32,579
back to it so you know he collected

1227
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:35,460
these land race Pakistani seeds he

1228
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:37,318
worked them for a generation or two and

1229
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,940
then he sent some to some friends and

1230
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:40,619
most notably he sent some to Mass

1231
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,200
medical strains who then did A

1232
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:46,619
reproduction of them only available in

1233
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:49,559
the feminized form where he crossed uh

1234
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:51,599
made some s ones as well as some uh sort

1235
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:54,440
of sister pairings where you know

1236
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,940
Crossing one swabby to its sister

1237
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,500
and I think that although there has been

1238
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,838
a little bit of controversy around this

1239
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,420
strain it's kind of come to fruition in

1240
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:05,279
the end in the sense that the seeds are

1241
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,380
being released to the public and all of

1242
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,519
the proceeds are going towards helping

1243
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,559
to fund a a library project

1244
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,559
um in sort of the area of the world

1245
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:18,838
where irisin is based and it very much

1246
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,719
sort of a an idea of that there's been

1247
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:23,818
being some sort of Charity or compassion

1248
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:27,000
side to the release of the seeds and not

1249
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:29,519
not being a sort of for-profit release

1250
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,280
to the market so yeah shout out to

1251
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,380
erizin and to Mass medical for getting

1252
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,960
those seeds out to the public they have

1253
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,519
dropped recently but no one's been able

1254
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,380
to finish flowering them out yet so I

1255
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:43,338
think people are very excited for what

1256
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:46,019
this level how many weeks does it take

1257
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:47,639
oh gosh I mean yeah some breeders and

1258
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,599
it's like just takes a week after you

1259
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:50,598
harvest the seeds right

1260
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:55,619
um yeah no so I think that some people

1261
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:57,239
would probably have maybe just flipped

1262
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,400
them I think they got released like four

1263
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:01,139
weeks ago or something around that but I

1264
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,760
know that there were a lot of people who

1265
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:04,078
were a bit bummed out when they found

1266
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,300
out they weren't going to be released

1267
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,339
which was the the sort of the story for

1268
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,260
a short period of time and then him and

1269
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:13,078
erizin were able to sort out a situation

1270
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,700
whereby the the proceeds of that sea

1271
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,180
drop would go towards building the

1272
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:19,739
library so that's a a good outcome in

1273
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:21,059
terms of what the alternative outcome

1274
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:24,239
would have been and a lot of people are

1275
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:27,599
excited about that thin Leaf Packy

1276
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,919
yeah uh I I didn't uh it got me a little

1277
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,180
bit by surprise I'll have to go look

1278
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,818
into it I didn't know he was releasing

1279
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:34,919
gear but uh but that once again it goes

1280
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:37,380
back to us saying earlier about it's

1281
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,358
different it's not the same cookie

1282
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,338
[ __ ] it's not the same genetics that

1283
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,380
are played over in milkshake it's

1284
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:45,000
different and just like the freak Show

1285
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,480
and just like the you know

1286
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,980
um the sour it's you know hey who knows

1287
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,420
the sour could be next year's big thing

1288
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,280
it's something that the new people like

1289
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,619
it's new to them but the old heads are

1290
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,940
like this this is really sour and if it

1291
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,740
is you know you can hit both of them and

1292
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,818
watch them be stranded here next year

1293
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,659
you know what I mean even though it's

1294
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:06,300
dead by Rez so uh

1295
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:07,679
so yeah uh it's it's different I think

1296
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,599
people are sick of the same thing that

1297
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:13,019
F1 Durban they've had enough of it you

1298
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:17,160
know yeah they want a fresh taste

1299
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:21,059
that's it so bringing us to the second

1300
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:23,279
last award clone Hall of Fame so last

1301
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:26,039
year Girl Scout cookie took the award

1302
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,319
for all of the mixed opinions and

1303
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,119
theories on cookies it has

1304
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,159
understandably stood the test of time

1305
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,619
and that was the given reason for why it

1306
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:37,799
made it into the Hall of Fame this year

1307
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:39,599
we're kind of taking a step back uh

1308
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,700
probably surprising to a lot of people

1309
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,900
that cookies made it in before this one

1310
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:49,199
given the the uh Grand following of it

1311
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,539
we have on this show but I am happy to

1312
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:55,578
say that this year's Hall of Fame clone

1313
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:58,259
is none other than the chemdog 91.

1314
00:47:55,579 --> 00:48:00,480
very nice very nice I'm sure Kim will be

1315
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,839
happy but yeah it's yeah

1316
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,599
it's also a just a a killer strain that

1317
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:08,219
has had multiple generational impact

1318
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:10,619
like

1319
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:13,618
um I was I was lucky enough camera uh

1320
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,579
two years ago Kim dog took me to see the

1321
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:17,579
great I've never seen the Grateful Dead

1322
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:19,859
Before Kim dog took me to uh to see them

1323
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:22,619
I was I was a kid to visit them didn't

1324
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:24,480
see them at the like 20 years to the day

1325
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:26,818
where he had seen them for his first

1326
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,400
time and he and we were meeting up with

1327
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:30,719
uh with Vicki Hart the the drummer and

1328
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,639
so we met up ahead of time because Kim

1329
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,858
dog did a release a collab with Mickey

1330
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:39,659
something called grateful and uh

1331
00:48:36,858 --> 00:48:42,358
they had like 10 Pinner joints in a camp

1332
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:45,059
and they're like pinners like you know

1333
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:46,500
not very big at all and uh Mickey said

1334
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,059
you know maybe on that shirt will make

1335
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,159
them a little bit bigger you know and I

1336
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:52,139
was like oh my God you can't go smaller

1337
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,338
so but uh that was a kid that anyone

1338
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:54,539
crossed with and I said you know there's

1339
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:57,480
I still think I said you know there's

1340
00:48:54,539 --> 00:49:00,539
you know the Kim D and the and the and

1341
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,119
the sis and what are those

1342
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:05,400
oh okay I'm not gonna get into that one

1343
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,500
uh but no it was really a pleasure to

1344
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,880
meet him and and his stories with Kim

1345
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,960
and how he'd been all over with it and

1346
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,400
you know

1347
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,280
and how it started kind of with their

1348
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,500
thing and so yeah it's been uh it's an

1349
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,819
awesome thing I think uh Greg you guys

1350
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,460
remember Greg did that [ __ ] he was like

1351
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:23,279
17 18 years old you know what I mean it

1352
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,599
wasn't uh yeah nobody was collecting

1353
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,640
seeds or growing [ __ ] back then they

1354
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,380
were just hustling them so

1355
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,960
that's it

1356
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,420
I mean undeniably you know the chem dog

1357
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,280
is the backbone of so many companies

1358
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,760
it's it's hard to count them and the

1359
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,980
Legacy that was started by mass G kemdog

1360
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,720
uh carried on by the New York crew

1361
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,480
before the torch was passed on to the

1362
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,759
man himself skunk VA for many years

1363
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,338
she's been the queen of modern cannabis

1364
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,260
that's redefined the meaning of potency

1365
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:54,599
and giving birth to countless strains

1366
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,280
countless clone onlys and just in

1367
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,700
general giving the public something to

1368
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,619
enjoy I think that it's undeniable that

1369
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:05,578
she's stood the test of time and still

1370
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:07,740
to this day puts many a grown man uh

1371
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:11,099
Green in the face and many modern Elites

1372
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:14,039
to shame in terms of its potency and to

1373
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,960
me she's what people refer to when they

1374
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,300
talk about the old school funk you know

1375
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,920
the older heads reminiscing about how

1376
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:23,039
they're dissatisfied with the current

1377
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,240
strains I think she's the one that

1378
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,719
they're thinking of when they're talking

1379
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,879
about the old school fire they remember

1380
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,858
and more importantly Lee she still gives

1381
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,838
birth to some of the most fire hybrids

1382
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:35,578
you see today have grown correctly I

1383
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,679
think that if you look at a bunch of

1384
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:40,680
skunk va's work he's done a bunch of

1385
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:43,679
chem 91 hybrids that are sure to sort of

1386
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,358
hit the spot and honor her properly and

1387
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,598
I think that you know that's a good way

1388
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,699
to pay homage to this strain is to to

1389
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,260
grow out work from breeders who are

1390
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,058
working with it correctly trying to

1391
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,099
produce good Offspring because

1392
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:58,079
unfortunately there are a lot of hybrids

1393
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:00,059
out there that are labeled as having

1394
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,800
chem 91 in them and as we've discussed

1395
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,300
many times in the past there's only a

1396
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,880
small number of people in this world who

1397
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,039
actually have the real cutting so far

1398
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,079
too often you see misspelled versions of

1399
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:12,058
chem dog with a W in the name in

1400
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,559
people's genetics and I'm sure they

1401
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,380
think that that's chem dog but

1402
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:17,940
unfortunately it's not so yeah I think

1403
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,858
that it's it's great that she's still

1404
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,599
around that she's giving people the

1405
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:23,338
pleasure of being able to smoke her and

1406
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,019
it's sort of our due diligence to

1407
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:26,539
support the proper breeders who are

1408
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:29,579
working with it correctly

1409
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:31,139
definitely an extra I think it's just a

1410
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:32,579
hard hitter you know I mean just super

1411
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:33,960
super potent I think you know the old

1412
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:35,760
school heads

1413
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,960
um they they need to get a little more

1414
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,980
kick because they're a little older so

1415
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,139
they need a little more a little more

1416
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,699
potency so you know they know what

1417
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,799
you're talking about and it definitely

1418
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:47,098
it's a well-deserved

1419
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,119
um every quality breeder that uh they

1420
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,318
have in their Arsenal like you were

1421
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,240
saying if they have it they can throw it

1422
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:52,619
and it's it's a great strain so it

1423
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:55,139
really is

1424
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:57,539
for sure so

1425
00:51:55,139 --> 00:52:00,118
um given the timing of our chat today I

1426
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:02,279
wanted to introduce a new category that

1427
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,619
wasn't in last year's Awards and it

1428
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,880
might be something we continue but I

1429
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,220
think I said before that we were doing

1430
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,318
the second last award when I when we did

1431
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:11,939
the uh Hall of Fame strain but this will

1432
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,279
actually be the second last one before

1433
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:16,139
we get on to breeder of the year and the

1434
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,260
new category we're introducing this year

1435
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:20,818
will be the breeder Hall of Fame and

1436
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,319
although High Times does their own

1437
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:25,259
version of this and you know countless

1438
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:28,440
other organizations do this year I feel

1439
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,540
is a special year because uh just this

1440
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,119
morning in fact at the time of recording

1441
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:35,279
we unfortunately heard the passing of a

1442
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,660
very revered and Senior veteran of the

1443
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,540
scene bog

1444
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:42,420
bug was not only pivotal on the forums

1445
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:44,338
but he was also you know really well

1446
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,440
known for many of his strains you know

1447
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:49,139
he got the bog bubble the sour bubble

1448
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,960
the sour dub the Boggle gum blue moon

1449
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:53,759
rocks sour grapes Lifesaver LSD sour

1450
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,818
strawberry it just it goes on and on and

1451
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,980
on and uh so many acclaimed breeders

1452
00:52:56,818 --> 00:53:02,880
have used his work within their own

1453
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:05,599

1456
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,519
of course possibly the most notable

00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:16,140
account of his work in it creating a

large percentage of the parental

one half of the suspected genetic

1462
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:29,039
combination in that one on top of that

1463
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,739
countless clones and breedings have

1464
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,779
occurred that utilize you know distant

1465
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:35,759
lineages of his work and I'm sure even

1466
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,079
more to come that were only his legacy

1467
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,359
within our scene

1468
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:41,760
so I think it's you know rightly so that

1469
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:44,338
we wish Pat all the best send her our

1470
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,500
good wishes and thoughts and hope that

1471
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:48,358
she can do the best she can in this

1472
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,219
understandably tough time for her and

1473
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,719
the family

1474
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:52,679
it also makes me think as your speaker

1475
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:54,659
there

1476
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:55,980
um I know that you know Duke tried to

1477
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:58,739
call me earlier this evening and I'll

1478
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,960
pick up the next set of calls but um I

1479
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:03,118
know that Duke had sent him uh his

1480
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,460
Screaming Eagle pollen because he wanted

1481
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,019
to wanted to help get bog back on the

1482
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,059
map so to say to bring him back out into

1483
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,800
the light and get him some sales and so

1484
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,900
I know that he had sent Jim he asked Jim

1485
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,420
if he would use and I I I middle the

1486
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,818
deal I mediated it uh but Jim said yeah

1487
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,500
no problem he would love to do that so

1488
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:20,880
um Duke had sent him some pollen and

1489
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,159
this would have been before Duke went

1490
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,539
into jail so maybe two years ago maybe

1491
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,940
they probably reconnected with the

1492
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:29,219
emerald cup we were at but um

1493
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,260
but I wonder I have to talk to Jim Jr

1494
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:34,739
see what came of that that'd be pretty

1495
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:38,220
awesome if they they did that work

1496
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:41,399
100 and as I know it so so Jim Junior's

1497
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:43,379
been breeding with Jim uh Bob Jr as as

1498
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,480
he told me so

1499
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,059
um they all they still have this year's

1500
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,059
crop of gear um he says you know they

1501
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:52,680
made a couple smaller things but as as I

1502
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,540
know it as of today you know things

1503
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:56,159
always change but he said they were

1504
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:57,480
going to keep making gear and keep using

1505
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,460
the stock that he had and you know I'm

1506
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,300
sure Pax had a huge helping at hand and

1507
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,920
all that

1508
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,140
um if he's been working with Jim Jr then

1509
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,059
that's the father and the son so

1510
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:08,578
give me some good stuff

1511
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:10,700
for sure

1512
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:13,559

1514
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:17,579

1516

1541
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,578
wasn't for his help on the forums back

1542
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,440
in the day like getting in the chat

1543
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:19,019
rooms and helping people grow and that's

1544
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,519
when you see a lot of people talk trash

1545
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:22,739
and IG and Facebook because they're so

1546
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:24,239
mean they're so such [ __ ] to where

1547
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:25,979
the forums back today they weren't mean

1548
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,199
like if you grew something somebody went

1549
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,980
like oh look at the PM glad they didn't

1550

know if you do this and this you could

1552
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,200
fix that situation and so it was a lot a

1553
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,838
lot Kinder back then

1554

1569
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,160
pillar and a legend that didn't know it

1570
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:15,000
in the community and you know they

1571
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,699

1574
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:24,599
sad he got to see the start of corporate

1575
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,280
[ __ ] I'm sure you would have hoped

1576
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:30,119
it was going in a different direction

1577
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:33,780
but I first met bog in probably 2016 and

1578
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:35,940
uh at a hemp con and at the Cow Palace

1579
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,800
in San Fran him and his wife had a booth

1580
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,420
and I went up to him and talked to him

1581
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,700
and pitched him was a big fan and so we

1582
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:45,059
started working with them from then and

1583
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:48,179
um but yeah uh so if I if I put this

1584
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:50,220
here or not but um I talked to uh Jim's

1585
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:51,659

earlier this evening right before we

1587
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:57,960
aired this and I asked um if we could do

1588
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,720
raise money for funeral expenses uh we

1589
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,940
could cover that on a GoFundMe and uh

1590
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,679
and Jim Jr said you know he was he was

1591
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,880
thrilled he was touched he was like he

1592

1613
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,660
the funeral expenses and whatnot and

1614
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:53,639
then I'm going to try to work something

1615
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:55,318
out get Mrs blog some money you know

1616
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:57,058
that's what Jim would have wanted is for

1617
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:58,558
the community to raise some money for or

1618
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:00,000
take care of you you wouldn't he would

1619
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,859
never ask of course he would never say

1620
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,838
that and I know she wouldn't either so

1621
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:06,358
we'll do it we'll do a good thing and

1622
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,679
hopefully it turns out good and the

1623
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:09,659
reasons I don't know

1624
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,179
um I didn't ask if it was hard it was

1625
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:15,000
just it wasn't anything coming up to it

1626
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:17,159
it wasn't it wasn't uh sick or anything

1627
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,079
uh it just it just happened all of a

1628
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:21,539
sudden and so that means not to believe

1629
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,579
it was this crazy year of covid that was

1630
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:24,719
was not covered because it would have

1631
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:26,519
been sick for a while and I would heard

1632
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,098
about it but this was just a surprising

1633
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:31,619
thing that happened yesterday I guess so

1634
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:34,019
you know my the best wishes to my

1635
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:36,119
condolences to the family I'm sorry

1636
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:36,960
um you know I think the community is

1637
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,099
going to come out and surprise you

1638
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,420
though I think we'll do some good things

1639
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:41,700
with that with the GoFundMe and

1640
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:44,280
definitely Hall of Fame I mean it's a

1641
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:47,039
no-brainer some lovely words there and

1642
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,798
everyone please be sure to go jump in on

1643
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,239
the GoFundMe and help support Pat as she

1644
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,460
rightly deserves

1645
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:55,139
I think something else too is you know I

1646
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,119
know Jill's going to make a strain that

1647
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:59,578
she had done with subcool but I think if

1648
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,539
breeders all came out with a strain or

1649
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:02,400
something maybe I could work something

1650
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:04,558
out with some of the guys and say hey do

1651
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,639
a strain and maybe give a kickback but

1652
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,260
um I think if all the Breeders did

1653
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:09,000
something and like bit homage or you

1654
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,980
know used his he used his gear in a

1655
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,420
cross that would be pretty pretty

1656
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,940
amazing pretty remarkable this day and

1657
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:19,019
age you know yeah

1658
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:22,139
so that brings us to the final award for

1659
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:24,358

yeah good question so we had a lot of

1668
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:54,259
people in contention for this one so

1669
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:58,078
some honorable mentions for this year

1670
01:00:54,260 --> 01:01:00,000
uh our award winner of last year CSI

1671
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,119
Humboldt got a number of honorable

1672
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,838
mentions from the community we also had

1673
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:09,059
some very very very strong support for

1674
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:10,920
the man Mean Gene with all the memes up

1675
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:13,619
his sleeve who did very well this year

1676

and amazing breeder and amazing guy like

1677
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:18,480
he's hosted a lot of the auctions

1678
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,639
um for Nick or for Duke or excellent

1679

excellent good guy very good guy um You

1680
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,980
probably if you don't know him genius he

1681
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:28,318
was uh of the breeding team Aficionado

1682
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:30,059
back in the day and now he is uh free

1683
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,279
warrant selections

1684
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:35,160
yeah I mean me and Jane's got some

1685
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,500
really nice stuff in the works uh his

1686
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:40,199
Cherry West back cross as well as he's

1687
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:43,139
done a collab with biovortex being the

1688
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:46,439
Cherry Lime dog all look really awesome

1689
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:48,838
in my opinion we also had some strong

1690
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,639
support for archive as usual not

1691
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:52,380
surprising Fletcher putting out some

1692
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,420
really nice work so a lot of people in

1693
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:58,019
the community trying to give him some

1694
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,940
big UPS we also got a nice shout out for

1695
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:02,338
trichome jungle seeds for his most

1696
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,599
recent lilt line which has done well and

1697
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:06,000
there were some people last year who

1698
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,859
were getting excited for that and he was

1699
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,659
in contention for one of the anticipated

1700
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:11,880
drop Awards so it's good to see that

1701
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:13,440
that's panned out and people are kind of

1702
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,858
giving him a thumbs up for possible

1703
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,079
breeder of the year but to me I think

1704
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:20,880
that there was only ever really two

1705
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,339
people in my mind who I think we're

1706
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,900
gonna get this award and admittedly it

1707
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:27,058
has been obviously a bit of a different

1708
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,980
year to the past and I think that plays

1709
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:30,540
into who's going to be able to win this

1710
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,338
because it becomes a bit more about

1711
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:34,079
marketing seeing as everyone's stuck at

1712
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:37,558
home so we're all filtered through the

1713
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:41,280
lens of Instagram but for me I think

1714
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:42,839
that the winner could be none other than

1715
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,819
someone who's already been mentioned a

1716
01:02:42,838 --> 01:02:46,980
plethora of times he's one of the

1717
01:02:44,818 --> 01:02:50,358
hottest breeders in the scene none other

1718
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:53,338
than JB's EFC junkie genetics

1719
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:55,078
man the guy the guy's solid

1720
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:56,940
um it was my pleasure to work with him

1721
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:00,119
when he was still slinging slinging gear

1722
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:04,318
now he says he sells he sells licenses

1723
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:06,000
he doesn't sell seats anymore so he just

1724
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:08,880
license all his product out

1725
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,980
and that's and that's part of the uh the

1726
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,980
Mystique to it I think is that this guy

1727
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:15,838
hasn't been actively selling seeds and

1728
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,699
yet he's one breeder of the year because

1729
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,078
he's still doing work it's more kind of

1730
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:20,578
behind the scenes and I think an

1731
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:23,700
interesting little side note is if you

1732
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:27,180

1733

1745
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:58,260
opposite he said you know when I picked

rag nice ride and took a nice place and

1748
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,660
he thought Brandon was gonna come in

1749
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:05,818
crazy but he can have super respectful

1750
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:08,098
and uh they worked out an excellent deal

1751
01:04:05,818 --> 01:04:10,019
and he was completely happy with it and

1752
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:12,539

01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:49,380
me but I saw burner um breeding the

1772
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:51,598
other day he had a paint brush out he

1773
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:54,059
was pollinating things

1774
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:57,240
maybe don't prove that he was breeding I

1775
01:04:54,059 --> 01:05:00,180
don't know but good photo a good photo

1776
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:02,519
up but I mean yeah look it speaks to

1777
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:04,618
JB's his dedication and effort because

1778
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:07,500
you know he's done well with the cookie

1779
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:09,240
crew his cross ice cream cake got clone

1780
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,818
of the Year from us as earlier mentioned

1781
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:14,939
and more importantly anyone who's had

1782
01:05:11,818 --> 01:05:19,500
their eyes on the uh the gelato Cross

1783
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:21,659
shirt bx1 AKA jealousy would have seen

1784
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:24,780
that almost every plant coming out of

1785
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:27,659
those packs is fire and more more kind

1786
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,400
of what I follow is how the remaining

1787
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:31,679
few packs that are out in circulation

1788
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,838
and there are a few admittedly I see

1789
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:35,759
people posting them they're just getting

1790
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:36,838
more expensive by the day I tell you

1791
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,280
what you want to talk about a pack

1792
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:39,960
that's going to go for a lot of money if

1793
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,079
you got one of those that's a nice

1794
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:45,480
little piggy bank you're sitting on

1795
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:47,480
I happen to have five

1796
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,619
um I have five of all the music easy

1797
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,119
releases yeah it's funny I didn't

1798
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:52,740
realize it was called jealousy but he's

1799
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,539
done that a couple times so name things

1800
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:56,338
just to piss people off or do something

1801
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:57,719
um and bz's not not doing the game

1802
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:59,639
either I first thought I thought it was

1803
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:01,439
a type guy because he was so

1804
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:03,058
um he had those strange but um once I

1805
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,099
talked to him got done he's been doing

1806
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:06,720
[ __ ] since like 98 and he was buying

1807
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:09,059
packs from guys in town they were taxing

1808
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,159
his ass off so he flew to Amsterdam got

1809
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:13,140
his own gear started breeding with it in

1810
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:14,759
the early you know 2000s and then those

1811
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:16,858
guys all of a sudden he was selling

1812
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,900
packs two and taxing them and so he's

1813
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:20,940
he's a gangster he loves the gassy [ __ ]

1814
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,260
so when he gets uh that's you know he

1815
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,000
really likes

1816
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,460
um but yeah he's a great dude and we're

1817
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,659
doing it for a long time uh he's a thing

1818
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,798
I said last year on the show but he's

1819
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:30,118
one of those guys I think if he was

1820
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:33,119
going to stab me it'd be him you know

1821
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:35,760
he's a [ __ ] gangster

1822
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:38,099
three years you know that's cool to hear

1823
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,720
and you know what you know as you just

1824
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:42,180
referenced anyone who's been following

1825
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:44,098
his work knows that this isn't like an

1826
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:45,779
overnight success for him by any means

1827
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:48,539
he's been put in the hard yards and the

1828
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:50,640
thing I remember him for is that I think

1829
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:54,660
he's probably the first person I ever

1830
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:57,179
saw doing like a bx2 bx3 on the TK

1831
01:06:54,659 --> 01:07:00,118
because he wanted like a TK male like he

1832
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:01,980
recognized how good the TK was in my

1833
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:04,260
opinion before anyone else except for

1834
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,358
maybe swamp boys obviously but I feel

1835
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,220
like he was he was on the ball a while

1836
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:09,779
ago and you know because TK is all the

1837
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:11,279
rage at the moment and I think for good

1838
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,798
reason it's one of the best strains out

1839
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,160
there but I feel like he he recognized

1840
01:07:13,798 --> 01:07:19,259
that before a lot of people did

1841
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:21,659
um definitely and and yeah definitely on

1842
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,500
the bx3 twos and threes and this is that

1843
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:25,078
kind of guy who's gonna work something

1844
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,400
until he finds it um and now where he's

1845
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:28,260
got a wreck facility he's even more

1846
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,720
dangerous because it's like exotic and

1847
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:32,579
an archive once now they have a wreck

1848
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,899
facility they can pop you know they can

1849
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:35,039
do finger lines of a thousand two

1850
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,480
thousand

1851
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,799
um and look for the one they want let's

1852
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,679
take the other ones and send them out to

1853
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:42,000
the market so uh that helps a lot I'm

1854
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:45,118
sure

1855
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,460
yeah definitely so big congrats to JB's

1856
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,440
you've seed junkie genetics if anyone's

1857
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:51,119
looking to try some of the flour as you

1858
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,920
can no longer get seeds unfortunately

1859
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,599
unless you've got a pretty penny go

1860
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,400
check out cookie genetics as they're

1861
01:07:54,599 --> 01:08:00,660
doing a range of collabs with him

1862
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,980
however speaking on the topic of TK I

1863
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:04,078
wanted to give an honorable mention

1864
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,719
because it was admittedly a close second

1865
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,760
place but the person in my opinion who

1866
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:10,798
got runner-up breeder of the year goes

1867
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,680
to none other than the already mentioned

1868
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:15,719
jungle boys with the Advent of their

1869
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:18,179
first sea drops occurring earlier in the

1870
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:21,119
year we saw a lot of their packets just

1871
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:24,000
selling out almost instantly they sold

1872
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:26,519
them primarily from their stores and

1873
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,380
what I found most interesting was as far

1874
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,900
as I know I could be wrong but they are

1875
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:33,239
the first people I know who sold seeds

1876
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:35,278
through their store and had other seed

1877
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:37,439
banks lining up at the store to buy

1878
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,980
those seeds to then on sell them with a

1879
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:42,960
markup which you know admittedly I think

1880
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:44,759
that's kind of cool because it reflects

1881
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,980
the popularity and it helps people who

1882
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:48,539
don't live in California get access to

1883
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:51,238
these seeds which otherwise you had to

1884
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:53,579
be there in person to buy but it goes to

1885
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:55,858
show the hype that was surrounding that

1886
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:58,738
drop that they had other seed banks in

1887
01:08:55,859 --> 01:09:01,798
line waiting to buy 10 20 packs to then

1888
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:03,358
sell them on have you heard much about

1889
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:04,738
the jungle boys Drop you referenced

1890
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,859
earlier there might be a little

1891
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:10,318
something in the works no not at all I

1892
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:11,460
wish uh they don't call me back now I

1893
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,960
know I know why I didn't know about the

1894
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,520
little the song about their stories and

1895
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,698
having other Banks pick them up and

1896
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,819
resell them that's that's uh Hollow

1897
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:23,698
Ridiculousness but uh but it does it

1898
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:25,440
does speak to their popularity and their

1899
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:26,939
their skill because as I mentioned

1900
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:29,460
earlier a friend of mine did a funeral

1901
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:30,719
home with a bunch of a bunch of packs he

1902
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,298
said there was multiple Keepers in The

1903
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:36,899
Siege in the uh jungle boys stuff and so

1904
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:38,698
they're definitely uh have a potential

1905
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:40,198
to do some serious some serious damage

1906
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:41,879
to the industry so they seriously make

1907
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:44,399
their mark But for breed of the year

1908
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,380
definitely think that you're right on on

1909
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,420
point with with bz because he's just

1910
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:50,279
been doing it longer he's been you know

1911
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:53,579
they I'm sure jungle boys used to grow

1912
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:55,320
out some of these gear and so you know

1913
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:56,880
um they kind of busy's got a longer

1914
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:59,639
history in it and

1915
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,560
um just kind of probably a greater uh a

1916
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,739
greater genetic catalog than the library

1917
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:06,179
to choose from but uh but yeah no sugar

1918
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:07,439
boys don't call me back now I know why

1919
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:08,699
they don't need a seed bank they have

1920
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,599
guys who are going to wait in line and

1921
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:11,599
resell shift for them

1922
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:16,679
yeah look I mean they they got to be one

1923
01:10:14,698 --> 01:10:20,279
of the Masters of the marketing right

1924
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:21,840
like um Ivan has done a very good job at

1925
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:23,698
marketing jungle boys I think anyone who

1926
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,219
denies that is just a little bit jealous

1927
01:10:23,698 --> 01:10:28,019
yeah no I haven't he crashed it with uh

1928
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:29,460
obviously George cookies that was the

1929
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,380
first that's selling on my map was they

1930
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,060
were crushing it with that stuff and you

1931
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:34,260
know I was of course was little no

1932
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:36,000
they're not giving me enough credit you

1933
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:38,699
know but uh he always he always does

1934
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,979
that but uh but yeah they uh they our

1935
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:44,000
marketing uh Geniuses I don't know why

1936
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:46,439
they don't return my emails it

1937
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,939
don't worry I'm just as upset as you I'd

1938
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:49,198
love to get my hands on a pack and I

1939
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:51,479
don't know how it'll otherwise happen

1940
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:54,419
but I mean to give credit where credit's

1941
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:57,000
due they've done some really nice work

1942
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,859
with the the TK bx1 mail they've made

1943
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,779
they've also released some nice crosses

1944
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:04,198
with the jungle cake mail they've used

1945
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:06,960
they've got a few other crosses they use

1946
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:09,539
using like an MBK Sunset sherbet sort of

1947
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,460
male and they've also got a skittles

1948
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:13,439
cake mail they're using among others

1949
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:15,239
which have done really well I think the

1950
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:18,000
thing which impresses me the most about

1951
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:20,039
their work though is that they've done

1952
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,500
what I had always advocated as the best

1953
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:24,600
way to be a breeder which is they just

1954
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,158
spent years doing these Fino hunts

1955
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,320
finding these killer cuts that people

1956
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,698
were dying for and then once they

1957
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,738
amassed enough of them they were like

1958
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:34,259
cool I've now got my palette to do my

1959
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:36,000
painting and to do my breeding and so

1960
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:39,179
pretty much all of their crosses for the

1961
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,100
most part use unique cuts and or strains

1962
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:43,920
that they've spent the time Fino hunting

1963
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:46,800
there's a lot of document entered demand

1964
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,140
and quality surrounding those strains so

1965
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,900
yeah as much as there might be some

1966
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:53,340
people who don't like the brand itself I

1967
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:55,259
feel like there's very little if

1968
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:57,360
anything you can criticize about the way

1969
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,699
they've gone about releasing these seeds

1970
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,198
in the you know they they didn't just go

1971
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:02,939
buy a bunch of clones and hit it with

1972
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,279
the first male they found they did spend

1973
01:12:02,939 --> 01:12:07,198
some quality time Fino hunting many of

1974
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,880
the females used in the crosses as well

1975
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:11,099
as generating the mail

1976
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,199
yeah that's that's years of time that

1977
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,460
they do have in it and they crush it

1978
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:16,139
with their social media game they crush

1979
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,640
it with photos like we spoke about

1980
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:19,679
photos earlier and they have awesome

1981
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:21,600
photos because you know in point because

1982
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,039
their shit's awesome you know that

1983
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,380
couldn't have great photos I'm like here

1984
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,840
it wasn't awesome but you know uh but

1985
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,239
they everything looks good super Frosty

1986
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,219
um but yeah like I said I've heard good

1987
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:33,899
stuff and I'm trying to get them I will

1988
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:35,219
try I know I know I'll hype there but uh

1989
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:36,420
I don't know if they're selling me

1990
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:37,380
probably tell me to pick a number get

1991
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:40,920
line

1992
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:42,960
that's it right so with that being said

1993
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,640
I think we're just about at the end of

1994
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,158
the awards for this year's were there

1995
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,840
any comments shout outs or Hot Tips you

1996
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:52,139
wanted to give the listeners personally

1997
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,640
I haven't dealt with bz since 2019 and I

1998
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,920
haven't dealt with jungle boys and I

1999
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,780
haven't gotten there in their line yet

2000
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,520
um what I do know though is from my bank

2001
01:12:57,779 --> 01:13:01,679
personally I'd like to throw out there

2002
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,940
just as a as a honorable mention but

2003
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,039
exotic genetics I know we probably

2004
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:07,859
talked about them last year but he had

2005
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:11,579
six big drops with us this year of my 60

2006
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:13,738
breeders he was he outsold everybody

2007
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:15,539
um the closest guy wasn't even half the

2008
01:13:13,738 --> 01:13:17,279
packs that Mike sold

2009
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:19,140
um the six drops You Came Out Swinging

2010
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,880
with the Grease Monkey fem line of Ring

2011
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:23,159
of the year which was huge

2012
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,079
um they had uh two uh the wrench drop

2013
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:26,399
came which you got like I said was

2014
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:28,079
saying there you know he got the jump on

2015
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:29,579
the runs guys and so he was able to

2016
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:32,460
release the whole stream with those guys

2017
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:34,140
our whole uh whole line of those

2018
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:36,300
um then he had the red pop which is his

2019
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,860
strawberries and cream Fino those are

2020
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,300
another another complete draw up and

2021
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:41,519
then he came back and redid the wrench

2022
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,020
the rents drop again which all I mean

2023
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,880
all these sold out within less than a

2024
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,920
week like I I even hit him up for packs

2025
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,679
after the fact I was like Hey Okay more

2026
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,940
no the big ones were sold out

2027
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,219
um and then of course he closed it off

2028
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:55,678
with uh with the rainbow chip line so uh

2029
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:57,060
you know he's got he's it's kind of a

2030
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,859
winning combination I think we're

2031
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:01,380
starting to see he takes great photos

2032
01:13:58,859 --> 01:14:03,719
he's got a wreck license we can run he

2033
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:05,940
can run Fino's he can run the numbers

2034
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,800
um and that gives him a you know it's

2035
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:09,419
not a it's not cheating but it gives him

2036
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,560
a greater ability to find the thing you

2037
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,000
know the more numbers you run the more

2038
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,860
things you can find

2039
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,420
um you know he's been I've been lucky to

2040
01:14:13,859 --> 01:14:16,859
deal with him for for eight years I

2041
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:18,420

2042
01:14:16,859 --> 01:14:20,279
