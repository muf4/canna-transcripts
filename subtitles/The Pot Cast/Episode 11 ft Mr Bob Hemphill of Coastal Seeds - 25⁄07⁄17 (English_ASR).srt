1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,449
I just wanted to make a quick

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,990
announcement guys first of all some good

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:05,250

we're gonna have some changes coming to

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,220
the show and it's going to basically

6
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,530
result in more content so I hope

7
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,870
everyone's excited for more episodes the

8
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:14,579
bad news however is that SoundCloud is

9
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,259
likely closing down in four weeks or so

10
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,118
most people do listen to our show

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,679
through SoundCloud however I've begun

12
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,140

13
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,028

33
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,329
I like to start off every interview with

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,640
is what was your first experience with

35
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:31,950
cannabis it was summer between ninth and

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,379
10th grade and a friend of mine from

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,540
neighborhood uh Ron scored some Mexican

38
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:43,500
we eat and you had this little homemade

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:48,659
pipe and we smoked one day after school

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:51,328
at a party and then we smoked like you

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,909
know two or three days later and after

42
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,968
that second time we smoked I know you

43
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,219
know I had a big love for cannabis cuz

44
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,298
the way it just relaxed me um where I

45
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:02,908
grew up in Northern Virginia was

46
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,810
high-stress area you know very

47
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,819
competitive and um you know just to be

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,280
able to relax and connect back to nature

49
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,799
type of vibe is you know how I always

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,120
wanted to live and

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,800
it was just just it was awesome and so

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,129
what with Australians kind of floating

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,550
around back then well I could only get

54
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:29,219
Mexican and Jamaican and now

55
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,850
occasionally Asian or African brick

56
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:36,389
weeds alone and you know they were

57
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,430
smashed and mostly sativa and that's

58
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,319
where we got our first you know seeds to

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,780
grow we just you know pulled them out of

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,009
some of the first sex we ever smoked and

61
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,409
um we just planted the seeds and I had

62
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,929
you know two really hard Hard Knocks

63
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:55,079
years of you know like the first year

64
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,000
just left the plants in too much shakes

65
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,520
I know I had to hide them and I put them

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,219
in so much shade they ended up just

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,219
falling over and dying the second year I

68
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:08,490
grill um had a plant growing and I had a

69
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,469
flowering and I literally brought it

70
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,960
inside because of a frost warning and

71
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,639
stuck it under 24 hours old I cuz I

72
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,560
didn't know as a twelve and twelve life

73
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:21,449
cycle that made it flower at the time

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,870
and you know really hard knocks yeah and

75
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,429
so during that time were there any

76
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,319
things around like you know like the

77
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,760
counter Bible or was just predating that

78
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,139
and I mean I guess it goes without

79
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,819
saying you didn't have kind of any

80
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,899
family members you could refer to

81
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,549
because that's something I found is a

82
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,230
bit of a commonality between a lot of

83
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,600
people we talk to a lot of people seem

84
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,310
to have at least one family member who's

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,370
kind of pushing them along but you sound

86
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,250
like he didn't know I had a lot of older

87
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,900
brothers and sisters but none of them

88
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,620
grew or really hooked me up with

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,420
cannabis um it was actually the other

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,819
way around even from a young age I was

91
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,119
always giving my older brothers and

92
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,759
sisters cannabis because after that

93
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,069
second time of smoking it I knew I

94
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,959
wanted it around me all the time and you

95
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,639
know us you know I was hustling it and

96
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,430
trying to grow it from the start you

97
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,738
know just so I could get a free sack and

98
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,540
like I said the first two years I tried

99
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,120
to grow it was hard knocks but that

100
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:21,099
third year I left it out and it was

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Mexican sativa and

102
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,360
and it was amazing you know it was total

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,759
citrus amazing high and then um

104
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,819
at that time you know Grateful Dead

105
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,129
would come around um that was when I was

106
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:37,540
a senior in high school and that's when

107
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:39,009
I started going to the Grateful Dead

108
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,450
shows and actually people were burning

109
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:45,339
kind but out from California and that's

110
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,110
less the first kind but I got was you

111
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:48,810
know going to a Grateful Dead show and

112
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:55,650
then the first time actually got my

113
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:59,680
hands on some kind blood seeds was 1995

114
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:04,449
right after I harvested data first

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,150
Mexican weed that fall at my fish over

116
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:09,430
New Year show I scored some kind but

117
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:13,149
from Humboldt and I got dank seeds and

118
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,290
that you know kind of odd seeds and I

119
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:19,859
grow them and [ __ ] was amazing you know

120
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,729
and I you know I bred those

121
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,360
unfortunately crossbred them to a

122
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:26,769
Southern Virginia string instead of

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,360
breeding them brother to sister and

124
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:32,709
keeping that line pure because I was

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:36,729
really quality weed and so was that

126
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:38,519
outdoors and if if it was outdoors did

127
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:41,769
that just signal in your mind that

128
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,449
genetics was the key to you or what what

129
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:45,459
did what did it signal to you at that

130
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,319
point like you know you had kind of this

131
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,149
awakening with cannabis of what was

132
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,740
possible what was the first thing you

133
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,478
were thinking like [ __ ] I need to start

134
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,710
be doing this indoors with good genetics

135
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,439
or like you know like maybe something

136
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,459
different but what were you thinking

137
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,500
well you know I was always getting the

138
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:03,430
High Times magazines and hearing about

139
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,339
sensi seeds and in Nevel and all that

140
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:10,538
[ __ ] and you know the amazing strands

141
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:12,788
they had and you know uh you know I knew

142
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:14,680
could be bud was out there just you know

143
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:16,629
being in Northern Virginia as far a few

144
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,250
between especially for young kids you

145
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,189
know when you're in high school you're

146
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,319
low on the totem pole so we just pretty

147
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,769
much had to make the good but you know

148
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:29,848
and you know the first time I smoked

149
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:32,769
some good Northern Lights was

150
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:34,089
Philadelphia spectrum at a Grateful Dead

151
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:37,359
show and

152
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:40,239
it was in the fall of 94 right before

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,569
they came and played a the Capitol

154
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,009
Center and smoking that indoor good

155
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,500
Northern Lights it was actually from

156
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,779
this dude that I knew from Virginia but

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,290
seeing them at a Grateful Dead show he

158
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:57,179
kind of opened up more and it was just

159
00:06:53,290 --> 00:07:00,400
amazing and you know at that same time

160
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,160
you know everyone was on a quest to get

161
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,429
the best genetics and I had a friend of

162
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,200
mine who went to Amsterdam and early 95

163
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,269
and he bought packs of everything he'd

164
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,439
get his hands on like the most you know

165
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:13,599
everything he could have floored he

166
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,769
actually got money from another friend

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,200
of ours too and those guys you know that

168
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:23,199
about the the four way pack and you know

169
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:27,039
when we popped it that far away it was

170
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,500
you know took stuff over and I mean

171
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,479
being with those guys they had mentors

172
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,259
unlike me they who I taught him how to

173
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:37,029
grow inside and and run [ __ ] you know

174
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,779
like not just in a closet like one a

175
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:43,509
whole basement or a whole crow and I was

176
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:45,668
lucky to get with those guys and you

177
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,969
know at the 4way pretty much changed it

178
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:52,449
was almost like we we had that and it

179
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,130
was like there wasn't much better at the

180
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:58,870
time the only things I remember better

181
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:59,829
was a no hash plant cross and that [ __ ]

182
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,660
was amazing

183
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:07,269
and then an old hash plant nlg 13 cross

184
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,930
and that that cross used to come around

185
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:13,389
to Northern Virginia when it was called

186
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,918
to kill and that was the best weed I've

187
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,900
ever smoked to this day I remember

188
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:20,199
telling the guys hey we'll trade this

189
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:21,909
for white clone for that kill clone they

190
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,819
straight laughed in my face you know

191
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,850
they just didn't think it was even a

192
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:29,139
fair trade at all where the far away was

193
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,600
a lot of people consider it the best

194
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:34,149
we'd ever smoked in our ice this kill

195
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,370
was that much better and to this day the

196
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:39,129
only thing I can you know reminds me I

197
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,209
was like you know chem dog and it was

198
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:46,269
very loud and just very crystally and

199
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:47,059
amazingly and so in God's to the full

200
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,149
way

201
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,399
do you think that that pack was a lucky

202
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,439
pack or like this was just at a time

203
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,389
where since he was so good that every

204
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,220
pack potentially had a clone that good

205
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:02,990
in it well since he was really good in

206
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,139
the early 90s because I remember anyone

207
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,940
that got a pack if they you know found

208
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,799
some good [ __ ] maybe they didn't keep

209
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,960
the clones cuz it was hard at that time

210
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,719
to keep clones but everyone that was

211
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,820
getting stuff stuff was pretty good but

212
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,399
I really think that four way was you

213
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,620
know very special because other crews in

214
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,019
Northern Virginia told me they bought

215
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,060
several packs and never found anything

216
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:29,149
to play thing near as close this thing

217
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:33,609
wasn't very skunky you know pretty stony

218
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:36,679
and I'm very just loves flavor and so

219
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,500
the 4-ways got some interesting genetics

220
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,329
in it you know specifically the Pocky

221
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,070
and the Indian you know we see Pocky a

222
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,830
little more common than Indian but you

223
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,930
know you rarely see Indian at all you

224
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,389
just mentioned its skunky you know do

225
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:52,699
those other genetics really influence it

226
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:54,620
too much like do you think that I know

227
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,480
you so you mentioned it's very skunky do

228
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,919
you'd notice any Indian influence or do

229
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,870
you think maybe that's what makes it

230
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,759
more skunky than the others so to speak

231
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,120
like some weird interplay between the

232
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,340
two you know it's a really complex

233
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,409
strain some people you know describe it

234
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,750
as like a buttery smell when you're

235
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:18,529
breaking it up and then like a starburst

236
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:20,570
smell and just kind of sweet but from

237
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:23,269
like ten feet away if you have a bag in

238
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,500
your pocket it just reeks like skunk you

239
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,470
know like if he brought it into a

240
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,230
two-story house the people in the second

241
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,899
storey house would say damn this show

242
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,190
what the [ __ ] who killed skunk type of

243
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,399
[ __ ] I remember one time I have long

244
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,320
dreadlocks and I was you know waiting in

245
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,029
line in a gas station and the guy kept

246
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,610
asking everyone in line who hid the

247
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:47,269
skunk and I literally had to bite my lip

248
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,100
just to not laugh and I finally you know

249
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,960
got to the Castro Chinese damn he's like

250
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,940
someone really hit a skunk out there and

251
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,920
I I can't believe the guy never thought

252
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,740
that this dread head has a [ __ ] sack

253
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,788
Oh Eden's sock in pocket but he really

254
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:06,139
thought someone had hit a skunk

255
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:08,149
nice nice and so just in terms of the

256
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,399
whole timeline of things did the

257
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,558
roadkill skunk exist at this time or was

258
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,408
this before or after it had come onto

259
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:17,928
the scene well I remember seeing skunk

260
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:23,208
number one a few times and you know 94

261
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:27,588
95 96 it was always a more citrus town

262
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:30,408
never us allowed skunk you know and you

263
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:32,299
know only skunk number one clones I know

264
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:35,838
of people that save just you know the

265
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:37,548
Las Vegas lemon skunk and then yeah UK

266
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,739
cheese and the other of them smell like

267
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:41,718
skunk either I'm not saying there wasn't

268
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:43,509
skunk peanuts and skunk number one I'm

269
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:46,219
just saying I personally never saw them

270
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:49,489
yeah so you have the opinion that the

271
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:51,379
red kills gun was possibly an Afghani

272
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:55,249
which is what we've heard frequently on

273
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:57,979
the show you know every time I smell

274
00:11:55,249 --> 00:12:02,479
something skunky it was yeah

275
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:04,729
a strong indica cross for sure and so

276
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:06,619
one of the other cuts you hang on to and

277
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:10,249
I see regular on your feet is the black

278
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:11,839
Domino is this one that is kind of

279
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:13,699
equally as good as the four-way or do

280
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,409
you think maybe it's almost as good but

281
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:17,658
not quite as good but you know like if

282
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:19,879
anything's within the ballpark of the

283
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:23,379
four-way then you know it's like it's

284
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,938
probably gonna be elite nonetheless um

285
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:28,129
you know to be honest with you about the

286
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:31,038
four-way the only reason I'm keeping it

287
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:34,158
alive is because of a special connection

288
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:35,778
with it and what I hope it can produce

289
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:37,428
and its offspring and that's what I'm

290
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:40,639
seeing and over the years it's always

291
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:42,889
been a good producer for me but um the

292
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,739
black domina cuts I have our old Scentsy

293
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:48,408
stock and they're much stronger than the

294
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:52,249
for white potency wise and you know I I

295
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:53,838
prefer them and you know I'm always

296
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:58,209
looking for any block down I'm gonna cut

297
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:02,179
I can get I have one that's just 1995

298
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:04,578
sensi seeds selection I got from ethnic

299
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:08,708
the nature farmer and I got another one

300
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:11,269
up in southern Humboldt at a harvest

301
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:13,319
healing harvest farmers market held by

302
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,810
that guys a whole demo cup and

303
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,269
it was actually their vending booth and

304
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:20,278
I walked by with a friend and we'd seen

305
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:22,980
that they had black domina for sale

306
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,870
and you know I'm like oh I want to pluck

307
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,730
domina he's like well you know get to

308
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,560
the end of the line and I turn around

309
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,070
and the lines like you know fifty feet

310
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,768
long

311
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,209
you know go way down to the line and you

312
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,539
know it's fun you know we're talking

313
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:38,578
about weed the whole time um and you'll

314
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,948
get to the end of the line and he tells

315
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:43,049
me they're sold out and you know I'm

316
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:45,000
like a little you know heartbroken and

317
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:48,269
my friend he's a you know a real smooth

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,578
talker he's like you know can you can

319
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:52,560
you go look and the guy goes and looks

320
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,239
and he's like oh my god there's one last

321
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,088
one and you know we just start giving

322
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,009
each other high-fives and [ __ ]

323
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:00,750
because I was told the only thing I was

324
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:03,839
told about it before I got in line is it

325
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,120
sold ciências seed stock and you know if

326
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,430
it's kept around in Humboldt County and

327
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,480
it sold since he seed stock it's you

328
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:15,739
know it's a winner and um yeah both of

329
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,300
them have a very narcotic stone which

330
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,159
I'd prefer and above because I like

331
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:24,838
something though relax man calm me down

332
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:28,799
and it's a mix of Pacific Northwest hash

333
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,199
plant Northern Light Ortega and Afghani

334
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:35,429
number one which is originally known as

335
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:39,750
m10 the land race Afghani ax um from the

336
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:41,879
super sativa seed Club so what miles do

337
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,708
you think partner well with it like you

338
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,328
mentioned it's really not Kartik so do

339
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:48,299
you think that for example crossing it

340
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:49,828
to a sativa would kind of take away from

341
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,189
that you want to keep it kind of in that

342
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:55,289
indica dominant realm or not necessarily

343
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,480
well III don't have any but I've always

344
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:00,889
heard that since he seeds produced some

345
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,610
fire a really good blackjack like

346
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:08,310
dominant Jack here crosses and then I

347
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,649
personally you know got my hands on mom

348
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:12,328
Yemen I really was excited to cross him

349
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:15,000
to the Northern Lights number one male

350
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:19,198
just to keep that old-school North

351
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,120
narcotic indica Janecka live in the gene

352
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,919
pool cuz it's you know that's my most

353
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,068
sought-after stuff and it seems like no

354
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,120
one's really offering that and luckily

355
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:31,919
keg you wanna

356
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,990
and the open pollination in a one pure

357
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,939
line that I had never left the west

358
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,019
coast that it he had gotten from his

359
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:43,320
friend classic seeds and I was able to

360
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,689
select a male out of that first I popped

361
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,100
like 40 and then I realized how good

362
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:53,010
they were and I thought 95 and selected

363
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,399
the best man out of all those I really

364
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:59,159
went for the side of the gene pool and

365
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,829
then no one that was like a spray paint

366
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,829
you know kind of a chemical and that was

367
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,300
only a I only solved in about 20 percent

368
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:11,460
of the gene pool the other 80 percent

369
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:14,729
was your more classic fruity indica you

370
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,889
know very kind of smell and you know I

371
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,810
had some good friends up and we smoked

372
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,528
on my chem dogs and on my oh jeez and

373
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:24,838
naturally said they preferred the

374
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:28,169
turpentine spray paint and Alfie nosed

375
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,480
over everything and I you know that's

376
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:33,509
the type of nail I was going after you

377
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:38,070
know tried to match the phenotype okay

378
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:40,559
and so do you notice any of those NL

379
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,060
characteristics in the chem dog when

380
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,969
youse were smoking that or is it more of

381
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:47,879
it was just like a preference over well

382
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,830
you know as far as chem dog I always

383
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:53,399
thought chem dog went back to Northern

384
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:55,379
Lights um but you know recently now that

385
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,259
I'm really got my hands on some really

386
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,669
good classic cache plant cuts I think

387
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:04,439
it's maybe a combination of the two um

388
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:08,159
but that's just my guess you know just

389
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,660
from how I saw we progress you know all

390
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,839
the best [ __ ] was Northern Lights

391
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,730
crosses and then you know come dog

392
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,609
anoche came on the scene and no one know

393
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,199
what they were so you know I um there's

394
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,469
some ask Andy to the next that were

395
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,360
similar to that or the same exact

396
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,900
genetics okay

397
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,789
and so just out of curiosity when you

398
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,550
mentioned that keg you had done the open

399
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:35,009
pollination with the no.1 had he made

400
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,500
any comment about how the plants that

401
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,720
you grew out like you know was there any

402
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,410
little slight differences between that

403
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,660
generation

404
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,310
the previous or do you think that they

405
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,590
were pretty much identical you know like

406
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,210
I guess I'm wondering even throughout in

407
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,829
pollination techniques do you think you

408
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,910
do get a little bit of change over time

409
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:57,899
or not really so from what I've learned

410
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:02,070
from him if you use as many males as

411
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,290
many females don't bottleneck the

412
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:07,439
genetics that you can keep everything in

413
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:09,359
see Flom that's how he's always done and

414
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,850
stuff his whole life he never really

415
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,009
kept clones until you know about ten

416
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:18,299
years ago they always just put stuff in

417
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:20,250
the seed so they could grow it again you

418
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,889
know like you know I wish I had known

419
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,250
that in early 90s I have a bunch of

420
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:28,050
amazing lines now so in terms of the end

421
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,869
product of the Northern Lights you go

422
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:34,440
out have you seen yourself or being

423
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:37,049
given any NL stock or buds from you know

424
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,950
any modern breeders that resembled that

425
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:43,289
or was it just totally different well to

426
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,710
be honest with you I feel like most of

427
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:49,710
Northern Lights genetics disappeared I

428
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,180
was given some of sensi stock recently

429
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,600
to grow when I was growing those ones

430
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:57,330
from Katie one and I got some Bodhi

431
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:01,079
seeds I know and grew them at the same

432
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:04,199
time and I was very thankful to find

433
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:07,409
that kgs no.1 was exactly what I

434
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,029
remembered from a kid and it was so much

435
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,310
better than sensi seeds it was

436
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:14,339
ridiculous and what I grew from buddy

437
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,710
was the nl5 British Columbia sea cloth

438
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:19,230
open pollination and a few other

439
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:22,500
different crosses that my friend Kelly

440
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:27,410
death vest gave me and they were really

441
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:31,740
good but none of them had that narcotic

442
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:34,529
turpentine spray paint Venus that I was

443
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,019
really looking for that uh I was very

444
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,970
excited to find and I don't want um

445
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:42,440
because you know we were hoping to use

446
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,180
it and as exactly what I was looking for

447
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,789
so how do you think Northern Lights v

448
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,230
became this massive poster child for the

449
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:53,879
cannabis community if it sounds like

450
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:57,230
Northern Lights one was way better when

451
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:01,890
I grew the Northern Lights one versus

452
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:07,200
that British Columbia sea club from

453
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:09,930
Bodhi day his nl5 had way better bag

454
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,450
appeal we're talking way better it had a

455
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:15,720
more round nug it actually had a more

456
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,720
crystals on the outside of the note but

457
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,450
the effect of the nl1 is exactly what I

458
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,360
was looking for so with that being said

459
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,160
about the betta bag appeal on the nl5 do

460
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,949
you think that that kind of highlights

461
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,290
the issue of you know the compromise of

462
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,700
quality traits within the plant versus

463
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:38,159
bag appeal over the years yes when I

464
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,740
moved to Northern California in 97 there

465
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,750
was so much diversity in the wheat grown

466
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,130
in Humboldt Mendo and Trinity counties

467
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:49,380
it was amazing and then right about 2000

468
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,090
everyone that had to have purple or it

469
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,660
became a problem to sell your wheat and

470
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:58,409
then a few years after that it was you

471
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,720
had to have OG and if you didn't have OG

472
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,380
the buyers didn't even want to look at

473
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,920
it and at that point you know a lot of

474
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,630
people just dropped their old lines and

475
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:13,440
everyone was growing oh gee or purple

476
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:16,500
and there are amazing types of weed but

477
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,730
a lot of genetics were lost and it's a

478
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,829
shame and so do you think that people

479
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,900
drop stuff out of their head stash

480
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:27,149
rotation so to speak I guess because

481
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,190
what I'm trying to say is I thought that

482
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,630
there was always strains where people

483
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,299
always viewed them as like this isn't

484
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,010
something I can sell like grow for sale

485
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,659
to the masses because like maybe it's

486
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,640
hard to grow or it doesn't yield well or

487
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,529
bla bla bla do you think strains that

488
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,720
even fit into that category were drops

489
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,059
because I guess my initial instinct is

490
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,009
thinking like surely some people kept

491
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,779
like the really good ones even if they

492
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:51,839
just figured like I just grow it for

493
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:54,960
personal to be honest with you most

494
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,819
people don't keep that good of a mother

495
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,309
room or don't keep strains for long

496
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,829
that's the reason I you know I've got

497
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,569
the nickname the librarian mom it's

498
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:05,549
mostly because I just keep the strains

499
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:07,230
for all my homies and I've been doing

500
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,619
this forever because just like when I

501
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,210
was like

502
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:12,239
I just wanted to have a good weed around

503
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,670
me once I have it around me I just want

504
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,190
to keep it there and I just take care of

505
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,920
these plants and it's very dedicated to

506
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,808
it and you know there are other people

507
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,880
that's how I find these jewels and

508
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:26,970
trading you know when I got on Instagram

509
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,070
it really helped me gain access to a lot

510
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,170
of genetics you know meeting other

511
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:34,529
people that kept strains like that you

512
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:36,900
know but I kept a lot of strengths for

513
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:38,490
my friends and a lot of times even when

514
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,620
they were just running one strand they'd

515
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,259
come back and get the copy from me after

516
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:47,669
a year to just cuz I kept a healthier

517
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:50,400
copy mainly because I never compromised

518
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,990
them never you know there was times

519
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,340
where me and Hannibal literally had a

520
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:58,950
bedroom in her master bedroom not even

521
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:01,169
in the closet just in the corner just

522
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:05,039
because that's you know the kind of

523
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:07,920
commitment I have and I think she has it

524
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,329
just as hard as me and she's actually

525
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,460
encouraged me to keep some of the

526
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:14,129
strains around forever that we

527
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,289
necessarily don't like to smoke on like

528
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,770
the train wreck is a perfect example of

529
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:21,259
that

530
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:24,599
when I first you know got the strain in

531
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:26,039
99 you know it was amazing but that

532
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,990
terpene will get to you after a while

533
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:32,039
I'm kind of cut and chuck about it you

534
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:33,960
being train rat poison and so on the

535
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,139
idea of you know the whole librarian

536
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,819
thing what are some of the more

537
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,220
lesser-known cuts you keep in your stash

538
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:44,000
that you think would be well received by

539
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:48,509
the public if they were more well known

540
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,250
black domina you know the public is you

541
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:53,009
know different than me I'm a real

542
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,769
serious indica lover you know and

543
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:58,500
anything that the public really likes I

544
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:01,139
generally try to have access to but I

545
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,700
feel like a lot of the strong calming

546
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,280
and because most people have kind of

547
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:10,500
lost stuff like the Black Diamond odd

548
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,629
and Northern Alliance number one a lot

549
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,329
of people don't have the real chem dog D

550
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,880
which is absolutely hands-down favorite

551
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:20,509
and you know there's not many people out

552
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,329
there you know producing those you know

553
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,949
it costly people's out there and with

554
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,528
Incredibles and they got the real deal

555
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:31,369
that's gonna be amazing for the weed out

556
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:33,588
in Colorado yeah so this idea of the

557
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:36,528
fake chem Dodie I've heard of this

558
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:38,868
before I do you think that there's just

559
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:43,209
like a bunch of s ones floating around

560
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:45,558
or you moreso referring to the Decius

561
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:47,419
well there's a lot of people with the

562
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:49,940
sister that the think it's the D and

563
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,859
then there's tons of fakes out in

564
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,259
California if you just go to any club

565
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:55,759
and you you got you you you can get any

566
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,519
elite they're all on the menus that

567
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,919
these clubs out here but ninety nine out

568
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:04,548
of a hundred times they're gonna be fake

569
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,559
as can be and you know there's a million

570
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:08,778
clubs out here selling chem dough and

571
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,168
there's a million fake breeders out

572
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:13,759
there breeding with chem dog and people

573
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:16,489
never seen it because like I said it's

574
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,219
kind of limited and there's only a few

575
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:22,548
people are really grown commercial you

576
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:25,759
know and I'm mostly grown for head you

577
00:25:22,548 --> 00:25:27,888
know I just covered on myself yeah okay

578
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,769
and so if we just jump back to that idea

579
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:32,118
of you maintaining the client's and your

580
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,739
friends would come back and grab them

581
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:35,509
from you because you know they couldn't

582
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:37,940
keep it as good as you that got me

583
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:40,669
thinking how what's the shortest amount

584
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,338
of time you've ever seen for a clone to

585
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:45,679
go bad like have you seen a clone turned

586
00:25:43,338 --> 00:25:47,208
crap in say like a year because or does

587
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,239
it take like longer than that even if

588
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:52,190
it's really poorly maintained well you

589
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:54,499
know our selected females out of you

590
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,719
know seed hunting and you know hunting

591
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:58,759
and some of those are amazing from seed

592
00:25:56,719 --> 00:26:02,629
or the first clone and they deteriorate

593
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:05,719
fast you know and I couldn't tell you

594
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:08,689
why and then some of these are old you

595
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:11,568
know really good clones I have you know

596
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,179
they're very old and they have been you

597
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:16,158
know dgeren generated as much as other

598
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:18,798
clones that are younger because like I'd

599
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,009
say for example far away from ninety

600
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:26,048
five has degenerated more than the chem

601
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:29,450
duck ninety-one and I have the Romulan

602
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:32,148
1969 Ron one show cut and you know that

603
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,580
thing hasn't degenerated too much at all

604
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:35,559
it's a you know it'll

605
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:38,589
it's a picky little girl's gonna pre

606
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:42,339
flower but considering she's going on 50

607
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:45,459
years here in a year to UM just [ __ ]

608
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:47,709
amazing you know and then you know the

609
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,170
train wreck is deteriorating on me

610
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,799
pretty hard in these last few years no

611
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:55,690
matter how healthy I keep it and I think

612
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:58,210
it's just genetic just like people you

613
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,130
know that's you know people age faster

614
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,950
than other people and just a roll of the

615
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:06,250
dice okay

616
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,860
and so just while we're on the topic do

617
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,650
you think that Romulan Joe's cutting of

618
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:12,879
Romulan is the oldest cut in existence

619
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,210
or do you think maybe someone's hanging

620
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,060
onto something colder the oldest thing I

621
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:24,250
know of I'm not saying it is the oldest

622
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:28,359
by any means but I've heard rumors that

623
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:32,619
I might be even older than 69 cuz pagan

624
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:35,589
no alarms guy was working on the farm

625
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:38,500
and Romulan Joe pretty much drop it off

626
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:42,250
with his boss kind of deal in 1969 and

627
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:45,640
he held it on to it all that time and on

628
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,170
his since passed away and so what do you

629
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,650
think is the back story behind it

630
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:52,750
because what I heard was that either Joe

631
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,280
or someone he knew was in the Korean War

632
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,230
and they brought back some land rice and

633
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:59,170
it was just like you know selectively

634
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:01,269
bred to be squat and more indica though

635
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:03,430
it was a sativa

636
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:05,589
that could be total [ __ ] but love to

637
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,870
you what you think you know it's a squat

638
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:10,149
little undercooked plant you know I you

639
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:11,979
know it'll dent your head man you know

640
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,240
it's just [ __ ] it'll [ __ ] you up

641
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,680
that's some strong [ __ ] and you know I

642
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,839
would brother scrum produce some really

643
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:24,009
excellent stuff with it you know um

644
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,689
space clean so yeah yeah the Killer

645
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:29,759
Queen yep I'm gonna grow that out soon

646
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:34,269
yeah I think the killer queen is on the

647
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:37,269
airborne g13 yeah yeah yeah true true

648
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:39,490
true sorry what I was thinking was um it

649
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:41,049
was it was Vic hi who made space Queen

650
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:45,430
yeah yeah yeah for sure

651
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:47,139
I love the The Killer Queen cutter I

652
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,900
have it's amazing and

653
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,900
I'm stoked I just declared the airborne

654
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:55,420
g13 so how would you describe that

655
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,190
that's actually probably one of the few

656
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,808
things I wasn't able to smoke out of

657
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,640
Tony's collection I just don't think he

658
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:02,170
had me around yeah how would you

659
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,980
describe it because he said to me he

660
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:07,960
reckons it's g13 NL 2 or something you

661
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,910
know that's what the old forum people

662
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,340
saying you know I'm gonna believe them

663
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:16,540
and I've not got a chance to flour it

664
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:19,000
out yet but I'm excited very excited I

665
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:22,990
will have it ready you know in a few

666
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,390
months here so ok it's just got the cut

667
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,370
all healthy and cleaned up and you know

668
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,900
it takes a few months because I don't

669
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:31,558
like the flower things right awake so

670
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,730
I'll get a bad impression generally oh

671
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,740
really it's like you want to kind of do

672
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,200
a little bit of revitalizing yourself

673
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,480
before you get in there yeah because I

674
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,640
have so many our clones and stuff I

675
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,220
don't have that many times to just run

676
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,630
them all new ones unless you know I just

677
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,819
want to have them really healthy so I

678
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:52,620
don't get a bad impression and giving

679
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:56,668
the Delta clone its fair chance you know

680
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:58,689
yeah ok and so let's get to that

681
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,130
revitalizing of clones because this is

682
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,779
something you're very known for and I

683
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,640
think the other kind of guy in the scene

684
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:07,178
is well known for this is Kevin Joe jury

685
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,730
and he often talks about putting the

686
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:11,590
plant out in the Sun to veg you know

687
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,509
like not letting it flower cuz obviously

688
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:15,970
you don't have a clone anymore what do

689
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:18,308
you think about this and how important

690
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:21,400
is it to have that Suns role in

691
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:25,058
revitalizing the clone it's huge it's

692
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,298
definitely huge but the most important

693
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:31,269
thing is to have a good mother room I'm

694
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:34,150
talking like everything most people out

695
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:35,980
here just put into a you know the flower

696
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,360
room you know most people kind of keep

697
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,329
their mom's shitty and that's what I

698
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,548
think deteriorates um you want a good

699
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:44,740
not a light on them you want good

700
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:47,139
ventilation you want good humidity

701
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,480
levels you need a lot of right light to

702
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,009
keep those old clones on edging you

703
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,289
don't I'm under some weak light you want

704
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:56,079
some serious light over top of them and

705
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,700
you know some you're gonna notice they

706
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,460
like to be off to the side a little bit

707
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,889
more but

708
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,440
a majority that all clones need a lot of

709
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:06,019
light a lot of food a lot of foliar

710
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,788
feeding I think helps you know

711
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,710
regenerate these old clones because a

712
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:11,058
lot of times they have weak root systems

713
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,590
you know and it's hard for those old

714
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:14,599
clothes to root and when they just

715
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:17,168
barely root and they pop out these weak

716
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:20,808
root systems that they're never gonna

717
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:26,028
regenerate without a foliar feeding and

718
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:32,240
I folio speed coconut a low on calcium

719
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:35,388
25 a lot of compost tea earthworm stuff

720
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,519
fresh extractions and just alternate

721
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:40,519
between all those things to get all the

722
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,980
nutrients in there and I think that's

723
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,990
crucial is the foliar feed Amin and then

724
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,849
I think that helps them you know get the

725
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,419
nutrient dense and then your next round

726
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:53,240
of cuttings will be much healthier okay

727
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:56,090
and so we often hear about specifically

728
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,339
aloe and kelp having a lot of really

729
00:31:56,089 --> 00:32:01,249
beneficial hormones in them I mean more

730
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:03,288
specifically aloe has the salicylic acid

731
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:05,419
which stimulates the plants immune

732
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:07,148
system which in turn has a big effect on

733
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:10,070
kind of the whole rejuvenation process

734
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:11,628
how long do you feel you need to be

735
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:13,189
doing this before it's gonna work

736
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:15,498
because I remember I was talking to

737
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,119
skunk VI about it and I was like yeah

738
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:19,190
man you need to start using some alloy

739
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:20,928
to help rejuvenate it and he was like

740
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,700
awesome I'm gonna start doing that but

741
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,350
then the conversation was kind of like

742
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,090
well how long do I have to use it the

743
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:27,918
firmest not to say effects and things

744
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:29,868
like that so how long do you think it

745
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,909
would take through treating him I'm

746
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:34,329
really good giving her all these kind of

747
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:36,559
folio fades and all the the good things

748
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,939
when would you expect to start to see

749
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,788
some positive improvements on a

750
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,860
sad-looking clone so to speak every

751
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:44,868
clone is different sometimes it'll snap

752
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:47,028
right around after first few foliar

753
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:50,928
feeding sometimes it'll take a month or

754
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:53,569
two but you gotta be consistent with

755
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:56,149
putting those products and I I didn't

756
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:59,928
mentioned the kelp and the kelp is huge

757
00:32:56,148 --> 00:33:02,538
and um dragonfly natural medicines

758
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:06,950
natural mystic is huge getting that

759
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:08,720
sauce in there and just uh you know

760
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,759
alternating it up so that you did

761
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,579
everything in there is I think really

762
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:15,890
important

763
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:17,599
so if we were to just jump back to how

764
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,059
you were talking about keeping a mother

765
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,459
room really healthy that brought up this

766
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:24,558
idea in my head of what should you do

767
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,170
should you make your mother room a

768
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,928
priority such that you say alright I'm

769
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,789
gonna have a smaller mother room or for

770
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:34,400
example less plants in there and I'll

771
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:36,259
try to cater to them better and then

772
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,490
it's you know like that trade-off it's

773
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,740
like alright well I won't be able to

774
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,779
keep as many clones but I'll try to keep

775
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,609
the ones I do keep better health do you

776
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:46,849
think that's kind of a philosophy you

777
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:50,209
would advocate or do you think yes yep

778
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:53,259
a hundred percent if you cram too many

779
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:56,660
of them in there and you know you start

780
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:59,240
making your favorite ones a special and

781
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,340
suffer just for a random clones you're

782
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,980
shooting yourself in the foot and to be

783
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:05,539
honest with you keeping mothers like

784
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,789
this and all these different clones is

785
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:09,889
not financially benefit at all you know

786
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,840
you know people making money or the

787
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:16,099
people or mono crop in the newest latest

788
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,829
flavor so you know you really just keep

789
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,690
as many as you can keep healthy and you

790
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:22,789
know that's why I'm pretty ruthless on

791
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,280
them I'll call them if I don't like them

792
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:27,739
I don't keep everything I just try to

793
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,169
keep the rare things and everything else

794
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,069
I want to smoke and a few close friends

795
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:34,158
around me

796
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:37,580
want to smoke but you know I do have

797
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,269
about 80 strains that are certified in

798
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:42,710
my MA I got a bunch of the testing -

799
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:44,628
okay and so that raises a bit of a

800
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,550
peripheral idea I've had on my mind for

801
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:47,868
a while now you mentioned the idea if

802
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,850
the people making the money the ones

803
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:51,679
montemagno cropping I've said this for a

804
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:54,079
long time I've in fact almost come up

805
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,030
with my own analogy saying at the end of

806
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,819
a harvest you've got kind of two results

807
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,220
you can have one somebod you can like

808
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,080
maybe sell it for some money or you can

809
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:04,789
have new clones because you've grown out

810
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,559
seeds and you've kind of seen or hunted

811
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:09,289
them and you sacrifice that mono crop

812
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:12,500
yield to kind of find your new elite

813
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:14,239
clone so to speak with that in mind how

814
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,820
should people be rewarded for finding

815
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,049
seeds you know a lot of people criticize

816
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,510
people who want to charge money for

817
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:23,480
clones but at the same time it's kind of

818
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,070
like if I spent a whole cycle running

819
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,059
seeds and at the end of it I find one

820
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,070
elite client

821
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:31,039
and in that same time period you do a

822
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,900
mono crop and make $30,000 is it kind of

823
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,489
not analogous like isn't that clone I

824
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,829
found kind of not you know what I mean

825
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:38,359
like I've traded the potential 30,000 or

826
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:41,360
you know whatever the money value of the

827
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,410
crop was to find that Klein you know

828
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,660
what I mean so how do people get

829
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:46,699
rewarded for that it's given that people

830
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:49,119
don't seem to like the idea of you know

831
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:52,099
people charging lots of money for clones

832
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,839
well you know in my book you know anyone

833
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:57,710
that's you know hunting is highly

834
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:01,160
respected and anybody that you know it's

835
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:03,380
putting in work to help progress you

836
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:06,259
know rather than just ride coattails

837
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:08,269
you know rewarded or not you know even

838
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,160
if they don't find that amazing you know

839
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:13,009
you know putting in a work and help them

840
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,440
progress it and save old stuff is you

841
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:17,090
know should be rewarded you know um you

842
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,519
know like you said you know some of

843
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,890
these clones you know are worth a lot of

844
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,960
money I personally never sell them no

845
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:25,879
matter how much money someone comes at

846
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,000
me with and I've turned down some

847
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,730
ridiculous amounts but you know I'll pay

848
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,289
money to buy him you know I think I mean

849
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,909
- I'll pay money to get them into my

850
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:36,320
hands you know but at that point we'll

851
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:39,619
never sell them again I'll just give

852
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,190
them out to friends and trade once it's

853
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:45,139
trade yeah ok so that calm is kind of

854
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:48,440
like suggests like we need to value

855
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:50,239
these community members who are you know

856
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,659
really doing that feeder hunting for us

857
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,250
and I wouldn't say you know like give

858
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:57,230
thanks because I mean they produce have

859
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,579
a bit more than that but yeah maybe do

860
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,139
you feel that's an issue do you feel the

861
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:02,869
people who are doing the hard yards in

862
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:04,670
the industry to get the credit you know

863
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:06,259
like I said they're doing my book and

864
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,269
you know I think we should keep it that

865
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,490
way you know keep it old-school and

866
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:13,159
mostly only deal with people that are

867
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:15,199
near school is you know you're trying to

868
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,359
get into this game now because it's

869
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,879
legal in America and make a bunch of

870
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,280
money because you see dollar signs and

871
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,840
you think it's fun and exciting I don't

872
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,160
really want to deal with you I you know

873
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,720
I want to deal with the people that have

874
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:29,899
been risking their lives but in work

875
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,839
their whole [ __ ] life and so it's

876
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,550
kind of a bit of a final question on the

877
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,620
bigger falling off over time thing in

878
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,000
relation to plants you mentioned the

879
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:39,469
different genetics fall off at different

880
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,449
rates however

881
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:44,209
do you find that there's a commonality

882
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:46,369
between clones losing vigor in that they

883
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,900
tend to lose certain traits first you

884
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:51,440
know I've commonly heard that flavor

885
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,389
falls off but I'm sorry flavor falls off

886
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,130
first you know do you find that's true

887
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:56,869
or do you find some strains no like

888
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,099
maybe the vigor falls off but the

889
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:02,599
flavors still there or something like

890
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:04,789
that no I agree with that the flavor and

891
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,309
the smell are the first things to

892
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:10,639
disappear and you know they'll still get

893
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:12,469
you high but they don't taste as magical

894
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,650
as they did you know a lot of these

895
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:17,509
strengths I have from the nineties so

896
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:20,000
with that being said do you think you

897
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,730
know so the the poster child the camp 91

898
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,139
the you know kind of not to give it a

899
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,090
bad name because it's still my favorite

900
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:27,289
word but like you know it's deteriorated

901
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,900
over the years a lot of people say that

902
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:32,210
you people say the potency is still the

903
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,280
same though but wouldn't logic suggests

904
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,019
that the potency is reduced because we

905
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,180
know that you know the more terpenes

906
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:39,590
there are the more synergistic that is

907
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:41,449
with the high and for me at least them

908
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,400
the more Turkey is the the more potent

909
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:46,210
it is to a certain extent so in that

910
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,760
regard has a not lost a bit of potency

911
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:52,670
well on my opinion with these old clones

912
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,650
um to make them knock them out of the

913
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,019
ballpark to get them you know to their

914
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,840
old-school vigor and best it's not gonna

915
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:02,449
happen every round even with a healthy

916
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,519
clone but I feel like you know sometimes

917
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:06,710
I can knock those old clones out where

918
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:09,170
they're better than anything new so it's

919
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:11,360
you know it just is not as easy and

920
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,610
that's not it you can't do it over every

921
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,370
round but it you know sometimes I'll

922
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,230
turn out just as good as ever

923
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:20,659
okay so I kind of jumped back a bit in

924
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:24,530
time now when did you first decide you

925
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:27,649
wanted to start breeding um when I first

926
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:30,790
got those kind bud seeds at that fish

927
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:34,700
New Year's Eve I was turning from 94 to

928
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:36,980
95 and I wanted to have more kind but

929
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:39,710
seeds you know I was you know I never

930
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,780
had a lot of money and getting a bunch

931
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,599
of packs from Amsterdam less you know it

932
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,610
just it seemed like too much and to

933
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:49,099
actually get seeds from a sack you know

934
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,320
that I buy I own a lot you know was a

935
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:52,358
lot easier and I I just wanted to keep

936
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,019
those around

937
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:58,328
and unfortunately I didn't keep on PR

938
00:39:56,018 --> 00:40:00,129
across them onto a strain from southern

939
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,048
Virginia and you know occur that's the

940
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,970
next year and those work great but if I

941
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,798
would have you know kept that lime chair

942
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,419
it would have been something special it

943
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:10,179
was really good

944
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:13,180
stony purple indica you know nice

945
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:18,328
Afghani and so when did you make the

946
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:21,998
transition to indoors when I gotten

947
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:23,710
mentored by a couple friends that are

948
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:26,078
the guys that actually popped that

949
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,909
Fairfax four-way seat there were really

950
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,700
good friends of mine and they had a

951
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:33,129
house that you know and I learned how to

952
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:34,778
do it like that you know and you know

953
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,450
luckily always taught right from the

954
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:40,088
start you know as far as when to take it

955
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:42,308
inside because my outdoor [ __ ] was

956
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:44,170
ridiculous or obnoxiously it was suck to

957
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:47,859
do all that inside with all that risk

958
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:52,778
and power bill and stuff back east yeah

959
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:55,150
and so just as a bit of trivia one what

960
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:56,768
do you think was kind of the silliest

961
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,079
thing you guys were doing back there

962
00:40:56,768 --> 00:41:00,669
indoors that you thought was like gonna

963
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,720
make the plant better but maybe in

964
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:05,829
retrospect you're like are we thinking

965
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,078
to be honest with you

966
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,269
those guys were taught by some you know

967
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,269
people that neither [ __ ] the only thing

968
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:16,209
I was able to bring to the game with

969
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:18,008
them was the use of back on us and Linc

970
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,269
help to help make the weed taste better

971
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:21,429
and that's kind of reason they brought

972
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:24,548
me in is because they tasted that mom

973
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:26,828
seeds that I'd gotten from that fish

974

or along its railroad tracks and some

982

1009
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:01,480
cheese sandwiches you know and I'm

1010
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:02,619
talking we could get the butter we could

1011
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,719
get the cheese and we could get the

1012
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:06,849
bread and we used to turn that it in to

1013
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:11,439
enough money in the parking lot to good

1014

00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:19,960
awesome

1018
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:21,880
so that whole time we kind of thinking

1019
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,409
to yourself I need to get these cans of

1020
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,829
genetics for when I want to breed with

1021
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:27,548
it

1022
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:28,720
Oh to be honest with you man I never

1023
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:31,798
even thought of that

1024
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:35,230
but me and chem dog had a good friend

1025
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:38,469
mutual friend between us and that it was

1026
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:40,990
a true hustler and he was smart enough

1027
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:42,989
to keep our crew separate because of

1028
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:45,639
that way he could get the Kim dog from

1029
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:49,118
Kim dog and you could get the for away

1030
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:51,460
from us haha and he did that and he did

1031
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,318
that successfully and it's a you know

1032
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,349
fine cuz I'm we were at a lot of shows I

1033
00:43:53,318 --> 00:44:02,619

is we just kind of a personal friend

1041
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,510

1042
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,660

1043
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:25,950

1053
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,849
hear a lot of people claim that you know

1054
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,110
that was the best weed they've ever

1055
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:56,309

1056

but boy yes you degenerated haha so

1057
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:59,519
scrolling through some of your earlier

1058
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,920
posts on instagrams we see things like

1059
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,780
the ominous itís wrong is that the pune

1060
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:11,820
bada cookies how do you say yes yeah

1061
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:15,380
peanut butter so Hawaiian heroin strain

1062
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:19,289
and keg you've got those seeds from a

1063
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:21,300
friend of his and this is before I was

1064
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:24,179
in coastal seats and he gave them to

1065
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:28,320
Bollywood BAM Bollywood BAM he made that

1066
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:30,359
cross and that peanut butters um really

1067
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,420
stabilized the cookies and there's some

1068
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,190
fire to be found in that and I think we

1069
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,250
just sold out of the last packs and

1070
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,380
that's that yeah so hopefully someone

1071
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,960
will keep a card so how would you

1072
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,880
describe the influence of like Hawaiian

1073
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,019
land race / heirloom strains because

1074
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,789
it's one of those ones where there's not

1075
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,820
a ton of information on it you know some

1076
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:52,769
people say oh she couch comes from the

1077
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,809
creepy which is a Hawaiian strain and

1078
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:56,670
then on the other hand you've got like

1079
00:45:54,809 --> 00:45:58,860
the Molokai Frost which is you know

1080
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,360
another Hawaiian strain which doesn't

1081
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,190
seem to be overly similar to the

1082
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,099
supposed creepy how would you describe

1083
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,659
the Hawaiian land race in general and

1084
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,279
then what would you describe that the

1085
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:13,079
Puna butter kind of brings to the

1086
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:15,960
cookies it stabilizes it didn't throw

1087
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,989
many horns you know cookies throws a lot

1088
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,720
of homes and - peanut butter cookies in

1089
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:24,029
our testing throat zero and we sold a

1090
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:25,889
lot of seeds and I'm sure there was a

1091
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:29,010
few in there but we didn't really hear

1092
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:31,730
any complaints over so that's what the

1093
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:34,470
main thing I brought to the table

1094
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:37,320
cake you really respects those old

1095
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:40,769
strains you know right before I became

1096
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:43,200
the coastal they lost the Maui Wowi you

1097
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:45,599
know and keg you was real sore about

1098
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,019
that for a long time the old brotherhood

1099
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,029
strain and he has high regard for the

1100
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:53,909
Hawaiian heirlooms cuz he actually got

1101
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,410
to smoke them in their heyday so you

1102
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:56,969
know I was a young kid on the East Coast

1103
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:59,549
so I really don't know much about that

1104
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:02,669
you know it's kind of I'm seeing some

1105
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:05,789
now - luckily working with coastal and

1106
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:08,700
keg you nice and say how would you

1107
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:10,469
describe coastal seeds because I guess

1108
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:12,179
it's kind of different from a few

1109
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:14,069
companies as a few people who braid

1110
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:16,139
under the banner of it but it seems like

1111
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:19,500
the overall project is you know land

1112
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:23,369
rice / heirlooms how do you think of

1113
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:26,880
coastal seeds so to speak well coastal

1114
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:31,139
suits as Hannibal Kade you first he

1115
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,300
started it it took Bollywood BAM as the

1116
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:36,420
first people to do work with keg you and

1117
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:42,030
then they brought me in and Hannibal and

1118
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:45,750
and um kqs and og you know he's 72 years

1119
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:49,140
old he's been growing since 1969

1120
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:53,489
so me and bam just look at him you know

1121
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:55,679
just as a you know like a mentor and you

1122
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:57,539
know just door were lucky to be able to

1123
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,269
work with teachin acts he has in the

1124
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:02,130
help help him do this work you know

1125
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:04,409
cousin when you're so need to you know

1126
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,079
like becomes a lot little harder than

1127
00:48:04,409 --> 00:48:08,399
when you're in your pond and he's got

1128
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,799
all these to nedick's and that's

1129
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,160
actually the main reason I joined just

1130
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,510
because he had all these awesome tunics

1131
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,579
and I wanted to cross him to all these

1132
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:21,050
awesome old clones I had and I wanted to

1133
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:23,460
help them keep these strange pure and

1134
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,500
soon as I dug into the vault

1135
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,920
you know first things that you know

1136
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,329
grabbed my interest were on the Northern

1137
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,369
Lights number one it's kind of

1138
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:34,049
disappeared it was quality you know

1139
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:38,519
top-of-the-line we when I was a kid and

1140
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:41,760
also the m10 that's the second thing he

1141
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:44,920
got that from a friend of his in Santa

1142
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,290
Cruz jr. and that's some [ __ ] call

1143
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,579
it's also known as Afghani number one

1144
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:51,219
and you know those strains are pretty

1145
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:54,759
much not around anymore not in quality

1146
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:57,429
form and I was very excited to see that

1147
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,520
both those lines were exactly like I

1148
00:48:57,429 --> 00:49:04,029
remembered and you know it was very cool

1149
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:06,759
and coastal seats is you know KQ is

1150
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,860
trying to grow the old land race pure

1151
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,960
ones because those are the the things he

1152
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,970
remembers when he was a kid and those

1153
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,280
are what he wants to smoke you know I'm

1154
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:18,189
trying to bring back the indicas um

1155
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,560
Bollywood BAM is on he's really in a

1156
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,800
flavorful food and exotic flavors and

1157
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,900
tastes and his favorite leads to Arkell

1158
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,539
and you know he's gonna breed for what

1159
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:31,630
he likes cake he was gonna breed for

1160
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:34,480
what he likes and a boat's gonna select

1161
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,430
for what she likes and you know I want

1162
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,260
to breed indicus you know and that's

1163
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:40,419
kind of what I'm gonna concentrate on

1164
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,720
after I finish those two classic

1165
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,030
Amsterdam strains I'm gonna work with

1166
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:50,500
all the land race indicus he has and

1167
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:54,490
also working with the Panama red that he

1168
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,829
had and they keep Ruffino out of the

1169
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:59,109
selection after we had had it for a year

1170
00:49:56,829 --> 00:50:01,150
and I grew it on other people Raven how

1171
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,130
good it was and take you sent it to the

1172
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,720
lab and to our surprise it was the

1173
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:07,059
two-two-one seaweed he dominant and

1174
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,919
right around that same time he was doing

1175
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:10,539
it he had just done an open pollination

1176
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,180
and when he does a kampala nation he

1177
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:15,400
marks all the females and keeps them

1178
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:20,049
separated and uses as many males as he

1179
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:23,440
can and the last summer in August my dog

1180
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:26,050
got cancer and I you know I wanted to

1181
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:30,039
treat her with everything I could and

1182
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:32,560
CBD it was one of them so I was inspired

1183
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:34,900
by that and I went to one that gave you

1184
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,110
and I said you know give me the give me

1185
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:41,079
100 seats out of the CBD dominant FINA

1186
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:43,450
and I'm gonna work it and I I took him

1187
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,400
and I grown and everyone that wasn't see

1188
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:48,779
but he diamond and I killed except for

1189
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,820
one that was Chi hcve it had a

1190
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,950
ridiculous amount and the ratios we

1191
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,539
never sent it the finished product to

1192
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:58,759
the lab yet we must don't do that but

1193
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:01,130
the leaf sample that people

1194
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,310
steep hill top Bollywood bam that this

1195
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,289
is special and they also sold Bollywood

1196
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:08,059
BAM when he took the leaf samples and

1197
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:13,279
cozy gels with labs and stuff like that

1198
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:16,429
that three or four of the CBD females

1199
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:19,609
and one of the male's had really really

1200
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:22,159
high ratios of CVG and those are in the

1201
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:25,429
open pollination too and one was

1202
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:27,739
definitely a male and really excited to

1203
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:31,489
be able to bring that pure landrace CBD

1204
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:35,719
um to the public and keg you actually

1205
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:37,639
just sent some to file those so you know

1206
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:39,919
we're pretty sure it's just gonna start

1207
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:42,469
its own galaxy so they'll be now debate

1208
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,570
you know it's its own land race CBD you

1209
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:47,480
know and gonna be excited to release

1210
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:50,119
that to the public this fall after it's

1211
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:54,139
tested you know I did I open pollination

1212
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:56,930
like like eight boys and um twelve to

1213
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:59,118
sixteen females I you know the about

1214
00:51:56,929 --> 00:52:01,669
sixty out of the hundred were CBD

1215
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,108
dominant and and any ones that were weak

1216
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:07,099
I called off and I just opened

1217
00:52:03,108 --> 00:52:10,219
pollinated the rest so when you first

1218
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:12,200
did the CBD so I when K GU first did the

1219
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:14,389
CBD open pollination do you remember

1220
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:17,210
what type of percentage of acidity

1221
00:52:14,389 --> 00:52:20,659
trades there because a lot of people

1222
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:22,940
often reference the the older land race

1223
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:25,068
strains there was like potentially a

1224
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,650
reasonably high proportion of them the

1225
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:29,690
hyde CBD in there and it was kind of

1226
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,980
selectively bred out do you find that

1227
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:32,780
that was the case or do you think that

1228
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,969
that selective breeding took a much

1229
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:39,170
longer process than just kind of recent

1230
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:41,000
years so to speak well but that was

1231
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,349
probably the case because you know back

1232
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,480
in the day they just said hey this

1233
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:48,140
didn't get me as high [ __ ] let's kill

1234
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,539
this thing they selected that as their

1235
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:52,639
keeper cut before I was in coastal seeds

1236
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:54,829
and you know I was able to just grow it

1237
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,960
when I'm joined and I found out how

1238
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:58,880
special it was I told keg you this is as

1239
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,480
good as anything I got I brought some to

1240
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,220
the Emerald cup two years ago and spoke

1241
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,699
to that people with the Coastal's booth

1242
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:09,578
and everyone raved about it and at that

1243
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:12,289
time we didn't know is CBD dominant and

1244
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:15,050
most of mine see we do element in that

1245
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:16,730
and that in that line but that you know

1246
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:20,720
that one mother that was CBD dominant

1247
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:24,079
her safety 60% of her offspring were and

1248
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:25,730
we're seeing now that I took just CBD

1249
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,829
dominant males invite him to just see be

1250
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:30,469
dominant females on the next open

1251
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:34,250
pollination of locking down the CBD

1252
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:37,039
genetics or seeing higher ratios and on

1253
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:40,489
it it's exciting you know it's a it's a

1254
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:42,769
very good line because of what I've seen

1255
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:46,579
in Elaine race so far as you know some

1256
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:49,340
good bad and ugly and this stuff is good

1257
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:50,869
weed um it like that that we found out

1258
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,450
just because we kept that clone around

1259
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:56,719
to smoke and it's gonna be cool to share

1260
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:59,389
with everybody yes I think it was Bodhi

1261
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,819
who said that he found it was kind of

1262
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:02,629
like being a little bit higher and a bit

1263
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,700
on tequila

1264
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:06,410
having the CBD Panama how would you

1265
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:09,529
describe the effects to people and I

1266
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:11,869
guess the the extrapolation of that is

1267
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,430
when you do get it sequenced and you

1268
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:14,989
know it's it's only animation or you got

1269
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:17,419
the proof do you think that'll it'll

1270
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:19,429
open the doorway to a new type of high

1271
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,320
kind of like what Bodhi referenced in

1272
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:22,819
that you know you don't get but these

1273
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,350
days it makes you feel like you know I

1274
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:26,150
caught it I think tequila wait you know

1275
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:28,130
that's not really common do you think

1276
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:30,849
that it could open the door to a whole

1277
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:33,380
new type of high in that regard

1278
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:36,980
you know this all Android strands are

1279
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:38,990
definitely unique on high um I need to

1280
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,969
get some pictures up on my Instagram

1281
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:42,649
account but you know it's not the

1282
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:45,439
prettiest stuff it's for the sativa

1283
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:46,010
lovers it's long flowering long skinny

1284
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,750
buds

1285
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:57,080
um very chirping rich slimmer similar to

1286
00:54:50,750 --> 00:55:00,440
haze summer cherry and lemon but cakey

1287
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:03,049
one says it is the best drain to give

1288
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,059
him two munchies right now and I Grove

1289
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:07,660
Ottaway and I give him whatever he needs

1290
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:10,730
for um because he just got over cancer

1291
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:11,420
when he was younger he just loves to

1292
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,579
Tevas

1293
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:17,119
he loves it to us and then when he got

1294
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:19,610
sick he really got to appreciate these

1295
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,650
strong into cuz I have because he said

1296
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,680
they just helped his pain you know like

1297
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:26,000
the Black Diamond the chem dog d LG

1298
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:28,519
coaches and

1299
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,650
it was cool to be able to introduce some

1300
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:33,559
to the Australians at that time in his

1301
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:34,099
life when he needed them yeah without a

1302
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:38,529
doubt

1303
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:41,599
and so do you think that the use of CBD

1304
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:43,790
treatment in conjunction with say

1305
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:48,830
chemotherapy for example is more

1306
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:50,900
effective than CBD on its own yes you

1307
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:53,230
know what I did what the dog was

1308
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:56,960
chemotherapy treatment

1309
00:55:53,230 --> 00:56:01,809
combined with we did four to one CBD

1310
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:04,940
dominant 40-pound dog she was getting

1311
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:11,449
about a hundred milligrams and at first

1312
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:13,070
it was 75% CBD and then 25% THC and we

1313
00:56:11,449 --> 00:56:15,739
kept it like that for a long time

1314
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:18,440
and at that same period I was taking

1315
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:24,019
just pure CBD oil and robbing it all

1316
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:29,000
over her belly and her armpits and so um

1317
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:31,429
she's still on the 25% CBD 75 percent

1318
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,780
THC right now and she had a hell of a

1319
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:40,279
tolerance gosh you know she got cleared

1320
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:42,560
up for a cancer and in January and we've

1321
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,599
kept her on you know just for safety

1322
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,750
facts because you came and noticed she's

1323
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,430
high um she's got a very strong

1324
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,469
tolerance you know I know I'm a grown

1325
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:54,588
man that can't handle you know 75

1326
00:56:51,469 --> 00:56:58,069
milligrams of THC you know and she gets

1327
00:56:54,588 --> 00:57:00,469
25 of us gve and I give it to her and

1328
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:04,160
just to keep the cancer away because she

1329
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:07,368
had lymphoma and they said it was you

1330
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:09,289
know very close to stage four and they

1331
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:11,390
were pretty shocked by the end of her

1332
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:14,000
chemotherapy first round that she'd came

1333
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:17,569
in the heat and they said that was

1334
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,769
extremely rare yeah well that's a good

1335
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:23,330
outcome while we're on the topic of dogs

1336
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:26,599
on your Instagram you got a fighter and

1337
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:28,309
you it says headband underdog I thought

1338
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:33,250
there were two different strains or are

1339
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:38,230
they the same so you know weasel and

1340
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:39,769
Sandow and crew out there they had a

1341
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,449
strain that

1342
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:44,750
all those same names this is not that

1343
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:48,469
same string this is a very good OG Kush

1344
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:51,079
cut and alum with the headbands there is

1345
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:54,319
a lot of confusion like my friend not so

1346
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:57,079
dog has that headband from a mutual

1347
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:00,019
friend of mine all quality over quantity

1348
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:02,360
of it to him years ago and we've all

1349
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:04,389
known each other unknown quality for

1350
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:09,349
quantity forever but I I'm no nonsense

1351
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:11,690
dog since like 2006 and will its endured

1352
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:15,079
she's got three headbands now on one's

1353
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:17,710
loom post one is the one from us and one

1354
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:21,920
is Mandelbrot's and you know DNA

1355
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:25,610
released a 707 and um swerve really

1356
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,170
really stuff I had been and you know so

1357
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:30,380
there's so many headbands and that's

1358
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:32,630
just so confusing but the one I have is

1359
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:37,309
that I feel like the best OG Kush cut

1360
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:39,079
there is so on the history of oh jeez

1361
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:41,599
we commonly hear that the TK is the

1362
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:43,279
original but I mean it's still not

1363
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,690
confirmed you know there's still a lot

1364
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,050
of people who dispute that what do you

1365
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:51,590
think the origins are well I think it's

1366
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:54,230
very interesting that Josh DS cut the

1367
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:56,059
one also known as the ghost cuz I is the

1368
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:59,000
guy that shared it on over girl with a

1369
00:58:56,059 --> 00:59:01,460
lot of people the ghost OG the Josh D

1370
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,769
the one that he took down to Southern

1371
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:07,519
California that got was called cushion

1372
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:09,440
Florida the cathode G named og cush in

1373
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:13,190
Southern California you know I think

1374
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:16,190
that's the oldest one um I think it's

1375
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:18,349
very you know there's something behind

1376
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:21,320
it because that and the TK both came

1377
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:25,400
from Florida and they're both amazing

1378
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:28,390
cuts and um some of the best I have any

1379
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,400
you of the opinion that it's most likely

1380
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:34,279
heavily Afghani landrace in origin or

1381
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,289
maybe a cross and hybridized a bit

1382
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,170
further before the public got their

1383
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:42,969
hands on it you know I think it's

1384
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:46,280
Afghani I'm dominant announcer got going

1385
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:50,719
very round and dense that the high is

1386
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:52,120
very strong you know kind of indica but

1387
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,129
on

1388
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:56,259
you know it's a good question I think

1389
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:58,390
time will tell I think it eventually

1390
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,010
will come to light exactly what it is

1391
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:02,259
you know I think it probably went back

1392
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:03,940
to Northern Lights because before I G

1393
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:09,310
cush the best strains were Northern

1394
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:13,900
Lights okay and so I read online that

1395
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:15,489
you could harvest TK at 12 weeks and so

1396
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,660
I asked Duke about that and I was like

1397
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:18,549
what's to go with that I thought it was

1398
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:20,230
like 10 weeks then he goes are ya like

1399
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:21,880
some strains I've got like two windows

1400
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,409
so to speak you know like it like peaks

1401
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,750
at 10 weeks that's a good time to take

1402
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:27,969
it then 11 weeks you know not so good

1403
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,710
then 12 weeks you know gets good again

1404
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:31,179
and I was thinking I've never really

1405
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,750
heard of that before you know I don't

1406
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:34,329
doubt it

1407
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,469
but do you have any kind of you know

1408
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:37,480
personal experience with things like

1409
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:42,309
that or have you heard of an idea like

1410
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:44,170
that well those are oh geez and chem

1411
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:47,019
dogs are some of my favorite strains to

1412
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:49,240
grow and I feel like the longer you can

1413
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:51,730
keep them healthy and they're green and

1414
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:54,159
still growing and you know not starting

1415
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:56,079
to die off and catabolize themselves the

1416
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:58,539
better they're gonna be you know I like

1417
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:02,860
to take home definitely seventy days you

1418
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:04,989
know if not 77 so I like the long window

1419
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,780
I've always liked the the stronger one

1420
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:10,319
oncotic I have all those strings and not

1421
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:13,300
too long to you let him go to more

1422
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,559
better the buzz in my opinion a lot of

1423
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,300
the Northern Lights are the same way

1424
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,159
that you want Benny to go like ten weeks

1425
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:21,250
a lot of those old clones like I have

1426
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:24,730
like black domina and the dumpster um

1427
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:26,380
they need to go and what is the dumpster

1428
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:28,059
we've read a little bit about it online

1429
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:30,550
I've seen it on your Instagram there's

1430
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:32,949
not a whole lot of information you know

1431
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:34,690
I've heard two backstories and they're

1432
01:01:32,949 --> 01:01:38,349
kind of similar um came from the

1433
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:41,230
University of Ohio campus one story was

1434
01:01:38,349 --> 01:01:43,420
a guy went into a bar and he he was

1435
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:45,070
having a celebration drinking he's you

1436
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:47,050
know he's like I'm not by around you

1437
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:48,730
know I just almost got busted the cops

1438
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,960
were onto me and I took everything I

1439
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:51,820
threw it in the dumpster

1440
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,829
he was like I'm buying everyone around

1441
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,870
they didn't catch me and some of the

1442
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:58,329
guys in the bar were like what dumpster

1443
01:01:55,869 --> 01:02:00,309
and then I've also heard another story

1444
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:04,000
where someone actually did get busted

1445
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:05,739
and the cops it was early in the back in

1446
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,260
the day and they just maybe through

1447
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:11,379
the weed in the dumpster and someone

1448
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:14,860
pulled a clone out who saw the lights

1449
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:21,369
and stuff but it's rumored to be a old G

1450
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:23,740
13 NL or a G 13 Shiva skunk and I see a

1451
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:25,660
lot of Northern Lights in it um I think

1452
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:28,629
it's Northern Lights something

1453
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:30,759
and what's your you know kind of

1454
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:33,519
hypothesis on the history of the real G

1455
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,320
13 you know we I'm kind of sick of

1456
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:37,409
hearing that story about the University

1457
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:42,039
thing like I just don't think it's true

1458
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:44,079
well you know cake you told me about he

1459
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,389
grew up in Santa Cruz and lived their

1460
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:49,329
whole life he told me about this girl

1461
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:53,650
and he just said up north and he said

1462
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:56,259
her name was hash cake patty and back in

1463
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:58,300
the day they used to the smugglers the

1464
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:01,180
Brotherhood and everyone else would

1465
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:03,970
smuggle hash in surfboards and and

1466
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:06,099
whatnot and um they were smashed and

1467
01:03:03,969 --> 01:03:10,329
that's why she was called hash cake

1468
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:12,880
patty and he said that she had heard

1469
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:15,069
about the government growing g13 and she

1470
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,010
just turned some seeds she found out of

1471
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:20,019
some Afghani hash and called it she 13

1472
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:22,030
for marketing you know I don't not

1473
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:24,639
saying that's true but it you know it

1474
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:27,070
really makes a lot of sense and you know

1475
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:30,429
he's very old-school and everything you

1476
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:33,940
see from the government is a very sativa

1477
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:36,519
plant in g13 that Neville bred with was

1478
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:39,700
a very Afghani plant you know similar to

1479
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:42,070
what the story keg you said about hash

1480
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:43,750
cake patty finding the seats and the

1481
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:45,640
Brotherhood's hash it they brought back

1482
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:48,579
in his surfboard it was smashed out

1483
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:50,529
yeah killer so while we're on the topic

1484
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:52,029
of the Brotherhood it's kind of

1485
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:54,609
something I haven't mentioned a whole

1486
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:56,530
lot but as time goes by it feels like

1487
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:57,909
they're becoming more and more important

1488
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:59,590
in the whole history of things

1489
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:01,029
what can you kind of tell us about the

1490
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:06,510
Brotherhood and what you knew about

1491
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:09,730
their contributions original smugglers

1492
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:12,160
you know I you know heard rumors that

1493
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:14,289
some of the guys that did the endless

1494
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,059
summer were part of that you know and

1495
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:18,940
you know that's when they learned his

1496
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:21,639
smuggle stuff back in surfboards

1497
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:23,619
and um you know later grew so big that

1498
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:25,838
they were buying brand-new Mercedes Benz

1499
01:04:23,619 --> 01:04:27,940
and VW goes out of Germany and shipping

1500
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:31,420
them over at Afghanistan and I'm filled

1501
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:34,240
with hash and and and weed and taking

1502
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:36,250
that to California and then driving

1503
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:39,068
those cars already loaded with stuff to

1504
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:42,088
the college universities and supplying

1505
01:04:39,068 --> 01:04:44,259
the weed that wasn't available and

1506
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:47,670
they're the first guys that brought

1507
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:50,319
indicas into America is what I heard and

1508
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:53,619
before that they were bringing Mexican

1509
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:55,989
sativas and they are also brought a lot

1510
01:04:53,619 --> 01:05:00,369
of the Mexican sativas to the Hawaiian

1511
01:04:55,989 --> 01:05:02,679
Islands and they were just you know the

1512
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:05,588
original guys and you know anyone that

1513
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:07,509
can get any genetics you know that

1514
01:05:05,588 --> 01:05:10,179
anyone say I'd offer many of their

1515
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:13,390
imports you know that's what Kiki was

1516
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:15,848
looking for most cuz when he thinks back

1517
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:18,068
you know it was the who brought the best

1518
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:20,890
weed yes you know when he smoked stuff

1519
01:05:18,068 --> 01:05:24,190
that's who had the best you know they

1520
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:26,588
brought the Thai in there just oh jeez

1521
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:28,568
you know they paid the Weathermen break

1522
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:30,849
timothy leary out of jail

1523
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:34,809
you know when Timothy Leary was in there

1524
01:05:30,849 --> 01:05:37,660
for pot charges and they had Jimi

1525
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:40,929
Hendrix play private concerts for them

1526
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:42,608
and their property in Hawaii you know

1527
01:05:40,929 --> 01:05:44,679
who long and so do you think it's safe

1528
01:05:42,608 --> 01:05:46,449
to say that what a lot of people

1529
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:49,179
consider to be the original braid is

1530
01:05:46,449 --> 01:05:53,338
like Neverland the likes most likely got

1531
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:56,289
their stock from them oh yeah or people

1532
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:58,328
that you know got the gene X from them

1533
01:05:56,289 --> 01:06:00,940
and you know did the same thing I did

1534
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:02,950
you know just earlier in time kept the

1535
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,809
seeds alive and bred them so they could

1536
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:06,818
have more that the next year and not

1537
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:08,650
thinking of anything other than being

1538
01:06:06,818 --> 01:06:12,550
able to have good wheat the next year

1539
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:14,170
you know interesting and so something

1540
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:17,140
you may or may not be able to comment on

1541
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:19,088
is the more I research to the original

1542
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:21,608
skunk story the more this question

1543
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:24,489
becomes more you know kind of pertinent

1544
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:28,358
in my mind is in the original story that

1545
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:30,909
gets talked about they speak of how the

1546
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:32,078
original skunk it was actually a project

1547
01:06:30,909 --> 01:06:34,838
which was

1548
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:38,259
to recreate a clone that was both

1549
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:40,478
unstable and didn't breed true and that

1550
01:06:38,259 --> 01:06:42,009
was how they ended up like trying to

1551
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:43,718
recreate it I believe it was Mexican

1552
01:06:42,009 --> 01:06:45,248
cross Colombian but then they couldn't

1553
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:47,798
they couldn't recreate it even just

1554
01:06:45,248 --> 01:06:49,748
using raw landraces again

1555
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:52,809
and so they hybridized it using the

1556
01:06:49,748 --> 01:06:54,818
Afghani first and then crossed it back

1557
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:56,859
in and made what we knew as skunk number

1558
01:06:54,818 --> 01:06:59,949
one now but what I'm interested in is

1559
01:06:56,858 --> 01:07:03,389
what was really that clone that liking I

1560
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:07,028
guess the the you know progenitor skunk

1561
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:09,368
what did it what like was that Bowl

1562
01:07:07,028 --> 01:07:11,588
stock potentially like what was that you

1563
01:07:09,369 --> 01:07:14,769
know do you have any idea you know I

1564
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:18,900
really don't have any idea that would be

1565
01:07:14,768 --> 01:07:21,728
an interesting question asked aq but I

1566
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,349
think most of the stock was Brotherhood

1567
01:07:21,728 --> 01:07:25,989
back then because they were the ones

1568
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:29,259
importing most of the weed and hash into

1569
01:07:25,989 --> 01:07:31,778
America so chances are you know what

1570
01:07:29,259 --> 01:07:35,170
snacks that came from them I know the

1571
01:07:31,778 --> 01:07:41,318
guys on from sacred seeds were out of

1572
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:44,588
Santa Cruz and you know Sam you know I

1573
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:48,068
guess ratted everybody out fled - and

1574
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:53,108
with all those seeds yep

1575
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:55,119
and so a you of the opinion that Sam

1576
01:07:53,108 --> 01:07:58,420
skunk man is not a good dude

1577
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,068
I don't know I'm personally but you know

1578
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,889
it's not a good thing to narc on your

1579
01:08:00,068 --> 01:08:04,900
friends and then take your everybody's

1580
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:07,808
work and go profit off of it that's not

1581
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:10,209
[ __ ] cool yeah cuz I mean there's a

1582
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:13,059
lot of there's a lot of stories around

1583
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:14,708
you know like what I've basically heard

1584
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:16,599
is that everything people give him

1585
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:18,429
credit for bringing to the market he

1586
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:20,250
didn't actually crack he just took it

1587
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:23,230
from someone else you know like notably

1588
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:28,448
skunk and haze how do you feel about

1589
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:32,169
that you know online stuff and I've also

1590
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:34,568
heard what cake you told me and I know

1591
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:36,940
nothing about his breeding but you know

1592
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:39,429
I just turning on your friends like that

1593
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:40,829
and clean what did you next man that's

1594
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:43,929
cold-blooded

1595
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:45,759
yeah without a doubt that's you know all

1596
01:08:43,929 --> 01:08:49,989
I know about that story

1597
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:50,949
yep and so a breeder who is very near

1598
01:08:49,988 --> 01:08:53,500
and dear to my heart

1599
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:56,108
Tom Hill he releases a lot of strains

1600
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:58,750
which in many regards could have kind of

1601
01:08:56,109 --> 01:09:00,338
fallen into projects bicoastal seeds you

1602
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:02,500
know he was very much during the open

1603
01:09:00,338 --> 01:09:03,670
pollination landrace type of thing how

1604
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,189
do you view his strange to have any

1605
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:08,680
personal experience with them I have

1606
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:13,119
high regard for all of his strains and

1607
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:16,270
he was also a pioneer in thermal

1608
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:19,059
triangle on growing giant trees you know

1609
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:22,210
like really monstrous plants you know

1610
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:23,890
and there's no it's just amazing you

1611
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:28,509
know he's somebody that I would love to

1612
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:29,798
me his [ __ ] lines are amazing I hold a

1613
01:09:28,509 --> 01:09:32,439
deep chunk in high regard

1614
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:35,229
some people don't I hold it in high

1615
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:38,649
regard and um you know he put out some

1616
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:43,149
amazing work you know I love it all and

1617
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:45,250
so have you ever heard of any of the

1618
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:47,738
other lines that are not commonly

1619
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:49,210
referenced because he only ended up

1620
01:09:47,738 --> 01:09:51,429
having like I think it was like five or

1621
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:54,130
six lines for sale but like you often

1622
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:55,869
heard about other lines he worked on but

1623
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:57,940
just that they weren't released like one

1624
01:09:55,869 --> 01:10:01,329
that most notably comes to mind is he

1625
01:09:57,939 --> 01:10:03,129
did a deep chunk cross x.18 and i think

1626
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:04,630
he called that the boneyard or something

1627
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:06,159
like that but there was these other

1628
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:07,840
strains that he had made or was working

1629
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,430
on that it started to gain notoriety and

1630
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,060
like I think there was another line he

1631
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:14,680
had it was like the blue Afghani and you

1632
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:17,550
know like have you ever heard or worked

1633
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:22,300
with any of those or not really well I

1634
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:25,210
do not have the x.18 and I would love to

1635
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:28,810
get some seed stock of that I only have

1636
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:31,779
the deep chunk line and I'd also like to

1637
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:34,539
get that pine tar you know Tom Hales

1638
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:36,309
haze is also another line you know I'd

1639
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:38,260
loved it to get you know just to help

1640
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,670
you know keeping my personal seed stash

1641
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:41,680
for Oakland pollination

1642
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:43,480
you know and to keep around and share

1643
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:45,400
with friends and Tre well not

1644
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:47,829
necessarily stuff that I'd worked for

1645
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:51,789
with coastal seeds you know just stuff

1646
01:10:47,829 --> 01:10:53,680
for the preservation aspect and so have

1647
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:56,560
you ever had what you would consider to

1648
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:57,700
be a true or accurate representation of

1649
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,110
haze because it's one of those ones

1650
01:10:57,699 --> 01:10:59,389
where you know like you still get packs

1651
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:01,339
that

1652
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:03,320
say Hades but everyone who had the real

1653
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,800
stuff says like you can't really find it

1654
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:09,079
anymore like it's just not the same I

1655
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:11,270
remember the first time I tried pure

1656
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:16,789
haze it was in Trinity County at the

1657
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:20,000
tribal stomp in 1997 that og guy B Smith

1658
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:21,949
from Denny Canyon gave a talk that year

1659
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,140
and [ __ ] right in front of all those

1660
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:26,300
people he said he had like thousands of

1661
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,860
plants that were like he's a tall guy he

1662
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,710
reached over said like eight feet tall

1663
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:33,019
just right in front of the whole crowd

1664
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:35,149
police and everything I'm real pioneer

1665
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:37,610
but that same weekend I got a smoke case

1666
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:38,539
for the first time and wow it was

1667
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:41,029
[ __ ] amazing

1668
01:11:38,539 --> 01:11:44,899
and I've seen it a few times since then

1669
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:48,619
and it's definitely still there I know

1670
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:50,869
people that have original A's cuts um

1671
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:53,930
but you know I don't know anyone that

1672
01:11:50,869 --> 01:11:56,720
has seedstock of you know really good

1673
01:11:53,930 --> 01:12:00,110
old you know pure Santa Cruz pace you

1674
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:02,720
know only Amsterdam haze and when you

1675
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:05,509
make that distinction do you mean that

1676
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,260
the Amsterdam haze was worked towards

1677
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:11,390
that kind of less flavorful more kind of

1678
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:13,310
chilled out buying I mean that's what I

1679
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:16,340
commonly hear from people or is there a

1680
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:18,980
difference a different difference in

1681
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,779
your mind well you know unfortunately I

1682
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:23,419
never got to smoke the Santa Cruz haze

1683
01:12:20,779 --> 01:12:26,689
cake you actually knew one of the girls

1684
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:29,270
that shrimp for the haze brothers and he

1685
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:31,419
contacted her and you know hoping she'd

1686
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:34,310
have some seed stock you know and

1687
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:36,949
unfortunately she didn't you know it's

1688
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:38,870
you know local Santa Cruz weed I heard

1689
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:40,489
one of the brothers is still alive he's

1690
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:43,819
not in the cannabis he's in the other

1691
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:46,519
substance substances and he's into them

1692
01:12:43,819 --> 01:12:49,399
heavily unfortunately and I guess the

1693
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,680
other brother died yeah that's

1694
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:54,379
unfortunate I guess we may never know

1695
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:56,750
unless Sam decides to tell the truth the

1696
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:58,970
Pacific Northwest hash plant is one that

1697
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:01,159
exists me because I have a feeling it's

1698
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:05,510
possibly one of those same plants which

1699
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:07,880
came from the brothers blocks of hash do

1700
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:09,920
you think that's a possibility and how

1701
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,720
do you think that cut has persisted for

1702
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,980
so long it seems like it's not widely

1703
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,409
circulated

1704
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:19,698
it also seems to pop up here and there

1705
01:13:15,409 --> 01:13:22,099
at the same time boy I really wish I

1706
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:25,759
knew who held it so I could give him

1707
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:28,969
credit I'd seen that Bodie was breeding

1708
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:32,119
it with it and I'm keg you and Bodie are

1709
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:33,698
good friends and you know I told keg you

1710
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:36,229
hear here's the list

1711
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:39,198
anything he [ __ ] wants you know I

1712
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:41,299
want that cuz when I was a kid you know

1713
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:43,879
and I told you I couldn't even really

1714
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,770
afford packs of sensi seeds and to

1715
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,289
actually be able to get one of the cuts

1716
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,710
that you know Neville was breeding with

1717
01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:52,448
it

1718
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:55,609
you know this [ __ ] dream come true so

1719
01:13:52,448 --> 01:13:58,789
you know I got it and it's it's it's the

1720
01:13:55,609 --> 01:14:01,309
funk it reminds me of the the skully the

1721
01:13:58,789 --> 01:14:05,750
super skully the that the the pot cash

1722
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:08,199
plant it reminds me of the HP 13 you

1723
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:14,510
know what I've heard it is pure Afghani

1724
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:16,549
alayan race it's an amazing cut and how

1725
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:18,619
similar is it to the Skelly I mean like

1726
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:20,630
in the sense that is the hash the you

1727
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:22,670
know the pnw hash plant the same is it

1728
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:24,940
just kind of look pretty unsuspecting

1729
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:29,899
and just kind of knock you down as well

1730
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:33,379
yeah they all have the same look you

1731
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:35,839
know none of them are very resinous but

1732
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:40,190
it's the Terps and just that real good

1733
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:43,969
indica you know I grew that HP 13 back

1734
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:48,109
in in Willets with my friend quality

1735
01:14:43,969 --> 01:14:50,270
over quantity and 2006 and ended up

1736
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:52,069
dropping that in like 2008 cuz I just

1737
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:54,020
couldn't get the powdery mildew off of

1738
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:57,469
it but that was an amazing stream

1739
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:59,270
actually the most strain that I'm

1740
01:14:57,469 --> 01:15:00,079
looking for the most right now I want

1741
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:04,150
that one the most

1742
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:07,550
it's amazing they all have very similar

1743
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:09,889
buds and when you break them open that's

1744
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:11,989
when the nose really comes out of them

1745
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:14,480
you know and when you break them open

1746
01:15:11,988 --> 01:15:17,569
and start tearing it off it's just a

1747
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:20,750
very intoxicating nose and you know when

1748
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:22,939
Neville got the cut he took his best

1749
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:25,279
indica mail which was a Northern Lights

1750
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:26,009
number one and he read it to the Pacific

1751
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:28,408
North hash

1752
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:30,809
and release does I know how sprint on f1

1753
01:15:28,408 --> 01:15:35,939
hybrids and then he did a back cross and

1754
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:37,889
as the hash plants eats and you know

1755
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:40,828
it's really cool to be able to put the

1756
01:15:37,889 --> 01:15:44,010
Northern Lights number one mail up to

1757
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:46,788
these clones you know yeah and so I mean

1758
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:49,500
with that in mind I guess theoretically

1759
01:15:46,788 --> 01:15:51,090
cuz we should maybe stay this for anyone

1760
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:55,139
who's not on board with this idea is

1761
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:58,949
that we I strongly believe that Skelly

1762
01:15:55,139 --> 01:16:00,960
is the result of a plan from nevels

1763
01:15:58,948 --> 01:16:02,399
original of the seed bank the hash plant

1764
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,559
seed stock which is what we just said

1765
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,210
was the hash playing across to the NL

1766
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:07,949
one back cross to the hash plan again

1767
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:11,189
so with that in mind you could

1768
01:16:07,948 --> 01:16:12,988
theoretically back cross Skelly either

1769
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:14,729
way way no you couldn't you don't have a

1770
01:16:12,988 --> 01:16:15,928
male of the hash plan but you got a male

1771
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:17,939
of the northern light so you could back

1772
01:16:15,929 --> 01:16:20,760
cross at that direction and you could

1773
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:24,268
also now you have to reverse it wouldn't

1774
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:26,639
you yeah yeah some people I know

1775
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:28,829
actually a backyard farmer in South Fork

1776
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:31,319
seeds got an old hashed plant pack and

1777
01:16:28,828 --> 01:16:32,969
it was really old stark and I was just

1778
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:34,408
like please give me in mail I want to

1779
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:36,989
make a triple back cross off this

1780
01:16:34,408 --> 01:16:42,328
Pacific Northwest and they didn't get a

1781
01:16:36,988 --> 01:16:48,569
meal unfortunately KQ has a friend in

1782
01:16:42,328 --> 01:16:50,880
Washington that in 1989 um did f2s off

1783
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:54,679
Pacific Northwest hash plant seeds and

1784
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:58,409
then a few years later he did another

1785
01:16:54,679 --> 01:17:02,550
breeding took him to f3 and um he's

1786
01:16:58,408 --> 01:17:05,698
given KQ some of those seeds extremely

1787
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:07,800
excited you know possibly work with

1788
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:10,259
those males if his friend would give us

1789
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:13,949
permission you know if not I'm gonna do

1790
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:16,199
it just for preservation sake and so I

1791
01:17:13,948 --> 01:17:19,348
wonder if you would ever be able to find

1792
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:21,689
out who popped the initial you know the

1793
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:22,889
the land race hash plant seeds that you

1794
01:17:21,689 --> 01:17:24,658
know never will ended up getting the

1795
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:27,659
clone or his initial breeding I wonder

1796
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:28,229
who popped that found that that's a good

1797
01:17:27,658 --> 01:17:30,719
question

1798
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:32,518
um I was hoping you would ask bode that

1799
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:36,179
I'm gonna have to have a conversation

1800
01:17:32,519 --> 01:17:39,119
with bode about that and he'll know the

1801
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:39,809
backstory on who's been keeping the

1802
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:43,768
clonal

1803
01:17:39,809 --> 01:17:45,659
because I know archived and CSI also

1804
01:17:43,769 --> 01:17:49,319
have it I noticed art on all three of

1805
01:17:45,658 --> 01:17:51,538
those breeders list and then my new gig

1806
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:54,089
you and thought you were good friends so

1807
01:17:51,538 --> 01:17:58,918
that's who I went through to access it

1808
01:17:54,088 --> 01:18:02,099
and um yeah okay I'm sorry I didn't ask

1809
01:17:58,918 --> 01:18:05,219
but yeah you'll have the answer

1810
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:08,189
oh yeah I'll get that question answered

1811
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:09,868
synonyms yeah fantastic I'd love to know

1812
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:12,869
but what I wanted to jump back to for

1813
01:18:09,868 --> 01:18:15,058
just a moment was you mentioned in a

1814
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:16,139
story a few minutes ago that you lost a

1815
01:18:15,059 --> 01:18:18,929
plant because you couldn't get rid of

1816
01:18:16,139 --> 01:18:22,828
the p.m. off it I got a hypothetical for

1817
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:25,109
you let's say you had only one cutting

1818
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:26,818
of a strain that you really love and

1819
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:29,039
it's got that same issue it's got Pam

1820
01:18:26,819 --> 01:18:31,979
you can't get rid of it would you rather

1821
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:34,618
lose a cut then potentially have to use

1822
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:38,458
some kind of you know systemic chemical

1823
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:42,808
type thing or would you just lose it and

1824
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:47,188
kind of be happy with the memories so at

1825
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:48,809
that point around 2005 I was one of the

1826
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,878
first people I knew that could get rid

1827
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:53,639
of powdery mildew it hit California

1828
01:18:50,878 --> 01:18:56,849
pretty hard and before that no one had

1829
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:58,828
really dealt with it I have to growing a

1830
01:18:56,849 --> 01:19:01,078
will it's Hannah bolt and I moved up to

1831
01:18:58,828 --> 01:19:04,078
Trinidad in Humboldt County and we lived

1832
01:19:01,078 --> 01:19:06,148
right on the coast and I took Master

1833
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:10,768
Kush train wreck

1834
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:15,739
sour way purple a Sour Diesel

1835
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:19,769
headband Pacific Northwest [ __ ] and

1836
01:19:15,738 --> 01:19:23,728
the HP 13 clone up into that house and I

1837
01:19:19,769 --> 01:19:25,530
was getting rid of the powdery mildew by

1838
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:27,719
getting the plants and a healthy grow

1839
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:30,118
environment healthy humidity good amount

1840
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:32,399
of light healthy organic nutrients

1841
01:19:30,118 --> 01:19:34,858
growing the plants fast spraying them

1842
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:36,809
with potassium silicate and neem oil at

1843
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:38,519
the time and that's what my only method

1844
01:19:36,809 --> 01:19:41,969
of attack back then was those two

1845
01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:44,969
products and I had everything else clean

1846
01:19:41,969 --> 01:19:47,878
for several runs of clones you know and

1847
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:50,878
those two would just pop it out the

1848
01:19:47,878 --> 01:19:53,369
Pacific Northwest and the hash plant and

1849
01:19:50,878 --> 01:19:56,960
I just killed them and

1850
01:19:53,369 --> 01:19:59,909
I personally never used pesticides

1851
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,430
strictly against it a hundred percent

1852
01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:05,579
organic nowadays I'm not scared of

1853
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:09,180
anything I'm like bring it on because

1854
01:20:05,579 --> 01:20:13,109
with my organic IPM regiments I spray

1855
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:15,240
every other day with a great go on x9

1856
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:18,029
ping sprayer really hard when I'm

1857
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:20,729
cleaning up clones and I'll spray every

1858
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:23,069
other day with micronized sulfur for a

1859
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:25,799
month and then I'll switch to potassium

1860
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:27,659
silicon neem oil and essential oils and

1861
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,130
I'll spray every other day for a month

1862
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:33,149
of that and then I'll put them through

1863
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:35,010
like a week of green clean there's

1864
01:20:33,149 --> 01:20:37,289
another product I'll use to just kill

1865
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:39,810
the [ __ ] out of bugs and systemic and

1866
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:41,519
powdery mildew diseases and I feel like

1867
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:43,140
if you get enough of those products in

1868
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:46,290
the plant and they're in a healthy girl

1869
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:49,230
environment growing fast that you can

1870
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:52,260
get rid of anything and so here's the

1871
01:20:49,229 --> 01:20:56,699
moon dollar question do you have to

1872
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:59,190
abandon crop if you get some kind of bug

1873
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:01,920
infestation you know maybe rude aphids

1874
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:03,500
maybe mites if you're in flower because

1875
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,670
that seems to be the big one I have

1876
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,109
issues discussing with people like

1877
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,760
people say to me you know like i'm kind

1878
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:09,960
of converting to organics and they're

1879
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,300
like what do i do if i get into in

1880
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,069
flower and it's kind of like you just

1881
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,600
kind of avoid that and they're like so

1882
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:17,279
there's really nothing you can do and

1883
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,220
it's like we yeah you can't really spray

1884
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:22,079
the IPM stuff in flower so what's your

1885
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:24,900
what do you say like you just prevention

1886
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:28,229
is the best answer so you know i've been

1887
01:21:24,899 --> 01:21:30,869
gone since the early 90s and then i just

1888
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:32,849
told you how serious my IPM methods are

1889
01:21:30,869 --> 01:21:35,369
to clean up clones and that's what I do

1890
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:37,590
before I decide to flower something I

1891
01:21:35,369 --> 01:21:39,869
put them through literally two and a

1892
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:42,020
half months of every other day spraying

1893
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:46,140
literally a micronized sulfur will kill

1894
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:48,720
micro my spider mites any fungal disease

1895
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:51,810
and then soil essential oils neem oil

1896
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:53,960
and potassium silicate so I feel like

1897
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:56,730
you get in all those products in there

1898
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:58,800
you're not gonna have problems I've been

1899
01:21:56,729 --> 01:22:00,979
growing forever of course I've had runs

1900
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:05,010
that got [ __ ] up by spider mites or

1901
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:06,899
powdery mildew but I grow number one

1902
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:09,869
reason is for my personal headstand

1903
01:22:06,899 --> 01:22:13,649
and I want really good strong clean meds

1904
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:16,800
and I'm dedicated and that's the reason

1905
01:22:13,649 --> 01:22:18,719
I developed that two and a half month of

1906
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,420
cleaning up clones before I bring them

1907
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:23,640
into my flour room and that also gives

1908
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:27,000
some really healthy so that I'm gonna

1909
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:29,190
see their true genetic potential and now

1910
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,260
you know not contaminate the rest of the

1911
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:32,279
collection you know and then I'll put

1912
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,500
the whole collection through that

1913
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:41,429
treatment once a year just in case you

1914
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:43,829
know yep sure so on the issue of p.m.

1915
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:46,020
I've heard that some people say once a

1916
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:47,609
clones got it it's got it forever you

1917
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:49,410
know and the idea of it being systemic

1918
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:51,569
kind of hints to that but at the same

1919
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:53,489
time never found hard evidence do you

1920
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:55,799
believe that you can get rid of it or

1921
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:57,329
you're just kind of beating it down to

1922
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:02,190
the point where it's not likely to

1923
01:22:57,329 --> 01:23:05,250
manifest out I believe a hundred percent

1924
01:23:02,189 --> 01:23:07,289
that you can outrun it when I mentioned

1925
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:11,359
Hannibal and I moved to Trinidad and

1926
01:23:07,289 --> 01:23:15,149
those that Pacific Northwest [ __ ] and

1927
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:18,779
HP 13 kept persisting we when we called

1928
01:23:15,149 --> 01:23:21,420
those I didn't spray [ __ ] and we had no

1929
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:23,099
PM for eight years and I believe it was

1930
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:27,210
through getting the plants in a healthy

1931
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:28,980
environment growing fast and then taking

1932
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,840
cuttings off the top of the plant while

1933
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:33,149
you were hitting the plant at the same

1934
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:37,020
time with potassium silicon and NEMA

1935
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:38,939
loss and both of those are fungicides in

1936
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,620
their own right and you know it might be

1937
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:42,539
in the stump but you know I took my

1938
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:44,039
stumps at that point took the top of the

1939
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:45,449
cuttings and I [ __ ] got the red of

1940
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:48,390
the stumps you know and just kept the

1941
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:51,389
tops and I believe a hundred percent

1942
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:53,600
that you can get rid of powder powdery

1943
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:56,160
mildew that way especially if you use a

1944
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:58,800
micronized sulfur which I didn't know

1945
01:23:56,159 --> 01:24:00,510
about back then that's even a tougher

1946
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,409
plan on the PM it's nothing I'd want to

1947
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:06,210
use for something I'd want to smoke but

1948
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:10,409
we're talking about cleaning up all

1949
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:13,159
genetics here so they're not lost okay

1950
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:16,889
and are you also of the opinion that

1951
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:19,109
sulfur is one of the more overlooked

1952
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:20,639
elements in when people are kind of

1953
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:23,759
building their soil

1954
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:28,378
hundred percent it helps to bring out

1955
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:30,869
Terps on I believe yeah fantastic and so

1956
01:24:28,378 --> 01:24:32,819
if we look at the discussion of jeddak

1957
01:24:30,868 --> 01:24:34,139
genetics sorry if we look at the

1958
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:37,198
discussion of genetics throughout

1959
01:24:34,139 --> 01:24:39,538
history people often say our genetics

1960
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:40,558
used to be really good do you think that

1961
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:43,559
what they're actually trying to maybe

1962
01:24:40,559 --> 01:24:45,538
say is that they used to be more variety

1963
01:24:43,559 --> 01:24:49,889
or do you think genetics in the past

1964
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:52,529
were better like on average I think on

1965
01:24:49,889 --> 01:24:55,800
average [ __ ] necks are much better

1966
01:24:52,529 --> 01:24:58,889
today I just think our genetic diversity

1967
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,929
has somewhat been lost especially with

1968
01:24:58,889 --> 01:25:02,819
the sativas that are very difficult to

1969
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:05,219
grow you grow them for twice the amount

1970
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:07,168
of time and you get these small spindly

1971
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:09,118
buds that you know it's not really what

1972
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:11,908
the market wants now and some people

1973
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:13,799
that's their cup of tea those soaring

1974
01:25:11,908 --> 01:25:16,198
psychedelic eyes and there's not many

1975
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:18,479
commercial growers that'll provide that

1976
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:22,228
form you know and there's not very many

1977
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:24,869
places that people can go and buy those

1978
01:25:22,229 --> 01:25:28,499
types of seeds you know unless it's you

1979
01:25:24,868 --> 01:25:30,688
know a czar trainer across so how do you

1980
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:32,668
tackle that issue of having you know

1981
01:25:30,689 --> 01:25:34,739
really long flowering strains let's just

1982
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:38,368
say you know an extremely sample your

1983
01:25:34,738 --> 01:25:39,779
flowering 16-week strain so you know

1984
01:25:38,368 --> 01:25:41,668
let's just say 14 you know no one's

1985
01:25:39,779 --> 01:25:43,679
early flowering 16 weeks rains 14 week

1986
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:45,929
strain you know not that unheard of but

1987
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,998
um you know you should you be charging

1988
01:25:45,929 --> 01:25:49,378
like you know close to twice as much as

1989
01:25:47,998 --> 01:25:51,448
like a seven or eight weeks train like

1990
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:53,578
how how do you compensate that in the

1991
01:25:51,448 --> 01:25:55,228
business model when I guess you know a

1992
01:25:53,578 --> 01:25:57,569
lot of people are probably not going to

1993
01:25:55,229 --> 01:25:59,579
expect maybe they'll have except a bit

1994
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:01,198
of a price increase but maybe if you

1995
01:25:59,578 --> 01:26:03,389
look at the flower time proportionately

1996
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:05,668
they they won't budge in that and that

1997
01:26:03,389 --> 01:26:07,288
was the driving force that got us to

1998
01:26:05,668 --> 01:26:10,349
this spot wasn't it like you know how do

1999
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:12,478
you think we tackle that issue you know

2000
01:26:10,349 --> 01:26:14,128
unfortunately on what I see is people

2001
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,469
that are complaining that there's no

2002
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:18,269
city bus but then when the city bizarre

2003
01:26:16,469 --> 01:26:20,248
available they're not willing to pay

2004
01:26:18,269 --> 01:26:22,949
anymore form in the city was actually

2005
01:26:20,248 --> 01:26:25,648
good overlooked pretty much it's fear

2006
01:26:22,948 --> 01:26:27,748
sativa lover I recommend you get some

2007
01:26:25,649 --> 01:26:30,659
good sativa genetics and growing

2008
01:26:27,748 --> 01:26:32,188
yourself in a greenhouse because you

2009
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:32,929
know that's where sativa is really shine

2010
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:36,260
in my opinion

2011
01:26:32,929 --> 01:26:38,689
and so if we look at the photos on your

2012
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:40,579
Instagram a lot of them are from green

2013
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:42,650
houses in fact you probably struggle to

2014
01:26:40,578 --> 01:26:44,299
kind of find one in an indoor setting do

2015
01:26:42,649 --> 01:26:48,649
you do indoors at all or are you all

2016
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:52,010
outdoors no I love indoor growing I keep

2017
01:26:48,649 --> 01:26:54,498
a lot of my mom's indoors currently I am

2018
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:56,900
excited actually to be moving them to my

2019
01:26:54,498 --> 01:27:00,349
own facility with just me and Hannibal

2020
01:26:56,899 --> 01:27:03,018
in Salinas going for the legal permit

2021
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:06,139
down there on 10,000 square feet so that

2022
01:27:03,019 --> 01:27:09,860
we can keep the quality up but uh you

2023
01:27:06,139 --> 01:27:12,050
know I love to work outside you know and

2024
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:14,448
if I had an opportunity to work in a

2025
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:16,729
greenhouse versus an indoor warehouse

2026
01:27:14,448 --> 01:27:18,589
I'm going to take the greenhouse any day

2027
01:27:16,729 --> 01:27:21,050
of the week um I love being outside I

2028
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:22,939
love being with nature fresh air well

2029
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:26,059
not under the artificial lights being

2030
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:28,880
under the sunlight and I'm really really

2031
01:27:26,059 --> 01:27:30,619
working hard to bring the quality of my

2032
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,569
greenhouse up to the quality of my

2033
01:27:30,618 --> 01:27:35,058
indoor and you know that's a fun

2034
01:27:32,569 --> 01:27:36,639
challenge for me yeah that's an

2035
01:27:35,059 --> 01:27:39,969
interesting one in my opinion because

2036
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:42,618
often I find people you know they'll say

2037
01:27:39,969 --> 01:27:44,389
outdoor is the best it's unbeatable and

2038
01:27:42,618 --> 01:27:46,908
it's like I think what they really

2039
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:50,029
trying to say is like theoretically it

2040
01:27:46,908 --> 01:27:52,670
can do better than indoor but rarely do

2041
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:54,679
I find personally outdoor that is better

2042
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:56,389
than indoor at least my indoor how do

2043
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:58,189
you feel about that you know you have

2044
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:59,958
the same opinion that like outdoor is

2045
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:01,699
the best or you like you know in the

2046
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:04,550
sense of that mindset of like

2047
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:05,988
theoretically or do you literally

2048
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:10,219
believe that or do you believe the

2049
01:28:05,988 --> 01:28:12,169
opposite man I just like to be honest

2050
01:28:10,219 --> 01:28:14,389
with myself and you know my favorite

2051
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:16,399
strains are indicus and when I turn them

2052
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:18,618
out inside they're [ __ ] amazing and

2053
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:21,109
I'm getting close to that quality I feel

2054
01:28:18,618 --> 01:28:22,639
like in the greenhouse now and I feel

2055
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:24,828
like greenhouse quality's definitely

2056
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:27,199
better than full Sun I really love

2057
01:28:24,828 --> 01:28:29,238
smoking full Sun Organic weed though

2058
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:31,308
that being said you know if there's

2059
01:28:29,238 --> 01:28:34,069
something about Nam especially if it's

2060
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:36,349
growing in the ground you know and they

2061
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:39,319
can get some of the native soil and

2062
01:28:36,349 --> 01:28:42,469
flavors in the full season just the

2063
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:43,908
whole experience this is really good but

2064
01:28:42,469 --> 01:28:44,369
you know if you're talking about corona

2065
01:28:43,908 --> 01:28:46,589
and all

2066
01:28:44,369 --> 01:28:47,970
clone like when my black Dominus or one

2067
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:52,800
of my chem dogs or one of those although

2068
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:55,530
jeez endure and a stable humidity and a

2069
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,570
stable temperature on those old client

2070
01:28:55,529 --> 01:28:59,219
clones shine better what they just like

2071
01:28:57,569 --> 01:29:00,840
the stable environment I don't think it

2072
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:03,270
has to do with the lights I think it's

2073
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,550
more about the stable humidity stable

2074
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:08,670
temperature okay

2075
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:11,159
and so you know often you'll find that

2076
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:13,199
plants will grow slightly different

2077
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:15,630
phenotypically slightly different taste

2078
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:18,720
wise and potency wise when you compare

2079
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:21,449
the needles outdoors do you find that

2080
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:23,880
there are some strains that you know

2081
01:29:21,449 --> 01:29:24,869
have one taste indoors and when it's

2082
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,760
outdoors it's like it's quite a

2083
01:29:24,869 --> 01:29:28,649
pronounced difference in flavor like

2084
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,780
what strain to you has the the biggest

2085
01:29:28,649 --> 01:29:32,519
just natural variation when you

2086
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:38,039
transition it from indoors to say

2087
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:40,650
greenhouse well you know the chem talked

2088
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:43,439
is one of the flavors that you can

2089
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:45,359
really hit or miss and I really enjoyed

2090
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:48,629
the full season Sun grown I did last

2091
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:50,909
year it was really a cool you get a lot

2092
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:53,579
of strains out in the Sun and they're

2093
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:57,869
just gonna have thicker stems and really

2094
01:29:53,579 --> 01:30:00,000
shine but the best stuff outside if you

2095
01:29:57,869 --> 01:30:02,159
can get it in a greenhouse is the sativa

2096
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,689
that's you know they just shine outside

2097
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:05,729
under the Sun they don't like being

2098
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:07,439
close to the lamps they grow all tall

2099
01:30:05,729 --> 01:30:09,269
you know and then getting close to that

2100
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:11,399
warm lamp that they don't seem to like

2101
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:13,230
it um you can get on a greenhouse and

2102
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:14,939
just get them under the natural Sun they

2103
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:17,429
just that's the one of the strings like

2104
01:30:14,939 --> 01:30:21,899
that does turn out better outside than

2105
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:26,100
it does inside for me are sativas and so

2106
01:30:21,899 --> 01:30:27,569
what's your favorite landrace sativa to

2107
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,060
be honest with you I really like this

2108
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:32,340
Panama red stuff it's it's good I've

2109
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:37,140
been smoking that the crap out of the

2110
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:39,659
THC vina THC V FINA on we haven't got

2111
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:43,020
the percentage tested but I've been

2112
01:30:39,659 --> 01:30:44,399
smoking that a lot and to be honest with

2113
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:48,810
you I haven't worked with too many

2114
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:52,710
landrace sativa lines cakier that's his

2115
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:54,570
specialty and like I said I'm a neuticle

2116
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:56,730
still see it's and then I went for the

2117
01:30:54,569 --> 01:30:57,599
old Afghani lines that I knew as a kid

2118
01:30:56,729 --> 01:31:01,439
first

2119
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:04,409
and you know it's I have some cool old

2120
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:08,969
cuts you know that I like one of my

2121
01:31:04,408 --> 01:31:12,118
favorite says the monkey Paul's it's the

2122
01:31:08,969 --> 01:31:13,439
enemy's soldier brought back Vietnamese

2123
01:31:12,118 --> 01:31:16,319
black and he crossed it with the

2124
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:19,888
Nepalese Highland sativa up in Michigan

2125
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:23,698
and that's a real Oakland that for like

2126
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:27,328
a twelve to fourteen link sativa really

2127
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:30,509
has a lot of earthy um cush flavors in

2128
01:31:27,328 --> 01:31:32,880
it um and they're really kind of

2129
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:36,500
grounding not so paranoid of a high for

2130
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:41,429
a sativa and that's one of my favorites

2131
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:45,539
the Pacific Northwest [ __ ] is another

2132
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:47,190
one of my favorite old sativa cuts yeah

2133
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:49,198
I mean that's a planet we've never

2134
01:31:47,189 --> 01:31:50,638
really spoke of on the show but I think

2135
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:53,819
I've read online of there's like a few

2136
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:56,010
that [ __ ] cuts the car around what do

2137
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:57,149
you think about that do you have you had

2138
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:59,639
anything along those lines or do you

2139
01:31:57,149 --> 01:32:02,578
think like no it's just um one of those

2140
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:04,139
cuts with is a few there's other plants

2141
01:32:02,578 --> 01:32:05,630
that have similar characteristics but

2142
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:08,489
like you know this fights essentially

2143
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:11,310
well there's a humble [ __ ] which is

2144
01:32:08,488 --> 01:32:14,250
different from Oregon Pacific Northwest

2145
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:15,780
[ __ ] and if you go to any of these

2146
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:18,420
clubs or dispensaries in California

2147
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:20,969
they're gonna have clones of everything

2148
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:23,130
on the menu and ninety-nine out of a

2149
01:32:20,969 --> 01:32:26,279
hundred times they're gonna be fake so

2150
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:28,289
it's pretty much you want your dog [ __ ]

2151
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:30,658
cut to come from a certain crow in

2152
01:32:28,289 --> 01:32:32,399
Oregon you know because that's where you

2153
01:32:30,658 --> 01:32:35,309
know what's the real one and that's what

2154
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:36,839
I'm big on my clones its provenance I

2155
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:39,800
really try to get them through the right

2156
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:43,469
people so you know it's the right clone

2157
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:46,050
yeah okay and so in general when you're

2158
01:32:43,469 --> 01:32:48,630
looking to do a breeding project do you

2159
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:51,599
approach it in more of like a calculated

2160
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:53,730
method in that you kind of thinking what

2161
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:55,440
is gonna pair really specifically well

2162
01:32:53,729 --> 01:32:58,439
with a certain strategy or are you more

2163
01:32:55,439 --> 01:33:00,359
so just like I like this one male let's

2164
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:05,069
hit everything with it and then see if

2165
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:08,519
any of them particularly work well no

2166
01:33:05,069 --> 01:33:10,500
I've kind of been doing kind of like in

2167
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,210
cross work work

2168
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:15,239
send these lines back into something

2169
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:17,850
that I think's in them you know or

2170
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:20,010
definitely confirm to end the string you

2171
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:23,280
know to kind of stabilize it and bring

2172
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:25,590
it back to a pure form so that other

2173
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:28,500
breeders and friends can get these

2174
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:30,150
strains and back cross them further or

2175
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:32,670
take a little work lines with them I

2176
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:35,849
really want to provide old-school

2177
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:38,850
genetics and stuff this ready for people

2178
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:42,329
to breed with do you foresee a time

2179
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:44,820
where your breeding methods would have

2180
01:33:42,329 --> 01:33:47,430
to change by virtue of just you know

2181
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:49,049
there's new let's just say we fast

2182
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:51,360
forward 10 years from now and coastal

2183
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:53,820
seeds it's got an awesome menu with most

2184
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,229
landrace strains on it work to a point

2185
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:57,389
where you're happy to have it publicly

2186
01:33:55,229 --> 01:34:01,289
available do you think you would then

2187
01:33:57,390 --> 01:34:02,940
look at say doing some f1 hybrids with

2188
01:34:01,289 --> 01:34:05,550
land race strands kind of similar to how

2189
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:07,139
bode does or what would what would you

2190
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:09,300
look to do at that point if you know you

2191
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:11,490
had to kind of if you were forced to

2192
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:15,329
evolve out of just doing preservation

2193
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:18,599
work well I'm gonna spend 50% of my time

2194
01:34:15,329 --> 01:34:20,369
pretty much doing the preservation pure

2195
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:24,300
lines and then I'm gonna spend the other

2196
01:34:20,369 --> 01:34:28,920
50% concentrating on these NL outlines

2197
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:31,860
with the hash plant and m10 and working

2198
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:34,020
those ok and do you have an end goal

2199
01:34:31,859 --> 01:34:36,059
foreseeable with those or you just kind

2200
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:39,420
of see where it takes you I want to

2201
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:41,250
remake that a old kill stream from North

2202
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:44,550
Carolina that I used to cut that's the

2203
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:47,510
best weed I've ever smelled the rapture

2204
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:50,909
the kill and sorry you said that was a

2205
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:55,770
g13 cross and no hash plant a no hash

2206
01:34:50,909 --> 01:34:59,010
plant MLG 13 yes old-school Amsterdam

2207
01:34:55,770 --> 01:35:02,660
stock so how you gonna fill that any OG

2208
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:06,869
13 spot luckily I just got that airborne

2209
01:35:02,659 --> 01:35:09,149
g13 okay and you think it oh it was

2210
01:35:06,869 --> 01:35:11,369
maybe the airborne used originally or

2211
01:35:09,149 --> 01:35:14,099
you like because I guess I'm thinking is

2212
01:35:11,369 --> 01:35:16,710
there everyone g13 in my eyes is not

2213
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:20,340
like pg-13 you know it's like it's a

2214
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:23,970
cross it's the closest I can get and

2215
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:26,610
it's actually uh I think it's she

2216
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:31,140
thirteen Biennal - so it's actually half

2217
01:35:26,609 --> 01:35:33,899
the work done for me yeah okay and so do

2218
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:35,070
you think the real original g13 is still

2219
01:35:33,899 --> 01:35:36,750
out there or are you just saying like

2220
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:39,049
now we haven't heard about it for so

2221
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:42,449
long it's it's most likely gone

2222
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:44,010
you know I like to think that anything

2223
01:35:42,449 --> 01:35:45,420
could be out there you know a lot of

2224
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:48,239
people that put in work

2225
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:50,250
don't come online I just came online up

2226
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:52,289
with my Instagram account a few years

2227
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:55,529
ago you know and I had tons of strands

2228
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:56,819
that people really didn't have and you

2229
01:35:55,529 --> 01:36:00,479
know I've really shared them a lot you

2230
01:35:56,819 --> 01:36:02,579
know yeah okay so you never know who's

2231
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:04,769
gonna come out and burn a blast from the

2232
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:08,449
past and a lot of time when these

2233
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:11,130
classics come up they want cookies or

2234
01:36:08,449 --> 01:36:13,739
skittles or something like that for

2235
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:19,739
these old classic gems and I'm happy to

2236
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:21,989
balázs so what is the most type in rich

2237
01:36:19,739 --> 01:36:24,059
plant you've ever had or grown yourself

2238
01:36:21,989 --> 01:36:28,550
as a bit of a just totally different

2239
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:32,310
question wow there's so many of them

2240
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:34,320
unfortunately a lot of time when you get

2241
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:37,020
super high amount of Europeans in this

2242
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:40,739
string you don't really get potency and

2243
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:43,230
that's a rare combination you know this

2244
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:46,319
lemon tree out of santa cruz that's one

2245
01:36:43,229 --> 01:36:49,699
of the few strains that really combines

2246
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:52,259
the two together it's an amazing cut

2247
01:36:49,699 --> 01:36:54,599
yeah do you know the history behind the

2248
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:57,300
lemon tree it seems to have gotten a

2249
01:36:54,600 --> 01:37:00,210
popularity really quickly I mean I think

2250
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:02,190
people may have seen it swamp boys breed

2251
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:03,239
with an S one of it as a mother so

2252
01:37:02,189 --> 01:37:08,489
that's even a bit of an interesting

2253
01:37:03,239 --> 01:37:11,399
thing in itself yeah I have to cut

2254
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:14,760
through Santa Cruz and his literally uh

2255
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:17,729
since I harvested it it's like this top

2256
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:21,480
ten top maybe top five in the collection

2257
01:37:17,729 --> 01:37:26,099
I've heard it's you know maybe an old

2258
01:37:21,479 --> 01:37:31,049
string called Lemon Drop or a lemon tie

2259
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:33,720
cross it's a very short compact indica

2260
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:36,630
growing plant with a very lemon strong

2261
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:37,780
flavor and in narcotic I so very strong

2262
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:39,909
and

2263
01:37:37,779 --> 01:37:41,859
you think this isn't a new hybrid but

2264
01:37:39,909 --> 01:37:43,389
just something that's been unknown for a

2265
01:37:41,859 --> 01:37:45,279
long time and like do you kind of know

2266
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:48,130
anymore of the genetics besides that

2267
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:50,590
potentially that it's the lemon drop you

2268
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:52,869
know that's all I know

2269
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:55,420
you know that's pretty much it the rest

2270
01:37:52,869 --> 01:37:57,849
would just be me taking somebody that's

2271
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:59,770
something else you know yeah might not

2272
01:37:57,850 --> 01:38:02,020
be true and I don't want to lead anyone

2273
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:04,300
in the wrong direction but I'm pretty

2274
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:07,210
sure that's kind of like what the guys

2275
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:09,340
are saying yeah so I mean on the other

2276
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:12,520
spectrum of instead of being a

2277
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:13,810
hypochondriac the most underrated car

2278
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:21,070
you know the one that doesn't get enough

2279
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:23,920
credit for what it is you know I think

2280
01:38:21,069 --> 01:38:25,989
I'm dog decent on the best weed and you

2281
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,640
know I don't have that many people that

2282
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:31,239
agree with me unless I smoke it with

2283
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:35,530
them on the black dominance are really

2284
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:39,309
good the super skully the podcast plant

2285
01:38:35,529 --> 01:38:41,500
when done proper is really really good

2286
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:45,880
red Lebanese house plant

2287
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:48,100
I have is an amazing cut the athe 13

2288
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:51,369
hash plant those are all some of the

2289
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:52,660
most kind of underrated I guess 8hd 13

2290
01:38:51,369 --> 01:38:56,409
hash plants been getting a lot of

2291
01:38:52,659 --> 01:39:00,519
respect because Bodie used it and you

2292
01:38:56,409 --> 01:39:02,619
know yeah okay so just while we're on

2293
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:04,600
the topic I guess you kind of already

2294
01:39:02,619 --> 01:39:06,130
answered it overall you just said you

2295
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,950
prefer the chem date but do you think

2296
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:10,659
the 91 is more potent than the day or no

2297
01:39:08,949 --> 01:39:11,229
the d actually takes the potency for you

2298
01:39:10,659 --> 01:39:15,059
as well

2299
01:39:11,229 --> 01:39:18,669
potency 100% when done right I think

2300
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:20,860
they're both very picky but you know I

2301
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:23,500
think they're equally picky people say

2302
01:39:20,859 --> 01:39:27,849
that ninety once pickier but I think the

2303
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:33,369
T is very picky too and it's mine and

2304
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:35,980
Hannibal favored weed okay and so what's

2305
01:39:33,369 --> 01:39:42,039
the one cut you most wish you could get

2306
01:39:35,979 --> 01:39:44,219
your hands on HP 13 and are you

2307
01:39:42,039 --> 01:39:47,649
confident it's still around

2308
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:49,570
yeah either through the island crew or

2309
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:51,549
the New York career um I could probably

2310
01:39:49,569 --> 01:39:56,198
get it it's just you know that's obvious

2311
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:57,789
a lot of work okay and so I found an

2312
01:39:56,198 --> 01:40:00,158
interesting photo on your Instagram feed

2313
01:39:57,789 --> 01:40:02,050
you know it's I'm pretty sure it's like

2314
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:04,149
a compost tea from what you said in the

2315
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:07,029
description but honestly it looks like

2316
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:08,888
soil with these crazy mycelium hi-5

2317
01:40:07,029 --> 01:40:10,448
forming all through it kind of looks

2318
01:40:08,889 --> 01:40:13,029
like you know iconic the way Bokashi

2319
01:40:10,448 --> 01:40:15,250
does to your topsoil what's your recipe

2320
01:40:13,029 --> 01:40:17,380
for an awesome tea like that because

2321
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:22,569
that was like the most photogenic

2322
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:24,190
looking tea I've ever seen yeah so one

2323
01:40:22,569 --> 01:40:27,099
of the key ingredients for me to get

2324
01:40:24,189 --> 01:40:28,988
that messy Liam that's thick literally a

2325
01:40:27,099 --> 01:40:33,099
stop fungus gnats dead in their tracks

2326
01:40:28,988 --> 01:40:35,218
though it'll kill them is grow Kashi and

2327
01:40:33,099 --> 01:40:39,340
then you know you mix that with some

2328
01:40:35,219 --> 01:40:42,760
dragonfly Earth medicine brilliant black

2329
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:45,880
and then some really high quality

2330
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:47,920
compost and are thrown castings it's

2331
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:50,920
really you know really I can't emphasize

2332
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,989
you know how important it is to get high

2333
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:55,929
quality of those two products and also

2334
01:40:52,988 --> 01:40:58,348
to get several sources of high quality

2335
01:40:55,929 --> 01:41:01,328
compost several sources of high-quality

2336
01:40:58,349 --> 01:41:04,690
are thrown castings for the biodiversity

2337
01:41:01,328 --> 01:41:06,488
the keys are the grow Kashi and the

2338
01:41:04,689 --> 01:41:10,000
brilliant black that just get it looking

2339
01:41:06,488 --> 01:41:11,649
like a carpet and so in general how

2340
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,479
would you describe your gross style you

2341
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:15,969
like you know you kind of run like a

2342
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:19,388
no-till type of system or more of like a

2343
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:24,520
super soil type of thing or liquid how

2344
01:41:19,389 --> 01:41:28,659
would you describe yourself I I would

2345
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:31,510
describe my style as I do a lot of top

2346
01:41:28,658 --> 01:41:33,519
dressing I do a lot of fresh extractions

2347
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:35,020
of earthworm castings and compost I

2348
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:37,290
don't throw them all just extract them

2349
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:40,840
into the water and water immediately

2350
01:41:37,289 --> 01:41:43,448
lots of for you live feeds as we go in

2351
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:45,610
to the first beginning of flour and

2352
01:41:43,448 --> 01:41:47,738
through veg not to really make sure it

2353
01:41:45,609 --> 01:41:50,109
has everything it needs and the right

2354
01:41:47,738 --> 01:41:55,689
parts of the plant and top of the plant

2355
01:41:50,109 --> 01:41:57,488
and then you know I just kind of you

2356
01:41:55,689 --> 01:41:59,919
know it sounds a little hokey pokey but

2357
01:41:57,488 --> 01:42:02,229
I keep you know just can look at the

2358
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:03,819
plants and you know I get high and I

2359
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:05,329
spend time around them and I can just

2360
01:42:03,819 --> 01:42:08,210
read read the plants

2361
01:42:05,329 --> 01:42:09,470
what they're lacking and how happy they

2362
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:12,289
are about how they're holding their

2363
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:14,630
leaves and how their growth is and I

2364
01:42:12,289 --> 01:42:17,300
really feel like if you can hang out and

2365
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:20,210
your grow room for a certain period of

2366
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:22,789
time look at your plants kind of vibe

2367
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:24,649
off of them leave for a little bit go

2368
01:42:22,789 --> 01:42:26,359
take a bunch of bong hits or you know

2369
01:42:24,649 --> 01:42:28,609
smoke a joint whatever you like to do

2370
01:42:26,359 --> 01:42:30,949
and then go back in and just read and

2371
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:32,809
vibe you do that a couple times a day

2372
01:42:30,949 --> 01:42:34,699
for a long period of time you're really

2373
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:37,250
going to be able to just walk into a

2374
01:42:34,699 --> 01:42:39,649
grown and and look at plants and be like

2375
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:41,119
that's that strain on death strain is

2376
01:42:39,649 --> 01:42:43,699
unhappy because of the way it's holding

2377
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:47,329
its leaves I could see you know

2378
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:50,359
different strains by you know at their

2379
01:42:47,329 --> 01:42:52,369
Leafs and just how happy they are and

2380
01:42:50,359 --> 01:42:54,519
you know you really you know it just

2381
01:42:52,369 --> 01:42:57,710
comes with spending time with the plants

2382
01:42:54,520 --> 01:43:01,130
and so what do you think is the kind of

2383
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:03,289
upper ceiling of what one person can

2384
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:05,150
tend to in terms of plant numbers and

2385
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:06,199
giving them adequate care because I

2386
01:43:05,149 --> 01:43:08,359
think a lot of people are worried about

2387
01:43:06,199 --> 01:43:10,309
the idea of big companies coming along

2388
01:43:08,359 --> 01:43:12,710
and you know like the idea of like a

2389
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:14,420
grower having to tend to like 10,000

2390
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:15,439
plants in a day and it's like it's like

2391
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:17,239
surely you're spreading yourself too

2392
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:19,099
thin at that point of the plant can't be

2393
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:22,369
getting enough attention what for you is

2394
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:24,980
do you think the upper limit yeah well

2395
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:27,229
you know I grew nine acres for a hemp

2396
01:43:24,979 --> 01:43:28,549
company in Colorado and by the time we

2397
01:43:27,229 --> 01:43:30,589
got it back around to the other side of

2398
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:34,430
the field the water um they were about

2399
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:36,800
to die of water and you know that wasn't

2400
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:39,619
a fun experience and since then I've

2401
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:41,510
turned down a couple job offers to be

2402
01:43:39,619 --> 01:43:44,349
you know I had gross four large

2403
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:46,730
operations and Hannibal and I decided to

2404
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:50,360
you know go forward and put the whole

2405
01:43:46,729 --> 01:43:53,599
life savings and to go get permitted in

2406
01:43:50,359 --> 01:43:56,479
Monterey County in Salinas and get a ten

2407
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,220
thousand square foot apartment and you

2408
01:43:56,479 --> 01:43:59,869
know that'll be cool because I'll be

2409
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:03,140
able to have the collection in their

2410
01:43:59,869 --> 01:44:03,849
safe kind of greenhouse and yeah for

2411
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:08,300
sure

2412
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:09,380
and so a question I wanted to ask you

2413
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:10,699
because I think you might be able to

2414
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:12,770
give an interesting perspective on it

2415
01:44:10,699 --> 01:44:14,029
I've done some research on the history

2416
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:15,530
of Northern Lights and I'm sure you are

2417
01:44:14,029 --> 01:44:17,130
pretty well-versed in it given the

2418
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:21,210
projects you're doing

2419
01:44:17,130 --> 01:44:22,739
I have a feeling that the guy who first

2420
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:25,829
gave Neville with the Northern Lights

2421
01:44:22,739 --> 01:44:28,679
you know the Indian Joe I have a feeling

2422
01:44:25,829 --> 01:44:32,670
that's Romulan Joe what do you think

2423
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:33,930
about that so for a long time growing up

2424
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:36,690
I had heard that they were the same

2425
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:40,829
person recently when I started the

2426
01:44:36,689 --> 01:44:43,799
project we did a lot of Investigation KQ

2427
01:44:40,829 --> 01:44:46,609
calling up all friends me doing any

2428
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:49,350
research Bollywood B I'm doing um

2429
01:44:46,609 --> 01:44:52,109
computer research and Bollywood vamped

2430
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:54,200
on this High Times article where it said

2431
01:44:52,109 --> 01:44:59,909
they were the same person

2432
01:44:54,199 --> 01:45:03,090
kqs research led to the fact that they

2433
01:44:59,909 --> 01:45:05,550
are definitely different people from

2434
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:08,340
what I believe in what he told me I

2435
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:10,500
think some of the original Northern

2436
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:13,140
Lights guys are on Facebook I'm not on

2437
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:15,600
Facebook myself I'm from what he told me

2438
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:17,369
some guy named Harvey is the guy that

2439
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,430
brought him back from Afghanistan and

2440
01:45:17,369 --> 01:45:23,189
gave him to Seattle Greg Seattle Greg

2441
01:45:20,430 --> 01:45:27,079
worked with to Jos on one home was

2442
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:30,989
Indian Joe that's to kick Hugh's friend

2443
01:45:27,079 --> 01:45:33,329
classic see it's met up in Oregon and

2444
01:45:30,989 --> 01:45:37,170
that's where he got the NL number-one

2445
01:45:33,329 --> 01:45:39,899
stock so I think Seattle Greg is in

2446
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:41,789
islands and that would be one hell of an

2447
01:45:39,899 --> 01:45:46,049
interview if you could get him to talk

2448
01:45:41,789 --> 01:45:48,029
Oh interesting and so you think is with

2449
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:50,159
people like this where that old stock

2450
01:45:48,029 --> 01:45:51,960
resides not just necessarily for

2451
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:56,309
Northern Lights but for everything type

2452
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:59,279
thing you know if they still have some

2453
01:45:56,310 --> 01:46:02,490
northern likes you know if that would be

2454
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:04,559
very cool we're not supposed to release

2455
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:06,449
the Northern Lights Pier ourselves so

2456
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,730
we're only supposed to release hybrids

2457
01:46:06,449 --> 01:46:10,979
and why do you think they wouldn't want

2458
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:13,229
to come forward and get credit for what

2459
01:46:10,979 --> 01:46:17,339
is easily you know the poster child of

2460
01:46:13,229 --> 01:46:19,319
all cannabis I think um from what I've

2461
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:21,569
heard maybe he hasn't been approached by

2462
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:23,609
somebody like you I think if he's

2463
01:46:21,569 --> 01:46:24,130
admitted on Facebook why wouldn't he

2464
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:26,500
want to

2465
01:46:24,130 --> 01:46:31,319
on a bigger show and get further into it

2466
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:33,729
mmm okay we have to follow that up so

2467
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:36,639
I've been digging around on Instagram

2468
01:46:33,729 --> 01:46:39,488
for a bit and I found a post which says

2469
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:42,520
that you have a legendary back story

2470
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:44,349
behind the red Lebanese hash plant um

2471
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:46,540
and you think it could be closely

2472
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:50,320
related to the g13 you know what is that

2473
01:46:46,539 --> 01:46:52,899
story well from my understanding Howard

2474
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:55,569
Marks the smuggler gave nevels two

2475
01:46:52,899 --> 01:47:00,488
favorite strengths the red Lebanese hash

2476
01:46:55,569 --> 01:47:02,649
plant and g13 from America and Howard

2477
01:47:00,488 --> 01:47:05,709
Marks is also known as mr. nice he's

2478
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:07,869
since passed away rest in peace and he

2479
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:09,760
also you know he obviously was importing

2480
01:47:07,869 --> 01:47:13,479
a lot of weed from all over the world to

2481
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:16,270
England into Europe and um he shared

2482
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:20,609
some of those red Lebanese suits was

2483
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:23,620
somebody in California and Bollywood BAM

2484
01:47:20,609 --> 01:47:26,139
was given the cut to hold on to because

2485
01:47:23,619 --> 01:47:28,029
they know he held on to stuff and he

2486
01:47:26,139 --> 01:47:30,789
gave it to me a few years ago and I've

2487
01:47:28,029 --> 01:47:33,219
been holding on to it you know it's from

2488
01:47:30,789 --> 01:47:35,859
the same stock you know like 100 percent

2489
01:47:33,219 --> 01:47:40,179
believe that from smell taste grow on

2490
01:47:35,859 --> 01:47:42,698
stone um it's just unfortunately we just

2491
01:47:40,179 --> 01:47:44,889
have the cutting we don't have seed

2492
01:47:42,698 --> 01:47:47,948
stock that's really interesting to note

2493
01:47:44,889 --> 01:47:49,359
so what can people expect from the

2494
01:47:47,948 --> 01:47:52,629
northern line crosses you've made like

2495
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:54,579
what type of plants would like whatever

2496
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:57,460
plants should someone expect if they buy

2497
01:47:54,579 --> 01:48:00,039
this packet and more importantly what

2498
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:02,730
would you advise each person to get you

2499
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:04,988
know so if I'm looking for a real super

2500
01:48:02,729 --> 01:48:08,379
narcotic one which one is the one I

2501
01:48:04,988 --> 01:48:11,709
should go for well to be honest with you

2502
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:14,409
if they're not up to par I'm not really

2503
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:19,179
seeing though and some of my favorites

2504
01:48:14,408 --> 01:48:22,079
this far are the black lights and pakiya

2505
01:48:19,179 --> 01:48:24,520
the super skully ash plant by the

2506
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:27,279
Northern Lights number one and since you

2507
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:28,810
see it's a selection of black dominant

2508
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:30,819
by Northern Lights number one just

2509
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:33,580
because of uh I like to smoke the

2510
01:48:30,819 --> 01:48:37,289
mothers a lot and you know I just like

2511
01:48:33,579 --> 01:48:40,800
that old-school narcotic indica bus yeah

2512
01:48:37,289 --> 01:48:43,050
and so just last question on Northern

2513
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:46,739
Lights for the moment often I've read

2514
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:48,480
things online saying that the SSC in a

2515
01:48:46,739 --> 01:48:50,909
lot of their crosses they used a Strang

2516
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:52,439
cord the basic five I've heard people

2517
01:48:50,909 --> 01:48:54,239
say that they think that's just like

2518
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:56,009
what they called the northern my it's

2519
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:58,829
five do you think they were the same or

2520
01:48:56,010 --> 01:49:02,640
different I think that they were the

2521
01:48:58,829 --> 01:49:07,769
same from my understanding the basic

2522
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:11,100
five was the no.5 awesome and so when

2523
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:12,900
people think of Afghan is in general

2524
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:14,760
they're often thinking of things like

2525
01:49:12,899 --> 01:49:16,500
you know barber cush and master cush

2526
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:18,650
like you know these real squat plans big

2527
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:22,140
fat leaves you know really broad leaves

2528
01:49:18,649 --> 01:49:23,849
however as we know there's there's a lot

2529
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:26,420
of Afghanistan are like that you know

2530
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:28,890
they're more thin they're more taller

2531
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:32,699
how do you think it got to the point

2532
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:34,500
where people think of Afghans as these

2533
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:36,510
you know squat indica plants and no one

2534
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:38,550
really thinks of them as you know these

2535
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:41,750
taller thinner leaf plants even though

2536
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:45,210
they were you know definitely they're

2537
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:46,770
from what I heard on a lot of the you

2538
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:49,260
know original hippies that went over

2539
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:51,330
here that make their own hash and they

2540
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:53,640
preferred the little bush weeds that

2541
01:49:51,329 --> 01:49:55,890
grew in the drainage ditches were these

2542
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:58,410
really fat leaved in because that you

2543
01:49:55,890 --> 01:50:01,410
know just really slow growing hard to

2544
01:49:58,409 --> 01:50:04,590
grow and what people are we're actually

2545
01:50:01,409 --> 01:50:08,430
growing fields of was a taller growing

2546
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:10,170
for already just easier to grow and you

2547
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:12,450
know easier to grow an acre of you know

2548
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:18,050
cuz growing an acre of bubba kush ism

2549
01:50:12,449 --> 01:50:22,590
and in the ass yeah for sure so you know

2550
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:25,440
bollywood BAM got a bunch of seeds from

2551
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:27,239
his father um unfortunately right before

2552
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:30,659
his father was killed by a suicide

2553
01:50:27,239 --> 01:50:33,510
bomber in Afghanistan and it's called

2554
01:50:30,659 --> 01:50:36,689
the he calls it the last laugh after his

2555
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:39,659
name his father and you know that's a

2556
01:50:36,689 --> 01:50:43,379
much taller growing longer internode

2557
01:50:39,659 --> 01:50:46,079
Afghan I guess his father had

2558
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:48,000
connections and he got it from you know

2559
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:50,539
I guess the Department of Agriculture

2560
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,819
over there in Afghanistan and mystery

2561
01:50:50,539 --> 01:50:56,729
250 years of provenance behind it

2562
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:59,340
documented it's not what we were all

2563
01:50:56,729 --> 01:51:02,779
thinking we were you know gonna see

2564
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:05,400
Afghani you know it was a taller berry

2565
01:51:02,779 --> 01:51:08,519
drought-resistant very tough plant that

2566
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:11,579
had CBD and the gene pool to seeing that

2567
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:14,130
gene pool purple in the gene pool green

2568
01:51:11,579 --> 01:51:16,519
in the gene pool on they were a denser

2569
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:19,109
and to conduct but they had a taller

2570
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:21,180
stretch your inner node structure and

2571
01:51:19,109 --> 01:51:23,849
you know something that would be better

2572
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:25,980
for a large-scale agricultural and on

2573
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:28,020
the only time he's released any of that

2574
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:31,109
was for the auction for a Mandelbrot

2575
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:34,590
song and he's kind of keeps that line

2576
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:36,329
tight say would you guys ever consider

2577
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:38,100
working really or you just don't see it

2578
01:51:36,329 --> 01:51:40,050
having that much breeding potentially

2579
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,940
because it's just so suited for just an

2580
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:46,409
entirely different I love going to a we

2581
01:51:41,939 --> 01:51:49,529
do you know Bama stoner a few open

2582
01:51:46,409 --> 01:51:53,609
pollination zon it and um that's a

2583
01:51:49,529 --> 01:51:56,069
question you'd have to ask him okay and

2584
01:51:53,609 --> 01:51:58,559
so how would you feel about ever doing a

2585
01:51:56,069 --> 01:52:00,389
cross way you're really kind of mixing

2586
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:02,910
old and new you know like one of your

2587
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:05,280
old school lines like you know maybe the

2588
01:52:02,909 --> 01:52:06,899
Panama with something totally new you

2589
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:08,579
know like just a throw a random one out

2590
01:52:06,899 --> 01:52:13,079
there you in pure cush you know one of

2591
01:52:08,579 --> 01:52:16,109
the kind of more newer hybrids well you

2592
01:52:13,079 --> 01:52:19,409
know you'll see some of those for me but

2593
01:52:16,109 --> 01:52:21,750
mostly you'll see the older you know

2594
01:52:19,409 --> 01:52:22,229
classics clones have stood the test of

2595
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:24,119
time

2596
01:52:22,229 --> 01:52:26,129
Bollywood BAM likes to breed with some

2597
01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:28,079
of the newer clones so you'll see that

2598
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:30,539
from him you know when he did the peanut

2599
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:32,779
butter cookies Noli headband those were

2600
01:52:30,539 --> 01:52:35,399
two examples of inbreeding in that style

2601
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:39,329
mostly what you're gonna see from keg U

2602
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:41,670
is open pollination bland race pure

2603
01:52:39,329 --> 01:52:42,500
sativas so that's the cool thing when we

2604
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:45,000
come together

2605
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:46,859
Hannibal like something probably would

2606
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,800
being like something I like something in

2607
01:52:46,859 --> 01:52:53,069
cave you like something we all share

2608
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:56,340
genetics and then I've read for on what

2609
01:52:53,069 --> 01:52:59,130
we like and so are you kind of the same

2610
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:01,230
school of thought of what I think DJ

2611
01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:02,670
short is kind of quoted as saying is

2612
01:53:01,229 --> 01:53:03,529
that you know at the end of the day all

2613
01:53:02,670 --> 01:53:06,618
that really matter

2614
01:53:03,529 --> 01:53:09,198
is the end effect and so I guess the

2615
01:53:06,618 --> 01:53:11,029
underlying question I want any exam what

2616
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:13,219
makes something worthwhile breeding for

2617
01:53:11,029 --> 01:53:16,179
you to just come down to effect or does

2618
01:53:13,219 --> 01:53:21,408
it have to be a compromise of things so

2619
01:53:16,179 --> 01:53:24,859
it's 100% effect I want you know to

2620
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:27,799
breed for strong indicus you know I

2621
01:53:24,859 --> 01:53:29,479
remember and I won a half and does a the

2622
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,210
favorites in my collection and they have

2623
01:53:29,479 --> 01:53:35,658
them fresher we you know rejuvenated not

2624
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:38,480
you know 15 to 30 year old cuts is a you

2625
01:53:35,658 --> 01:53:42,948
know really exciting thought yeah for

2626
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:45,468
sure and so what is the biggest fee you

2627
01:53:42,948 --> 01:53:47,089
have about the sweeping at slash you

2628
01:53:45,469 --> 01:53:48,770
know kind of unrolling of legalization

2629
01:53:47,090 --> 01:53:50,750
in California how do you think it's

2630
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:54,949
gonna affect things positively and

2631
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:56,929
negatively well unfortunately there's a

2632
01:53:54,948 --> 01:53:58,879
lot of people getting into it that see

2633
01:53:56,929 --> 01:54:01,880
nothing but dollar signs and they're

2634
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:03,920
growing way too much weed that's why we

2635
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:05,750
went for the 10,000 square foot permit

2636
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:08,658
it's actually the smallest permit

2637
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:10,670
available and you know that way we can

2638
01:54:08,658 --> 01:54:12,710
pay attention to our we in Hannah bolt

2639
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:16,250
and I can't grow it and it'll be grown

2640
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:19,578
by us and not by irrigation or other

2641
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:22,250
people that we hire to work we can

2642
01:54:19,578 --> 01:54:24,828
actually handle it ourselves and with

2643
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:27,380
you know but you know I had to basically

2644
01:54:24,828 --> 01:54:29,630
you know spend every single penny we'd

2645
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:31,909
ever saved in our life just to do it and

2646
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:34,730
it's been extremely stressful and the

2647
01:54:31,908 --> 01:54:37,879
fact that you know it is gonna be

2648
01:54:34,729 --> 01:54:40,729
competitive it's gonna be hard you know

2649
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:42,788
for certain people to be nice like they

2650
01:54:40,729 --> 01:54:45,529
were sharing genetics with friends and

2651
01:54:42,788 --> 01:54:47,630
you know the greed you know just because

2652
01:54:45,529 --> 01:54:50,618
everyone's putting their whole life on

2653
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:53,090
the risk that that's not a good thing

2654
01:54:50,618 --> 01:54:55,880
you know the people getting into it from

2655
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:59,300
other industries just for money that's

2656
01:54:55,880 --> 01:55:02,840
not a good thing old school people being

2657
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:04,730
left out and taking advantage of you

2658
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:07,730
know that's the worst thing that's why I

2659
01:55:04,729 --> 01:55:10,698
advise anybody team up with your friends

2660
01:55:07,729 --> 01:55:12,759
and try to get a permit you know go ever

2661
01:55:10,698 --> 01:55:15,859
wherever you can you gotta get them now

2662
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:16,409
are you gonna be shut out in California

2663
01:55:15,859 --> 01:55:18,389
when

2664
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:20,430
let's you know keep the power with the

2665
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:23,010
people that have been pioneering and

2666
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:26,159
working with this plant their whole

2667
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:27,750
lives they deserve it you know one of

2668
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:30,539
the good things that's gonna come out of

2669
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:32,520
it is you know you know me giving them

2670
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:34,380
other collection and a place where you

2671
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:36,600
know I can go over 99 plants and keep

2672
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:40,650
them legally safe because in Santa Cruz

2673
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:43,380
I'm only allowed 99 and then he's being

2674
01:55:40,649 --> 01:55:44,879
able to select over 99 without fear you

2675
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:47,159
know and to be able to show stuff like

2676
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:48,659
that you know to people on Instagram you

2677
01:55:47,159 --> 01:55:51,920
know because a lot of times I don't get

2678
01:55:48,659 --> 01:55:53,639
to see everything just for a safety sake

2679
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:56,279
yeah without a doubt

2680
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:58,340
and so just to play devil's advocate

2681
01:55:56,279 --> 01:56:01,829
let's say the worst case situation

2682
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:03,840
happens where there is just a few large

2683
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:05,550
companies mass-producing really bad

2684
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,739
quality wheat do you think in that

2685
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:09,300
situation things would revert back to

2686
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:12,179
how they were before legalization where

2687
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:14,489
we go back to you know people just doing

2688
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:16,260
stuff underground growing you know the

2689
01:56:14,489 --> 01:56:19,529
better stuff and you know the black

2690
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:22,949
market blooms again so you know I like

2691
01:56:19,529 --> 01:56:24,989
to think that you know this show will

2692
01:56:22,949 --> 01:56:26,909
hopefully encourage people in California

2693
01:56:24,989 --> 01:56:29,729
if they don't have their permits to go

2694
01:56:26,909 --> 01:56:32,460
out and get their permits I would like

2695
01:56:29,729 --> 01:56:35,129
to see the people that have been in the

2696
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:38,159
game stay in the game you know but like

2697
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:40,109
that you know if you know I said Hannah

2698
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:42,479
Bolton high risk in our whole life

2699
01:56:40,109 --> 01:56:44,399
savings on it and we're gonna work our

2700
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:48,239
hardest to make it work you know and we

2701
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:52,229
work hard but you know if it didn't [ __ ]

2702
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:54,059
I'd be in another state in a house

2703
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:56,219
someone else paying all the [ __ ]

2704
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:58,620
bills you know I'm never gonna stop I

2705
01:56:56,220 --> 01:57:01,770
won't stop I can't stop so what the [ __ ]

2706
01:56:58,619 --> 01:57:04,920
I do I didn't have any fear then I'm not

2707
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:07,770
gonna have fear you know but I'm putting

2708
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:11,310
everything I got into making it is no

2709
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:13,740
legal industry and so a question that's

2710
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:15,960
quite specifically relevant to Australia

2711
01:57:13,739 --> 01:57:19,319
do you think that people should

2712
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:21,960
compromise for access to medicine if

2713
01:57:19,319 --> 01:57:24,689
it's you know sub quality you know is it

2714
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:27,600
worth allowing like a pseudo medical

2715
01:57:24,689 --> 01:57:30,639
system through if all it is

2716
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:32,820
you know like large companies even like

2717
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:35,079
specifically people like tobacco

2718
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:37,509
industries are really looking at getting

2719
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:39,880
in the game if it was just a few big

2720
01:57:37,510 --> 01:57:43,000
providers like them would you settle for

2721
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:44,529
that in terms of like as a society

2722
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,750
should you settle for that or should we

2723
01:57:44,529 --> 01:57:48,399
be like no have to be able to grow alone

2724
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:50,789
or at least have you know some means

2725
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:53,309
have access to high-quality medicine

2726
01:57:50,789 --> 01:57:55,899
yeah I say over grow the government

2727
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:58,270
everyone in Australia should be growing

2728
01:57:55,899 --> 01:58:00,670
their own medicine legal or not you know

2729
01:57:58,270 --> 01:58:01,240
if it's not legal just don't tell

2730
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:04,090
anybody

2731
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:06,099
don't tell anybody just you know do it

2732
01:58:04,090 --> 01:58:09,069
like we did in Virginia old school days

2733
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:12,789
and make the good medicine there for the

2734
01:58:09,069 --> 01:58:15,009
people and grow a good and from form

2735
01:58:12,789 --> 01:58:18,039
your cruisers and you know form your

2736
01:58:15,010 --> 01:58:20,289
networks to get the buds to the the

2737
01:58:18,039 --> 01:58:22,630
patient's underground you know

2738
01:58:20,289 --> 01:58:25,090
definitely don't trust the man and grow

2739
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:25,930
your medicine you know I everybody

2740
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:28,119
should be able to grow on their own

2741
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:30,159
medicine and if they're too sick to grow

2742
01:58:28,119 --> 01:58:31,689
their own medicine they should know that

2743
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:34,809
someone's gonna grow up for them that's

2744
01:58:31,689 --> 01:58:37,750
not [ __ ] spraying pesticides on it or

2745
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:39,580
you know doesn't give two shits about it

2746
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:43,119
because I feel like it's a type of plant

2747
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:47,019
that needs love and it needs you know a

2748
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:49,989
caring person to take care of it or the

2749
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:53,650
medicine ain't gonna be the same yeah

2750
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:56,500
yeah I'm definitely the same belief and

2751
01:58:53,649 --> 01:58:59,469
so just to kind of get into our last

2752
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:02,310
couple of questions who's a breeder who

2753
01:58:59,470 --> 01:59:04,750
you really like their work you know and

2754
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:07,800
you know bonus points if it's not

2755
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:13,390
someone who's just doing lad Raceway

2756
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:17,920
archive CSI top dog freeborn selections

2757
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:21,100
does puros bode seeds I know I'm leaving

2758
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:23,920
some out because it's you know it's the

2759
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:26,579
actually I feel like it's the golden age

2760
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:30,730
of America American breeders right now

2761
01:59:26,579 --> 01:59:33,250
with you know the selections and this

2762
01:59:30,729 --> 01:59:35,049
the the community you know being able to

2763
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:37,720
get so many different clones off of

2764
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:39,279
Instagram and stuff and so many

2765
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:40,969
different people are breeding and going

2766
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:43,250
in different directions

2767
01:59:40,969 --> 01:59:45,529
it's gonna be cool to see how it

2768
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:48,050
progresses because I know coastal seeds

2769
01:59:45,529 --> 01:59:51,710
is going to be trying to provide the

2770
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:53,150
land race building blocks and you know

2771
01:59:51,710 --> 01:59:56,469
there's people out there trying to

2772
01:59:53,149 --> 01:59:58,759
progress stuff and bring new flavors so

2773
01:59:56,469 --> 02:00:00,409
there's just so many different people

2774
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:03,469
with different goals and so many people

2775
02:00:00,409 --> 02:00:07,039
breeding in America that it's you know

2776
02:00:03,469 --> 02:00:09,500
it's it's kind of the Golden Age and say

2777
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:13,069
if you were just a breed oh sorry sorry

2778
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:14,869
and so if you were just a grower and you

2779
02:00:13,069 --> 02:00:17,090
had to go out right now and you had to

2780
02:00:14,869 --> 02:00:23,029
buy one pack of seeds modern hybrid

2781
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:25,789
which pack would you buy chem dog from

2782
02:00:23,029 --> 02:00:28,279
top dog one of his pure chem dog crosses

2783
02:00:25,789 --> 02:00:31,130
preferably one of the Trez dog back

2784
02:00:28,279 --> 02:00:36,859
crosses because I feel like the the Trez

2785
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:38,779
dog tripled that cross chem d he made is

2786
02:00:36,859 --> 02:00:42,439
one of the best breedings and the

2787
02:00:38,779 --> 02:00:44,539
marijuana community in history you know

2788
02:00:42,439 --> 02:00:48,948
he gave those treads dog seeds to high

2789
02:00:44,539 --> 02:00:51,680
and lonesome high lonesome bred dog

2790
02:00:48,948 --> 02:00:56,210
waltz and the Appalachia with Bodie bred

2791
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:58,159
with and then JJ kept him and worked him

2792
02:00:56,210 --> 02:01:01,448
himself and made the star dog and the

2793
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:04,969
original in New York City diesel and

2794
02:01:01,448 --> 02:01:08,509
there are so many keeper star dog cuts

2795
02:01:04,969 --> 02:01:11,149
and my dog Walt's cut is one of the most

2796
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:12,829
amazing and all the amazing stuff that's

2797
02:01:11,149 --> 02:01:16,759
come from the Appalachia

2798
02:01:12,829 --> 02:01:19,609
so I'd say uh you know just gonna have

2799
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:21,800
to go with dogs that is history stack

2800
02:01:19,609 --> 02:01:24,619
down and go for some inbred come from JJ

2801
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:28,130
if I had to go for one half it sounds

2802
02:01:24,619 --> 02:01:30,170
good and so what are your kind of you

2803
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:34,789
know top five top ten favorite strains

2804
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:38,690
for just smoking yourself cam dog og

2805
02:01:34,789 --> 02:01:43,100
black domina my hash plants and then

2806
02:01:38,689 --> 02:01:44,779
more Kim dogged a nice tight list but I

2807
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:46,460
love everything if I didn't love it I

2808
02:01:44,779 --> 02:01:49,219
wouldn't keep it

2809
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:50,649
so my headband is one of my favorites I

2810
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:53,119
love Sour Diesel

2811
02:01:50,649 --> 02:01:54,498
there's so many of them I love all these

2812
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:56,899
new strains I loved OC

2813
02:01:54,498 --> 02:01:59,359
I love the real good cookie cuts I love

2814
02:01:56,899 --> 02:02:01,248
this one size sugar you know I just got

2815
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:03,920
that papaya that's pretty impressive

2816
02:02:01,248 --> 02:02:07,010
stuff I'm smoking on that now you know

2817
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:10,130
the strawberry banana from Crockett you

2818
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:12,579
know that's some serious fire a lot of

2819
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:16,489
stuff from Bodie it's a really good

2820
02:02:12,578 --> 02:02:18,049
hippie Slayer dread bread yeah it's

2821
02:02:16,488 --> 02:02:19,879
pretty deep I you know I could never

2822
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:22,099
even remember all the clones I have at

2823
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:25,748
once that's why you know labeling them a

2824
02:02:22,099 --> 02:02:29,869
list is very important yeah no worries

2825
02:02:25,748 --> 02:02:32,448
so if you could have one strain back

2826
02:02:29,868 --> 02:02:36,288
that you used to have but have lost what

2827
02:02:32,448 --> 02:02:39,799
one would be there's so many so one is

2828
02:02:36,288 --> 02:02:43,689
tough I had SEC Mathis bubble berry from

2829
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:46,369
like 96 and that stuff was amazing every

2830
02:02:43,689 --> 02:02:49,219
Fino and there was amazing

2831
02:02:46,368 --> 02:02:51,288
um I never had my hands on the rapture

2832
02:02:49,219 --> 02:02:53,538
kill but you know that would obviously

2833
02:02:51,288 --> 02:02:56,029
be it but I never actually got it I did

2834
02:02:53,538 --> 02:03:00,288
get some seeds and I later across those

2835
02:02:56,029 --> 02:03:02,389
NL ak-47 and made some some really good

2836
02:03:00,288 --> 02:03:05,210
hybrids that I would love to have those

2837
02:03:02,389 --> 02:03:09,618
I was growing those in in Colorado in

2838
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:12,498
like 99 2000 and I'll a K by super

2839
02:03:09,618 --> 02:03:15,618
Silver Haze crossed into the rapture and

2840
02:03:12,498 --> 02:03:17,389
I had to feena's back then and anyone I

2841
02:03:15,618 --> 02:03:19,549
smoked him with Tina would admit they

2842
02:03:17,389 --> 02:03:21,469
were one-hit [ __ ] and I'd have to say

2843
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:25,538
those unfortunately I've lost all the

2844
02:03:21,469 --> 02:03:28,279
seeds from that line yep and so who's

2845
02:03:25,538 --> 02:03:33,460
some breeders you'd love to do a collab

2846
02:03:28,279 --> 02:03:38,800
with Bodie

2847
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:41,179
si si top dog keeping a Kanda

2848
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,130
those are guys that you know I have to

2849
02:03:41,179 --> 02:03:45,670
put in work for years I highly highly

2850
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:45,670
recommend

2851
02:03:46,479 --> 02:03:53,570
yeah awesome and so if you could go back

2852
02:03:50,988 --> 02:03:55,609
in time to anywhere to get one landrace

2853
02:03:53,569 --> 02:03:57,198
strain or seeds you know from anywhere

2854
02:03:55,609 --> 02:04:00,948
where would you go and what would you

2855
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:03,408
get I probably be buying from sensi

2856
02:04:00,948 --> 02:04:04,819
seeds a bunch of hash plant and black

2857
02:04:03,408 --> 02:04:07,219
diamond right when they were released

2858
02:04:04,819 --> 02:04:08,009
but if it was you know I had to go for

2859
02:04:07,219 --> 02:04:10,739
land race

2860
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:13,340
be in Afghanistan and you know like 1977

2861
02:04:10,738 --> 02:04:18,449
and the Hindu Kush mountains close to

2862
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:20,430
Pakistan nice and so final question what

2863
02:04:18,449 --> 02:04:24,059
are your top traits you look for in a

2864
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:27,000
man when you're breeding um he's got to

2865
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:28,770
be like the sisters that are keepers you

2866
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,869
know if the sisters are keepers I ain't

2867
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:33,360
gonna [ __ ] breed with the male you

2868
02:04:30,869 --> 02:04:36,510
know keep him around for a long time and

2869
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:38,639
torch room you know yes if make sure he

2870
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:41,310
stands yeah make sure you can stand that

2871
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:44,460
test of time and yeah don't you know

2872
