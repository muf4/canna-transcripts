good bubba how are you

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,438
i'm doing good first question i wanted

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,519
to ask a little deviant from the normal

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,199
first question we almost got into it a

28
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,200
second ago but i want you to tell me now

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,439
what are you smoking on at the moment

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
uh lots of rainbow just

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,359
lots and lots of rainbow i had some

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,600
rainbow hybrids as well but nothing

33
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,478
really beats rainbows so i just don't

34
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,438
get tired ever or i haven't yet

35
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:28,000
so you're smoking the pure

36
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,839
yeah the rainbow ssog i've had a little

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,799
bit of the skittles by rainbow as well

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,439
lately and it's been super good but it's

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,799
hard the rainbow ss just has that

40
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,839
dankness to it and i just can't get

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
enough of that chocolatey

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,920
rankness

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
all right well i mean we've got a

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,359
plethora of questions to ask on that but

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,920
we'll put that aside for the moment jump

46
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,640
back to the start what was in fact your

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,719
first experience with cannabis

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,599
oh i was born into it like my first

49
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,718
memory in life was uh being on the boat

50
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,239
i was

51
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,078
i couldn't have been more than like two

52
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,879
or three in my own

53
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,718
i was up on the lake with my uncle and

54
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,959
everywhere we went with my dad my uncle

55
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,439
it smelled like skunk so i really didn't

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,759
know why we always smelled skunks always

57
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,318
smelled skunks and then as i got older

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,639
and realized it was the cannabis that

59
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,958
always made it smell like skunk that

60
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,079
you know it was kind of a

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,719
just like a

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,840
part of life with with me growing up i

63
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,039
was just always around cannabis

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
and so

65
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,719
i got this kind of theory that the

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,120
cannabis you're exposed to when you're

67
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,039
early on can often be some of the stuff

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
which is kind of the most impacting on

69
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,639
you do you find that to be the case i

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
mean if we look at your work that you

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,919
know there doesn't seem to be any

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
apparent skunky stuff in it was it just

73
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,318
a memory or is it kind of imprinted on

74
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:50,079
you in the way i described

75
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,159
no um i chased the skunks forever i

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,040
still have a lot of skunk work and

77
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,598
rainbow has so much of the tie in it and

78
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,759
uh that was always a big part of it and

79
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,518
the reason why i went down the

80
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,679
rainbow journey

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,439
is because my dad always talked about

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
the chocolate ties the chocolate ties

83
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,158
the chocolate ties and then the acapulco

84
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,560
gold which hopefully i work with down

85
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,359
the down the line um

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,439
so

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
he always told me about like in the 70s

88
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,120
they would get these

89
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,120
these sticks the that tasted like

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
chocolate and uh

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
so they would smoke it taste like

92
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,479
chocolate and it was always something i

93
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,798
was all like wait we it tastes like

94
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,359
chocolate you know as a kid and i'm a

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,319
candy junkie still to this day

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,040
um i love making candy i don't eat

97
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,919
store-bought candy i make candy and just

98
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,079
so i can get rid of that craving so

99
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,878
that's why i started the rainbow really

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
was on that that tip the

101
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,840
the ties

102
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,878
wow okay

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,719
so

104
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,798
what was when you were younger and you

105
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,239
first started smoking do you have any

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,400
idea of what would come some of the

107
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,759
strains you're actually first exposed to

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
when you were smoking and were they more

109
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,280
indica or sativa stuff you know it

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,879
really depends there was two different

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,519
types

112
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,919
one during the harvests and humble all

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,680
the outdoor that was going around

114
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,079
most of it was just called like green

115
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,160
bud or kind but we did get things like

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,359
northern lights and we did get a lot of

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,120
cali oh um my dad had a lot of calio

118
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:25,918
around and then um there was a lot of uh

119
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
south american type strength that my dad

120
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,680
had

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,919
in seed forms so they grew a lot of that

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,519
but believe it or not a lot of the stuff

123
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,560
and the

124
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,359
because

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,160
we had dry seasons around here where the

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,240
outdoor growers were out of cannabis so

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
we had a lot of commercial flour coming

128
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
up from mexico

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,478
and um so we smoked a lot of commercial

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,600
flour to me a lot of it was

131
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,240
a lot of it was the orange influences so

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,199
it was what now we know as you know

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,439
calio or those kind of strains there was

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,240
so much of this lime green

135
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,879
smelled like straight orange trees

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,639
and that was truly one of my favorites

137
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,719
and that's why you'll see in a lot of my

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,199
other early work there was a lot of

139
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,600
orange influences in there because it

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,600
reminded me of you know 13 14 year olds

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,360
pulling apart these bricks and smelling

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
that orange juice just hitting you in

143
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
the face

144
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,359
that's really interesting because this

145
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,680
possibly the first time we've ever heard

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,680
someone express the sentiment that you

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,560
know they they had some really nice kind

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,720
of brick weed sent in essentially

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
um the interesting thing about kali o is

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
i was chatting about this the other day

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,560
to adam dunn it's it's one of those ones

152
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,038
which is really the the defining example

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
of like how things come in waves of

154
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,159
popularity you know like it used to be

155
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
big it fell off a bit then we had the

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,000
tangie resurgence i don't know if you'd

157
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,839
say it's fallen off but you know it's

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,918
it's not at the peak anymore do you

159
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,839
foresee it coming back soon and more

160
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,159
importantly as you alluded do you think

161
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,918
that those orange vibes do trace

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
directly back to like the mexican land

163
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,959
races specifically

164
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,800
i personally i'm going to start with the

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,199
last part first i personally think that

166
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,800
it does come from from the mexican

167
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,160
strains i was importing

168
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,439
tons of kilos of cannabis in the 70s and

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
80s and

170
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,600
so much of it was orange

171
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,919
smelling flavoring

172
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,319
cannabis um he told me tons of stories

173
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,079
about it and

174
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
so like california and mexico were

175
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,758
together you know it's just it's one

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,038
thing so if it was grown in mexico it's

177
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,120
grown in california and that's where my

178
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,800
belief would lie with the orange is that

179
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,800
it was coming up from

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,520
mexico and you know compressed

181
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
commercial and the seeds were very few

182
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,758
in these bricks and when you found these

183
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,879
seeds you kept them and you grew them i

184
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,639
won't

185
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,439
say his name but my dad had a really

186
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,680
good friend that he worked with through

187
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,000
mexico that he brought him up and

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,439
um he's still with us today my dad isn't

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,839
but his friend is and i've had the

190
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,680
conversation with him where he said that

191
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,478
when he was a kid that was what was

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,720
probably the area of mexico was the

193
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,159
orange cannabis

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,160
drinks it was everything smelled orange

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,280
the second part which was the first part

196
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,360
do i believe it will come back you know

197
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,918
i feel when i open a jar of the orange

198
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,439
flower and i get that nice zesty orange

199
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,038
in the morning it helps

200
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,038
wake me up in the morning you know it

201
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,360
helps get me going like a cup of coffee

202
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,918
just the terpene profile of it the way

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
it activates my brain so for me it'll

204
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,439
never go away

205
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
i'll always grow something with that

206
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,360
orange profile i'll always have

207
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,000
something just for my own personal

208
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,960
use i think there's a lot of the

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,759
guys like that as well who remember it

210
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,959
from

211
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,680
the 80s and the 90s or even further back

212
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,478
so they'll always have it around um if

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,759
it

214
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:58,478
gets to the trendy area again i think so

215
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
many people worked with tangie and so

216
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,878
many people

217
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,800
crossed with tangie and grew tangie and

218
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,160
that's all you heard was tangy and

219
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
orange

220
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,080
this orange that i think a lot of the

221
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,399
younger guys are burnt out on it so

222
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,758
it'll be a while before it hits to where

223
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,478
it was five six years ago

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,160
yeah that's a that's a really good way

225
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,439
to express it i kind of

226
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,280
think i'm definitely in agreeance with

227
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,918
you on that one the interesting thing

228
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,159
that the kind of tangy wave did bring to

229
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,079
the forefront i think is the idea of

230
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
terps and maybe kind of the more

231
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
underlying argument of

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
possibly terps being more important than

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,200
potency i mean for me tng was one of

234
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,120
those ones where it often

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
both from me and from people i know cop

236
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
criticism in regards to the potency but

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,200
you know it got compliments in regards

238
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,439
to the terpenes so like do you feel

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
that's kind of a representative of the

240
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
scene and the way breeding is occurring

241
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,040
in general at the moment

242
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,278
yeah it's kind of funny like what was it

243
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,519
four or five years ago everything even

244
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,919
more recently but i'm going to say that

245
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,240
time where people were showing off these

246
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,799
huge numbers and their what they were

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
bri or what they were being tested at

248
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,799
and all these

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,519
massive 30 32 well somebody was always

250
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,039
one up in somebody

251
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,080
or breeders

252
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,120
using profile the terpene profile and

253
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,440
not just

254
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,799
like oh look it's fruity it's orange but

255
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
like i mean

256
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,879
or it's grapey or like purple punch for

257
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,278
instance i mean how many people are

258
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,200
working with purple punch right now and

259
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,480
everybody has the same chief complaint

260
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,278
it doesn't get you

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,879
there it doesn't have that punch that

262
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,039
they should just be called purple or

263
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:45,600
they they talk down about it but the

264
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:47,599
flavor of it is so good it really is and

265
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
how long have people been smoking cigars

266
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,879
just to have the flavor they don't

267
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,719
inhale a cigar they just smoke it just

268
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,439
to taste it and

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,600
so i always think that we will have that

270
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,080
i always think that now that people

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,879
really have isolated terpenes in the

272
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,160
certain concentrates and oils and things

273
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,278
like that now i think it's going to get

274
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,000
grow even further because of that like

275
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,078
so let's say you can isolate the

276
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,200
one from this strain but you can add it

277
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,639
to this concentrate to make this type of

278
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,000
sauce

279
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,919
that's where so many people are going um

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,919
you can walk around the shows how many

281
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,599
shows do you go to now or

282
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,078
tables do you go to a booth where you

283
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,480
see like amazing flower they're not as

284
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,919
often where you see concentrate

285
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,720
everywhere and that terpene profile is

286
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,199
what's selling those concentrates

287
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,480
so i do i really do think that the

288
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
terpenes

289
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
the smells the flavors and the taste

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,879
will

291
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
that's where most breeders are at right

292
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,360
now

293
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
yeah

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,320
so

295
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,320
last little question i wanted to ask

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,720
about the orange slash how should i say

297
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,079
tangy terpenes for the moment

298
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,240
there's been some rumors that the uh

299
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,919
tangy may not be the genetics that it

300
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,720
says it is have you heard anything about

301
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:10,159
that would you shed any light

302
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,240
i've heard a ton of people say um

303
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,199
i truly don't know

304
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,799
what

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,680
they claim that tangi is i i don't i

306
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,199
it wasn't something i was super fired up

307
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,919
about um

308
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
i always had calio i i've had calios

309
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,120
since

310
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,919
one of my first moms

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,759
so when the tangy came out and people

312
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,439
were smelling it and showing it and

313
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,078
saying hey check this out that was all

314
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
oh that's kind of like what i've been

315
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,439
growing for all these years so i love

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,440
that strain like i love it and they were

317
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,640
like well it's called tangy and i'm like

318
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,800
well tanju that's confusing to me like

319
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,879
what is tangi

320
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,599
i believe they say it's like a skunk an

321
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,639
orange skunk something like that um

322
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,399
but

323
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
crosstalk

324
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,360
okay so they say it's a skunk across the

325
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,278
calio is is that what are this yeah

326
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,560
okay so i

327
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,200
could imagine it being a caglio cross

328
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,479
my only thing with it is is it has a

329
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
chemically

330
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
orange

331
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,440
now i know calio i can i can smell calio

332
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,000
i can taste kelio i can do all that now

333
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,279
could the skunk change that in the

334
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,399
in the gene pool sure sure it could but

335
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,879
to me

336
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,799
like there is uh what's his name the

337
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,559
breeder who did the

338
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,240
agent orange so so i pers there you go i

339
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,838
personally think

340
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,399
that the tangie would be more of the

341
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,880
agent orange style of terpenes because

342
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
i've smelled that as well and of course

343
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,000
they're all going to come from the same

344
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
gene pool but

345
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,919
i don't know to me the

346
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,838
tangy has more of that chemical orange

347
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,519
where calio has a more of a sweet

348
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,240
mundane

349
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,839
orange juicy smell yeah okay interesting

350
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,399
so

351
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,959
jumping back to kind of the earlier days

352
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,799
what was it that initially inspired you

353
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,278
to breed was it something that happened

354
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,078
or was it another breeder what got the

355
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,078
ball rolling for you

356
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
i wanted to make straight from me

357
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,278
honestly um

358
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
when i started

359
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,799
i've been doing it

360
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,159
when was one of my first projects my

361
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,078
first some of my first projects i was

362
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,919
trying to recreate a

363
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,958
big korean skunk

364
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,559
things like that um the old asian lines

365
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,479
so i was getting a bunch of those kind

366
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,439
of lines and i was working with them and

367
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
um

368
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,800
stuff so i was trying to make the old

369
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,120
like 70s style

370
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,679
in seed form you know so i could enjoy

371
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,399
it with my dad and stuff like that and i

372
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,359
was growing a ton of like mexican seeds

373
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,159
in the

374
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,919
early 90s and things like that for him

375
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,399
and he'd be able to come over to the

376
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,759
house and like see my little

377
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,198
i wouldn't even call him little bushes

378
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,360
my monster like 10 foot wide bushes and

379
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,198
things and be able to pick flowers off

380
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,680
because he'd literally come over chop

381
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,759
them off fresh take him home and try and

382
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,120
cure him himself because i just didn't

383
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,278
do it right

384
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,839
so our styles are different i let i

385
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,439
leave leaves on so everything gets

386
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,440
chopped with all these

387
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,839
it gets trimmed later he trimmed

388
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,839
everything off when it was still wet and

389
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,880
hung it that way but that's beyond the

390
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,040
point so

391
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,320
that was really what it was is that i

392
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:27,120
liked cannabis and i didn't want to

393
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,278
try to buy a clone from somebody so they

394
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
knew i was growing you know because it

395
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,958
wasn't always

396
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,159
legal to grow these giant girls i was

397
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,638
doing were not

398
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:40,078
medical growers these were in the middle

399
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,839
of manzanita trees in buckets or on the

400
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,799
side of mountains where i was falling in

401
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,199
with rattlesnakes and climbing up on my

402
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,519
gut and trying to find water to take up

403
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,439
to these mountains and so that was

404
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,519
really the reason why i started to do

405
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,399
the breeding was

406
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,600
because i wanted to

407
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,159
create stuff where nobody else knew

408
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,320
i was still growing i wanted to have my

409
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,559
own seeds and be sufficient on my own

410
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
merit and not try to find

411
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,679
clones because there were clones at the

412
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,199
time

413
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,679
they just weren't

414
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,519
amazing going back i wish i still had

415
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,759
some of those clones i mean i remember

416
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,440
when romulan first came around and i

417
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,198
passed on it and i still kicked myself

418
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
in the ass every day for passing on that

419
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,879
cut

420
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,879
yeah romulan's one of the interesting

421
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,120
ones it's almost had a resurgence in

422
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,600
popularity the thing which i find most

423
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,560
interesting about romula is as far as i

424
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,720
can tell seems to be the oldest clone

425
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,479
that there is so to speak like it's

426
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,759
popped in 69 as far as we can tell um

427
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,480
have you heard of anything older than

428
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,720
that seems like it might be the one

429
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,560
i'm confused on romulan because i was

430
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
under the oppression it was named after

431
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,638
the

432
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,199
star trek

433
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,720
generation the romulans so when people

434
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,278
tell me that it was

435
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,079
created that long ago and named after

436
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,879
star trek it blows my mind so that part

437
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,599
always confuses me um

438
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,559
but

439
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
yeah

440
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,359
i don't really think a lot of the old

441
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,079
breeders were naming stuff

442
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,839
like i had an issue even naming stuff

443
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,838
like where it would just be all i never

444
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,800
put a name on it

445
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,199
so i think that's why it's harder to

446
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,039
date the cannabis because there wasn't a

447
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,039
name things weren't passed freely

448
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,799
everything was kept

449
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,120
under lock and key

450
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,599
so dating things is truly

451
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,839
truly hard um

452
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,920
everything is hearsay or somebody else's

453
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,759
you know word of mouth and it's a

454
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:41,360
conversation i i just don't like to have

455
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,120
um because

456
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
people like to take credit for things

457
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,639
when

458
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,240
maybe that was around before they you

459
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,639
know took credit for it or maybe it

460
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,879
wasn't or maybe they did

461
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,480
create it and if i say something and

462
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,720
somebody takes offense to what i'm

463
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
saying it causes a big drama so i just

464
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,759
let people

465
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
say what they want to say and claim what

466
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,919
they want to claim

467
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,639
yeah i can i can certainly understand

468
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,798
that so i mean i'm i'm not sure about

469
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
that romulan one myself like i it comes

470
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,679
from romulan joe and i know that he

471
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,199
adopted that persona after

472
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
you know maybe it's controversial but

473
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,480
after he was had the mendo joe persona

474
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,000
so

475
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,838
you know if i had to guess he was

476
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,679
mendojo and had the cut before he was

477
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,918
romulan joe so he mustn't have been

478
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
calling it romulan back there but yeah i

479
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,880
think you're right like that reference

480
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,359
of the word romulan doesn't really seem

481
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,960
to be around before star trek so

482
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,079
yeah interesting one with that being

483
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,079
said though

484
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,079
excluding romulan seeing as maybe it's

485
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,240
not um well i mean i think that clone's

486
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,918
pretty old but regardless what do you

487
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,599
know is to be or what do you think at

488
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,559
least is the oldest clone that you're

489
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,439
aware of

490
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,879
the oldest actual cut like yeah like i

491
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
mean obviously

492
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,080
it's a cut of a cut of a cut but like

493
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,679
you know it's still the same plan as the

494
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,519
original one

495
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,880
so some of my

496
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,359
the

497
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,960
so let me let me think of this real

498
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,119
quick um

499
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,519
it's funny because some of the original

500
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,839
clones i was seeing were literally

501
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,839
called kind buds

502
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:17,279
or green bud or orange bud which was

503
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,439
later known as calio

504
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,798
those were the ones that i remember

505
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,400
seeing when i was young um

506
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,440
and then you had your

507
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,360
your

508
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,519
south american strains so your gold

509
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,439
strains and things like that and once

510
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,079
again i seen these when i was a kid but

511
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,960
they never had a name it was called oh

512
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,558
that's that the kind bud or that's the

513
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,480
san diego buds or that is the green or

514
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,200
that is the orange or that's that

515
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,880
colombian that we have

516
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,519
and then um the other one was the

517
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,520
michoacan i think honestly one of the

518
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,119
oldest ones i remember was just the

519
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,038
michoacan

520
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,879
because that's what was getting brought

521
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:01,440
over in abundance in the brig

522
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,480
other than that i've heard the things

523
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,279
you know

524
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,960
things but i didn't see them i wasn't

525
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:11,038
there i was born in 1977 i have memories

526
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,279
you know into the 80s and those are the

527
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,798
ones i'll speak on

528
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,759
yeah okay

529
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,599
so

530
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,359
i think something which has been really

531
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,959
interesting to me

532
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,279
and probably to many a lot of other

533
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,519
people as well is the idea of

534
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,440
what do you think it was at least that

535
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,200
in your mind that caused you to take

536
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,880
such a kind of a different approach to

537
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,600
your brother in regards to breeding

538
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,520
because i mean he put it i think pretty

539
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,079
eloquently himself like you know he's

540
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,240
got a very kind of small pool that he

541
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,798
sticks with and and you cover everything

542
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
else and i was like that's a good way of

543
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,960
putting it you know like how did it end

544
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,960
up to be that way

545
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,038
i

546
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,038
you know

547
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:58,400
okay so uh matt really worked this the

548
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,798
same pool he was really dedicated to

549
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,960
that urkel from the lavender

550
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,720
and the sedc those were

551
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,519
his babies and

552
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
he

553
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,879
works them still to this day and i'm

554
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,599
actually happy that he's adding a little

555
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,039
bit of my work to the pool

556
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,439
um because my

557
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,960
my work is all at his work's amazing and

558
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,558
i think they'll play really really well

559
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,759
together um

560
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,839
i think a lot of my difference with it

561
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,279
was was that i didn't want to just do

562
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,000
the same thing

563
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,000
um i had a lot of different

564
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,200
versions of

565
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,119
plants at my disposal like he had um

566
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,200
his purples i was really working the

567
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,359
like the michoacan at the time or these

568
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,279
ties at the time or

569
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,599
calio those were

570
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,558
the ones but also

571
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,119
i was

572
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:50,000
all over the world um

573
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,119
i was traveling everywhere um i was

574
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,159
working tons tons tons in the outdoors

575
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,719
and i was seeing a lot more of what i

576
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,960
could push plants to yield

577
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,159
um for uh you know reasons lots of flour

578
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,000
bigger yields bigger plants

579
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,320
those kind of things for outdoor growing

580
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,480
was really really what i was looking for

581
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,759
um and plus

582
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,200
i would read for myself what i liked

583
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,279
what i

584
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,038
um i really liked

585
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,639
the tie

586
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,720
the chocolate cherry like i was saying

587
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,960
was way too strong for me

588
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,960
uh

589
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,519
if i worked it settled it down a little

590
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,480
bit and i could make it very beneficial

591
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,879
for me

592
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,200
i just take away that peak

593
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,960
of the eye but keep all the parts that

594
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,519
made you smile and make

595
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,679
you happy and um so i think we just

596
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,839
really had different visions

597
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,000
on what we wanted to do i think he

598
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,199
really really wanted to isolate and

599
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,919
really really wanted to make this

600
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
perfect purple line which he made a ton

601
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,360
of them

602
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,558
and i wanted to spread

603
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,279
out make a bunch of different stuff and

604
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,319
see

605
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:07,038
what i like the most and

606
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,519
things along that nature

607
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,359
so do you kind of limit yourself in any

608
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,119
way in the sense that he does in regards

609
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,798
to maybe genetics like is there anything

610
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,798
you don't want to use or anything you

611
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,079
feel you definitely have to use type

612
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,720
thing or is it just kind of you don't

613
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:24,158
limit yourself like that

614
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,480
i definitely like using or starting from

615
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,760
older genetics i don't

616
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
really

617
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,919
like the whole pop of packages find a

618
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
male and make

619
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,320
work from it

620
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,158
um so i really really like

621
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,720
my chocolate cherry because it is a

622
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,200
chocolate chinese really like the red

623
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,919
one because it is my baby i really like

624
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
the rainbow because i've worked

625
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,559
all these lines to get there so i am

626
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,679
going to start isolating myself for a

627
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:53,759
while

628
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
pushing the rainbow line pushing the red

629
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,319
vine line and bringing the chocolate

630
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,759
cherry back but will i ever

631
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,759
just like say these are the only things

632
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,960
i'm going to work no

633
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,319
i find

634
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,240
so much beauty and so many of the plants

635
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,918
that i don't think i could ever just

636
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,599
isolate myself to

637
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
a specific strain

638
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,798
and just do those ones i

639
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,480
like too many plants i can see like i

640
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:19,679
was saying earlier i can see

641
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,079
commercial

642
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,200
brick flowers and i can find things in

643
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,918
it that i

644
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,480
think are cool or nice or i can find

645
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,720
some guy who's never grown the forest

646
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,440
outdoor and be all like oh man it has

647
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,519
like this certain smell or oh i like it

648
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,038
structure or hey it didn't have bugs

649
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,279
attack it you know just stuff like that

650
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,599
so i would never

651
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,200
uh just isolate my

652
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:47,918
strains i like to

653
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:51,840
i like to fiddle i'm uh like ocd ish so

654
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,840
i really am all over the place at times

chocolate thai female that i i came

669
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,000
it was

670
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,400
the only plant that i had personally

671
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,319
seen that tasted like milk chocolate

672
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,880
like it truly tasted like chocolate not

673
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,720
like hints of chocolate it tasted like

674
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,520
actual chocolate um

675
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,278
so when i had it

676
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,798
and then i had a

677
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:44,798
refs cherry tie which she just sent me a

678
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,440
sent us a ton more beans up

679
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,839
so i can further the work with it um it

680
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,720
just worked so well together and it's

681
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,879
like tight on time on time so i had to i

682
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,360
it was like something i had to do to

683
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,559
bring myself like a

684
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,319
tie to work thai exceeds the pot

685
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,480
to go through to find these perfect tie

686
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,798
strings

687
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,480
so what was the process of creating

688
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,119
rainbow like for people who aren't aware

689
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,200
the lineage is it's that uh ty you just

690
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,639
mentioned cross to the og kb and then

691
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,919
you got that hybrid and cross that to

692
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
the tk

693
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,720
how did this

694
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,278
whole process take place you know was it

695
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,798
over a few years was each step just

696
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,119
obvious like you know explain the

697
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,599
genesis of it for us

698
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,558
okay i started the chocolate cherry

699
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,399
uh

700
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,319
it was before my daughter was born my

701
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
time my time frames are never great so

702
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,839
we'll say between

703
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,880
she'll be eight now so that's over eight

704
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,959
years ago

705
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,278
and uh so that's when i started with the

706
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
chocolate cherry and after i made

707
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,319
chocolate cherry i actually was going

708
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,679
through it and finding females i wasn't

709
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,158
really looking for a male and

710
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,120
then i started working with my brother

711
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,000
had given me these lavender cross seeds

712
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,319
and i was going through a ton of colon

713
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,079
issues the cancer in my colon and other

714
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,678
random things

715
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,199
so the lavender was really really

716
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,000
helping me so i started working with

717
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,038
that boy and my chocolate cherry

718
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,359
uh

719
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,640
males were just put on the back burner

720
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,798
and

721
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,880
i started working with uh the lavender

722
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,720
and tripoli wicked i hit the chocolate

723
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,720
cherry with it and i hit a towel with it

724
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,200
and things along that line

725
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,759
but i ended up going back to the

726
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
chocolate cherry and finding a smell

727
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,599
that was

728
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,278
really thai dominant and had that cherry

729
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,719
smell instead of the chocolate smell

730
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,880
they actually had a cherry smell in the

731
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
stem rub

732
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,840
the mom

733
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,799
tasted like chocolates and cherries

734
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,959
that's why

735
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,278
all of that it tastes like chocolates

736
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,240
and cherries which was amazing i fell

737
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,400
from that and hit triangle i became

738
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,558
obsessed with triangle as an og it was

739
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,880
just like the perfect og for me it grew

740
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,639
great i got it to yield it was super

741
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,400
potent for me it always

742
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,240
helped me at the end of the night to

743
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,480
come out of my thoughts and bring me

744
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,400
down because i used to be really high

745
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,640
strung still high strung but i used to

746
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,559
be really really strong so when i made

747
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,919
that cross the

748
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,960
triangle female with the chocolate

749
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,520
cherry mill um

750
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,319
one of the first seeds i actually popped

751
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,400
came out a plant that smelled like

752
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,398
licorice it smelled like candy like red

753
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,440
vine candy

754
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:20,959
and um

755
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,960
i was uh

756
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,278
making some calls and i was like i swear

757
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,120
it smells just like red vine candy you

758
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,720
have to try it i was shown to a couple

759
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,879
of my my really

760
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,960
close friends locally and they were like

761
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,640
dudes it really smells and tastes like

762
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,278
red vine candy so i was like i'll just

763
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,880
call it red vine kush and that name

764
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:39,599
stuck with it forever

765
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
uh

766
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,480
so when

767
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,720
i didn't every

768
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,679
thing um so when i decided to work with

769
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,679
a mill out of the red fine seeds

770
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,759
the best way for me to say it was it's a

771
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,399
red vine mail which

772
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,000
red vine was really in my eyes that

773
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,079
single female that i had found because

774
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,480
it smelled just like the candy but how

775
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,798
else could i really relay that message

776
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,038
to people that it was this by this like

777
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,960
this instead i was just thought it's my

778
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,599
red line mill and i took the red blind

779
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,640
mill to the og

780
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,959
and the very first seat i popped

781
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,278
was what ended up becoming known as

782
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,840
rainbow ssog because my daughter named

783
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,278
it she was huge in my little ponies and

784
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,959
that's how all that whole thing

785
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:23,919
snowballed into

786
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,720
it

787
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,120
all the ponies and on the seed packaging

788
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,558
and all the names and everything like

789
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,038
that was really

790
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,079
at the time of like five-year-old

791
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:35,519
uh

792
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,439
kids idea

793
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,200
so yeah

794
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,200
yeah awesome you banged out a few

795
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,880
answers for me i was gonna ask for the

796
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,480
people wondering why all your strains

797
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,399
are named after my little pony

798
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,558
the other thing i wanted to ask is you

799
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,239
use the tk and you kind of set it in

800
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,918
there you know you really liked it do

801
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,120
you think it's the best of all the ogs

802
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,880
and more importantly do you think it's

803
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,119
the original or is something else the

804
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,200
original in your mind

805
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,558
the tk for me

806
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,798
i i truly believe that so much

807
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,480
california

808
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,079
flowers were going back east and things

809
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,558
like that that a lot of seeds were being

810
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,639
popped from backseats

811
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,278
and whether it came from back seats or

812
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,240
not it's beyond me

813
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:25,200
but i had ogs like tk in california and

814
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,200
that's why i loved it it reminded me so

815
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
much of these green strains that we were

816
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,038
getting

817
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,159
out of san diego and we had a strain

818
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,759
that we called uh san diego

819
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,760
i think it was san diego something i

820
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,839
can't remember the name of it um it was

821
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,119
it was just referred to as that really

822
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,558
good pot in

823
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,278
san diego

824
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,000
and

825
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:49,278
so that's i could never acquire that it

826
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,679
was forever before i got a cut back of

827
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,159
what we call the san diego

828
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,519
cut and now it it's the san diego og

829
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,000
later and it reminds me so much of tk

830
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,480
well i end up getting tk reminding me

831
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,798
completely of the san diego

832
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,120
plant and now i have the san diego plant

833
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,720
and they are a lot of light they have

834
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,639
some unique differences

835
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,399
but they're very very small unique

836
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,399
differences and they could be because

837
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,558
they've been in completely two different

838
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,359
environments for so long but they've

839
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,038
just evolved over time and that's why i

840
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,038
was obsessed with the tk for so long

841
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,879
because i had this flower

842
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,879
and it was coming through

843
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,399
quite often and i was smoking on it for

844
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,720
like a year straight

845
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,839
and i could never get a cut of it but

846
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,159
when i seen tk i was like holy [ __ ]

847
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,879
that reminds me spot spot-on of the san

848
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,200
diego flower

849
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,840
yeah okay so yeah it's hitting back home

850
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,679
from when you're younger

851
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,599
exactly

852
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,798
so for people who have kind of taken a

853
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,959
glance at

854
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,480
the current range most notably within

855
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,319
the rainbow offering

856
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,558
we can see that a lot of the mothers

857
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,839
you've chosen to pair with it outside of

858
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,480
some of your own creations are things

859
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,480
like the docudo gelato

860
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,120
skittles things like that do you think

861
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,360
that rainbow itself pairs well with

862
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,479
these other kind of i just broadly

863
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,079
speaking i guess you said that you like

864
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,000
the dessert type of strains do you think

865
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,000
it pairs well with that like going like

866
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,919
keeping sweet cookie things to sweet

867
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,200
cookie things or what do you think it

868
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,600
crosses really well to yourself

869
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,319
the the male from that line that i chose

870
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,959
is extremely dominant like everything

871
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,519
was looking rainbow like and that

872
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,759
chocolate smell and flavor is really

873
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,120
pushing into everything even the

874
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:36,960
skittles like it's hard to find

875
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,119
a plant and that cross that smells like

876
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,200
skittles everything is like chocolate

877
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,839
foam chocolate fun fun fun chocolate

878
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,399
funk uh so

879
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:49,839
they hit anything with the rainbow mail

880
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:53,119
that i chose and it's going to push

881
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:56,079
what i want i it's true so it's kind of

882
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,079
like downplaying some of my crosses um

883
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,398
that's i'm saying that the mail will

884
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,480
overpower everything but with each

885
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,199
female there are some variances whether

886
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,480
it's structure or yields or

887
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,080
you will find different smells with

888
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
different females

889
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,079
and

890
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,600
i ran a lot of these plants and these

891
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,038
are some of the ones i actually really

892
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,558
liked um

893
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:21,679
the skittles one i'm surprised that it

894
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,839
has been so good i was surprised when i

895
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,840
first ran them all outdoors i usually do

896
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,558
all my testing my initial testing and

897
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,959
in

898
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,119
large groups um that way i can do a mass

899
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,000
test under pretty good conditions

900
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,918
because

901
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,079
we have fluctuations here where i live i

902
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,240
mean it gets up to 112 115

903
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,798
fahrenheit and it can bottom down into

904
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,079
the 40s at night so it would put them

905
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,879
through a lot of stress

906
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,398
so

907
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,080
when i was going through my initial

908
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,359
testing and i ran

909
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,240
uh 20-ish of everything and

910
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,359
the

911
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,519
skittles were coming out absolutely

912
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,079
phenomenal so there was no way i

913
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,839
couldn't produce or put them out the

914
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,960
middle breath to me was

915
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:09,759
more along the lines of grabbing the ogb

916
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,840
from it and the og kb from rainbow and

917
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,440
seeing what i could do on that end

918
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,480
and then the same with the dosey though

919
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,080
it has the ogkb rainbow has the ogkb and

920
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,720
i wanted to see what those two would

921
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,639
play together plus i hit ogkb with

922
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,679
rainbow as well so you can kind of see

923
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,640
what i was trying to do with that

924
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,200
grouping to see where i could go

925
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,919
later down the line i was like will i

926
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,798
take that rainbow by dosi dope back to a

927
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,840
docido or back to the rainbow with mills

928
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,240
if i ever chose to

929
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,480
um easy one that was sort of like back

930
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,278
crossing the red line for me

931
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,640
i did the chocolate cherry as well um i

932
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,278
never really

933
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,399
that one's really interesting um because

934
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,240
it's so tight dominant it's not for

935
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,158
most growers

936
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,720
i'm getting plants that were taking you

937
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,399
know four months to finish

938
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,278
and a lot of people don't really care

939
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:02,798
for that

940
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,720
yeah um

941
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,119
and then i did some with the

942
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,358
with the the gold strain the acapulco

943
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,960
gold i can't release that one because

944
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,440
the person who gave me that cut asked me

945
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,199
not to release it and that i won't

946
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
and i did a panama

947
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,480
cross with it that i won't release

948
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,358
because once again the same person who

949
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,639
gave me the gold cut asked me told me i

950
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,719
could work with it but asked me not to

951
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,878
release them because that's they're his

952
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,118
babies and he's an older guy and

953
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,239
he'll pass them on to me when he's ready

954
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,039
uh to

955
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,638
do

956
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,960
what i what i really would like to do

957
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,559
and let people have some real old-school

958
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,760
genetics

959
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,000
but yeah

960
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,000
i just think a lot of those crosses

961
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,199
really were that that's what the market

962
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,878
was hungry for they like those plants

963
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,000
they like the gelatos and they like the

964
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:52,799
cookies those things but so i wanted to

965
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,398
give people what they wanted but

966
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,079
i wanted to do it with the rainbow

967
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,679
because the rainbow really is a unique

968
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,119
planet and it kind of overtakes

969
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,838
everything so you can still have your

970
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,240
name with the gelato but it'll have my

971
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:07,920
my footprint my stamp on there with the

972
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,598
rainbow pushing it to a different level

973
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,079
yeah good answer

974
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,480
so just given your uh you know

975
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,599
experience and history with all of these

976
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,519
various cuts we've just kind of

977
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,119
mentioned out of all the kind of dessert

978
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,800
cuts what's your favorite one and more

979
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,800
importantly what's the most overrated

980
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,599
one

981
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,640
right now i got a cup of asa e and

982
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:33,519
surprisingly it is special and unique

983
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,559
the fl flavor the terpene profile is

984
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,599
this

985
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,159
raspberry blueberry creamy

986
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,400
thing i it's i've just barely grown it

987
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,960
for the first time and

988
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,720
i gotta say i'm impressed like

989
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,679
i haven't been impressed with any of the

990
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,838
cookies truly everything is crazy like i

991
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,679
was like whoa whoever made this

992
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,320
they they took the flavor down to a

993
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,159
different level

994
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,079
i also really like animal cookies

995
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,838
because it breeds well like i i don't

996
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,400
know why my uncle i have an uncle who's

997
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,719
on hospice right now and i would grow

998
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,240
animal cookies a lot and it's my dad's

999
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,159
brother and

1000
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,159
i would grow animal cookies specifically

1001
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,559
for him he called them animal crackers

1002
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,319
and he would send my hand over to the

1003
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:19,519
house and be all he called me bubba

1004
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,200
that's why i use bubble all the time

1005
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,280
i've been called bubba my whole life

1006
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,358
brother and he would tell me ask bubba

1007
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,920
if he got any more of those girl scout

1008
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,000
animal crackers like the animal crackers

1009
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,000
the cookies he would just stumble on the

1010
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,679
words what the name was it was something

1011
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,239
new every time

1012
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,639
so he called at these names something

1013
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,039
different every time but he absolutely

1014
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:43,598
loved it out of every strain i grew he

1015
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,358
never he hasn't got a smoke rainbow

1016
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,320
because he's been sick for a few years

1017
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,000
um

1018
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,760
and um he's had some

1019
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
rainbow concentrates

1020
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,440
and i make a lot of rosin and i turn

1021
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,880
into coconut oil so i can give it to him

1022
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
that way

1023
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,640
but

1024
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,119
for

1025
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,279
all the plants that he had like

1026
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,920
something about the animal cookies was

1027
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,599
crazy for him that he loved so that was

1028
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,599
really special to me

1029
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,838
the past few years now the one that's

1030
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,720
the most overrated

1031
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,880
um

1032
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,679
uh

1033
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
now

1034
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,679
there's so many gelato cuts

1035
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,119
floating around and i went through

1036
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,639
probably seven or eight that were

1037
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,079
terrible that were

1038
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,759
i mean i don't even know why people

1039
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,119
would have grown them and then mothered

1040
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,960
them and then kept them in clone form to

1041
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,400
pass them out they were they weren't

1042
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,440
they shouldn't have never been kept or

1043
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,039
grown um so those ones were pretty

1044
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,800
brutal some of the gelatos are just

1045
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,719
pretty brutal the one i found at least

1046
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,280
looks like og kb so

1047
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,598
it doesn't have the gelato nose that

1048
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,480
everyone talks about but i would say

1049
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,200
that would probably be the one that's

1050
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,800
not the best what was the name of the

1051
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,639
the first train you said the raspberry

1052
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,400
and blueberry one

1053
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,920
oh acai

1054
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,838
okay no

1055
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,800
we we did get the name i just was like

1056
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,799
what the [ __ ] was that

1057
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,880
what is he speaking

1058
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,560
yeah i thought the audio cut out i was

1059
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,280
like he said something but all i heard

1060
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:14,078
was like a and e or something

1061
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,000
i i might be pronouncing this wrong it's

1062
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,280
a c a i and it i i realize that it's a

1063
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
berry

1064
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,040
um i wanna say like the

1065
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,639
south america um i know they have a

1066
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,320
drink flavored i think they're assai asy

1067
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,639
something along those lines yeah i've

1068
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,760
heard of that one my bad there we go

1069
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,358
okay

1070
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,359
cool okay

1071
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:39,199
that yeah i think i may have even seen a

1072
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,039
photo or two or just something along

1073
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,799
those lines on instagram if that one it

1074
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,279
seems like that's uh

1075
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,200
might those guys from

1076
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,079
compound genetics or whatever might be

1077
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,078
playing with that i think

1078
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,639
who knows pinkie pie is collab between

1079
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,239
you and matt which i thought kind of

1080
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,159
flew under the radar a bit as far as i

1081
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,559
could tell i don't know um but what was

1082
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,879
interesting was that

1083
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,960
it's it's kind of like it's the cookie

1084
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,720
berry diesel across to the rainbow

1085
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,480
obviously probably going to be really

1086
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,519
good but the question for me was do you

1087
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,119
plan to do any more collabs

1088
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,679
yeah we do i met with him today um

1089
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,599
he's a he's an amazing guy but i met up

1090
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,799
with them today we talked

1091
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,760
it's on

1092
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,240
a ton of content about what we're doing

1093
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,079
um we're doing this whole

1094
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,000
this wouldn't be considered like what

1095
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,680
most people would consider a co-op lab

1096
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,400
but we're working this huge bubble gum

1097
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,078
line thing right now um

1098
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,800
and we're trying to really really

1099
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,720
isolate those turmeric beans

1100
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,640
and make sure the seeds taste like so

1101
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,078
like if you get a pack of the bubble gum

1102
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,118
seeds you're going to get pink bubble

1103
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,960
gum knots oh it tastes sweet but that's

1104
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,960
that's not really a collab per se um

1105
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,639
i'm getting his uh

1106
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,240
riot berry

1107
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:59,838
og and we're doing it with a rainbow and

1108
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,199
that one's going to be really rad and

1109
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:05,440
then he did some work with chocolate

1110
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,439
and um so we're going to do my chocolate

1111
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,480
uh chocolate rainbow mill

1112
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,800
with uh

1113
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,199
his chocolate females but then he gave

1114
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,760
me his chocolate thai mail and we're

1115
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:18,799
gonna take that to my chocolate

1116
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,680
super chocolate rainbow female um

1117
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,440
so

1118
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,039
those are some of the collabs that we

1119
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,960
spoke of today and we have a few other

1120
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,480
things that uh

1121
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,920
it was funny when we were talking he was

1122
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,880
like you know what let's try not to say

1123
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,838
these out to people yet um for for

1124
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
reasons

1125
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,119
that he has and i was all i you know so

1126
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,039
i'm good with that

1127
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,920
yeah okay

1128
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,759
um

1129
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,760
so i guess you know it's interesting a

1130
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,200
lot of our fans they love the polarizing

1131
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
nature of matt how did you first meet

1132
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,960
him and how did you kind of i think you

1133
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,880
even said it to me in person you kind of

1134
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,800
attribute a bit of the success of

1135
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,880
rainbow to in terms of like matt helping

1136
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,480
you to kind of um

1137
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,680
how shall we say like promote it to the

1138
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
public a bit more because there's a lot

1139
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:00,078
of stuff which goes under the radar

1140
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,838
because you know the public just don't

1141
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,640
know about it how did how did you meet

1142
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,639
man how that all come about

1143
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,440
it it's actually funny i have a friend

talking every day and then we started

1164
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,239
talking about genetics and then i would

1165
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,000
show him this vast array of crazy [ __ ]

1166
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,519
i've made over the years and he showed

1167
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,318
me all the [ __ ] he'd been making over

1168
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,400
the years and he'd be like hey how come

1169
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,480
you don't sell seeds you have an amazing

1170
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,760
skill you have amazing growing skill how

1171
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,679
can we don't sell seeds

1172
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,319
i just i don't like

1173
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,399
it's never been something i wanted to do

1174
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,800
i made these for myself i made these to

1175
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,039
find things for me and he was but people

1176
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,960
it wasn't really about money and i'll

1177
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,639
explain this in a second

1178
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,480
it was never about money for matt he was

1179
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,719
all people

1180
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,400
would want to see these people

1181
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,799
people would love to see this people

1182
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,280
want to see your work and he after he

1183
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,720
went over two years you can ask him he

1184
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,720
asked me for over two years to sell

1185
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,239
seats and i finally agreed with the

1186
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:45,519
rainbow the rainbow

1187
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,358
is so special i was all like dude i just

1188
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,519
remember telling them on desert man

1189
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,279
i really think that maybe we should put

1190
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:54,960
it out there people are getting to smoke

1191
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,839
it and they're all this is like 1990s on

1192
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,880
you know

1193
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,519
on

1194
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,119
big big big things like it's all this

1195
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,318
reminds me of something this is so

1196
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,160
nostalgic for me it's

1197
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,759
like they couldn't put their finger on

1198
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,239
it so that was the

1199
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,560
what i was hearing so i talked to him he

1200
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,199
he talked me into it he's all like let

1201
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,318
me put these let me sell these seats for

1202
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,759
you

1203
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,199
and let me help you with this and then

1204
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,280
it's okay and he was all i don't want

1205
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,759
any money

1206
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,519
he didn't want a dollar he didn't take a

1207
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,839
dollar nothing

1208
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,358
he was all i'll put him on my website

1209
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,519
we'll put him up

1210
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,039
i'm going to talk about it because i

1211
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,119
gave him

1212
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,239
they helped him so much and they helped

1213
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,200
his uh

1214
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,078
his

1215
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,759
significant other so much with their

1216
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,839
anxieties and their

1217
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,040
their their feelings that they

1218
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:49,759
were having and she will have some

1219
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,838
medical issues and they they helped her

1220
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,920
with those things and that's why i saw i

1221
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,078
made this for myself because of my own

1222
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,079
health issues so

1223
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,119
that's really how our friendship started

1224
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,760
it was over talking about genetics and a

1225
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,400
cookie's clone that he was trying to

1226
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,400
reacquire that's truly it

1227
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,240
that's an awesome story

1228
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,480
so something you just touched on which

1229
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,719
i'd love to delve more into is

1230
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,400
kind of the aspect of medicinal value

1231
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,719
within breeding is this something which

1232
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,400
to you is just like it's kind of cool if

1233
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,879
it's there but it's not a specific goal

1234
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,599
or you always kind of medically minded

1235
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,599
in that regard

1236
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,000
as far as a breather

1237
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,200
i'm always going to breed for myself

1238
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,199
first in my real passion projects

1239
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,559
they really are pushing

1240
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,559
the medical parts i remember being on i

1241
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:41,920
didn't go to forums uh mad was always

1242
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,679
trying to get me to go on forums and i

1243
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,960
was like man i'm always out in the field

1244
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,799
i don't really have time for the forums

1245
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,400
i'm always growing up i'm always growing

1246
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,119
i'd go on there a few times and i would

1247
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,440
explain to people about how this strain

1248
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,880
helped with this or i couldn't

1249
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,318
live without the strain and people would

1250
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,519
think it was some sort of joke they're

1251
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:02,079
all oh yeah i was at miracle week

1252
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,000
i was oh you called it weed so you

1253
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,079
probably don't really love the planet

1254
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,119
like i do um so i would

1255
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,160
push that medical benefit as far as i

1256
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,318
possibly can and it goes back to the

1257
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,000
the chocolate cherry making me feel like

1258
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,519
i was on the mushrooms yeah i didn't

1259
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,318
like that feeling but i could feel the

1260
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,880
other parts of it and how important they

1261
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,639
would be to help relax my body and help

1262
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,039
calm me and

1263
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,199
i get a lot of pain sometimes and i need

1264
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,279
things that are extremely strong and i

1265
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,159
don't like to be extremely

1266
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,960
medic

1267
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,759
or

1268
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,000
high and so i have to find that that

1269
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,560
area that gray area where

1270
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,559
my head is okay but my body's completely

1271
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,279
blown out where it's just like relaxed

1272
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,559
beyond all belief so yes

1273
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,760
the medical part is priority a one for

1274
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,719
me but i love breeding yeah i love

1275
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,720
making

1276
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,799
crosses with genetics

1277
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,480
for other people as well so

1278
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,039
if there's some strains that i really

1279
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,079
want to work with whether they have any

1280
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,000
kind of

1281
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,880
benefit or not

1282
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,358
i would work with them if i felt like

1283
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,519
these two planets together would make

1284
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:17,519
magic so i would still work with things

1285
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,519
regardless of whether they're

1286
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,000
medical or not

1287
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,440
but i personally for my own breeding i

1288
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,318
want them to have

1289
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,318
certain aspects

1290
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:33,920
so recently we saw the uh rainbow ssogs

1291
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,599
f2s go to auction obviously kind of one

1292
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,039
of your hallmark strains at this point

1293
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,119
you've got to be pretty stoked that you

1294
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:40,559
know cracked like the 2k mark because

1295
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,640
you know i mean the proof's in the

1296
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,559
pudding right the demands there how do

1297
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,159
you feel though about

1298
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,159
the fact that

1299
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,719
in some ways you it could be the next

1300
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,159
star fighter you know like do you

1301
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,279
how would you feel if someone starts a

1302
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,078
company off that pack type of thing

1303
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,640
i there was a battle it was a battle

1304
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,039
that i had before i even released the f2

1305
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,239
um it was a battle i had

1306
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,279
on

1307
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,358
all my crosses like well what if

1308
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,960
somebody took my work and what if

1309
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:11,759
somebody made this or what if they made

1310
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,159
that

1311
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,400
well i should be really proud if

1312
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:19,199
somebody finds something so

1313
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,079
special that they could get that type of

1314
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,078
a plan out of and make an entire company

1315
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,599
and thrive

1316
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,160
with it and

1317
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,920
make a living for them and their family

1318
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,639
how special should i feel

1319
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,559
i mean if something i did affected

1320
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,480
somebody else that affects their family

1321
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,280
that affects somebody else that would

1322
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,000
feel amazing i would have zero jealously

1323
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,720
zero anything so

1324
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,119
of course i hope the person who bought

1325
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:49,598
the f2s finds something absolutely

1326
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,318
stunning i hope they do some amazing

1327
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,160
stuff with it um there was a purpose why

1328
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,119
i auctioned that i had somebody who

1329
00:47:54,159 --> 00:48:00,719
needed something so i auctioned that

1330
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:04,318
off i did two auctions and i gave them

1331
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,558
half of everything so they could uh

1332
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,960
pay some pay some bills

1333
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,119
and so i thought in my mind those two

1334
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,440
crosses that i auctioned were the ones

1335
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,720
that would bring in the most and lord

1336
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,838
that thing brought like two thousand

1337
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:20,318
dollars i was i was tickled i was blown

1338
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:22,558
away i couldn't believe it so it was it

1339
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:24,000
was really really really awesome i was

1340
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,920
proud

1341
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,318
for sure for sure i mean testament to

1342
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,318
the quality of the work right

1343
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:32,318
yeah yeah i put a lot of time

1344
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:34,639
rainbow and i'm proud to see that people

1345
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,558
will see it and and truly put their

1346
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:37,598
faith behind my work

1347
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,640
so

1348
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,480
on a kind of you know that vein what is

1349
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,000
the next kind of strain you want to

1350
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,920
incorporate into a breeding pool that

1351
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,280
you haven't done so and i guess as an

1352
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,720
extension of that

1353
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,760
what do you think will be the next big

1354
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:54,879
thing to kind of take the scene

1355
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,040
so the my next work is uh

1356
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,280
i'm doing rainbow again but i'm going

1357
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,480
i'm going to go into a little different

1358
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,519
direction with

1359
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,280
it

1360
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,519
i'm going to isolate the chocolate

1361
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,160
fennels and the chocolate milk and i'm

1362
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,920
going to push the chocolate terpenes

1363
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,039
into seed form

1364
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,480
in rainbow f2 chocolate phenol with the

1365
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,119
with the milk so i'm going to make some

1366
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,199
f2s of that rainbow line and that's

1367
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,079
super chocolate and then i'm going to do

1368
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:24,159
the f3 with the with the the original

1369
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,920
rainbow and then

1370
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:27,679
some more back crossing so that's where

1371
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,000
i'm headed right now on my little

1372
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:33,919
personal project that's that's building

1373
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
i don't know the scene where it's going

1374
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,159
to go i keep thinking that we're going

1375
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,280
to leave the cookie

1376
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,358
and um

1377
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,200
that people will stop working with it

1378
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,639
and there will be something else

1379
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,118
but i think

1380
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,639
how deep that

1381
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,240
plant

1382
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,519
got into

1383
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,118
modern genetics i don't know if we could

1384
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,838
ever truly

1385
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,039
get away from it

1386
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,759
everything has

1387
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,039
that that look to it now and everything

1388
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,200
has

1389
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,679
either a cookie name or a dessert name

1390
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,598
or something along those lines so it'd

1391
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,639
be like erasing

1392
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,720
our modern history it just i don't think

1393
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,519
it's going to happen

1394
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,959
i'm hoping that guys start resetting

1395
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,800
start looking at it different and it

1396
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,720
comes down to the breeders to start

1397
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,039
working with some old hazel's and trying

1398
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,118
to find some old skunks and not the

1399
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,358
liars don't like say that you're working

1400
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,079
with a haze or a skunk and have it be

1401
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:34,480
some weird indica looking like really

1402
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,760
really do your work

1403
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,358
pop seeds find that special plant and go

1404
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,400
from there and work it because it would

1405
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:44,078
be nice

1406
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,680
to have that old school feel again but

1407
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,920
you know you can put a modern twist on

1408
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,078
it and everything like that but

1409
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,838
i'm hoping i'm seeing it so much right

1410
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,760
now uh

1411
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:54,920
guys claiming that they're you know

1412
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,440
using a

1413
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,639
1960s skunk or

1414
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,280
these all these hazes uh

1415
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:06,558
colombian blacks and things along that

1416
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,160
line and it's hard for me to believe

1417
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,160
because i haven't seen those strings in

1418
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,519
a very very long time and i've never

1419
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:16,000
seen a skunk from the 60s um but i'm

1420
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,159
hoping that there are some of those

1421
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
treasure trails to still be opened and

1422
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,440
people can still come out i've been

1423
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,079
meeting some

1424
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,318
people lately i've been helping a lot of

1425
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,079
older people i mean friday night before

1426
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:30,480
i took my wife out to dinner i stopped

1427
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,079
at a vietnam vets house and gave him

1428
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,679
some medicine to

1429
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,160
so he could get through

1430
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:39,039
me up and said he didn't have anything

1431
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,039
and he was close it's a family friend so

1432
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,440
i drove him over a bunch of stuff and

1433
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:47,199
he has seeds from when he went to

1434
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,280
vietnam and he's offered me these seeds

1435
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,919
and i have no clue what they are

1436
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,400
but to have that offer there there is

1437
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,119
other seats out there i've been trying

1438
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,800
to pop some of my father's old michoacan

1439
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,880
that i found in the envelope from when

1440
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,920
he was in prison

1441
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,760
um

1442
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,400
with his little prisoner id and his

1443
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,200
return address and everything

1444
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,680
and these seats were in there yeah and i

1445
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,598
found them in my garage i guess they

1446
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,159
followed us through like three moves and

1447
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,480
then i found them and i've tried to pop

1448
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,558
there was 27 28

1449
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,480
and i have failed miserably over and

1450
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,839
over so the last six

1451
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,159
i've kept and i'm hoping that one day

1452
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:30,639
somebody can extract some dna out of it

1453
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:34,879
or something so i can see these plants

1454
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,879
so that's where i hope our industry goes

1455
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,680
okay

1456
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,479
and so

1457
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,318
would you ever consider doing what might

1458
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,559
be considered kind of like a consumer

1459
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,159
demands train like for example if if

1460
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,960
there was enough demand for you to do

1461
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:47,759
like

1462
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,838
a

1463
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,839
gorilla glue rainbow hybrid would you do

1464
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,960
it to meet that demand or is it very

1465
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,558
much like

1466
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,440
you have to want the cross to happen on

1467
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,440
a personal note

1468
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,800
you know

1469
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,838
i will meet the demands i i truly will i

1470
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,318
i did

1471
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,679
a lot of those in the last crosses like

1472
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:09,279
i was saying so many people wanted

1473
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,919
gelato i truly didn't want to work with

1474
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,680
the gelato i'm happy i did it came out

1475
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,318
pure chocolate and coffee

1476
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:19,598
i actually did a gorilla glue cross with

1477
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:22,400
rainbow but i did it for a local friend

1478
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,559
and i gifted him a lot of those seeds i

1479
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,400
didn't release those seeds though

1480
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,640
i actually have a ton of them that i

1481
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,079
didn't release to other people locally

1482
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:34,558
or friends from here there asked for i

1483
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,960
made the crosses for them specifically

1484
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,400
and gifted them some

1485
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,199
so i'm open

1486
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:45,039
to make anything as long as

1487
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:47,118
i don't hate the plant like or something

1488
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,558
it's too strong of a word i apologize i

1489
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,640
shouldn't use that as long as i don't

1490
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,920
dislike the plant or as long as the

1491
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,558
plant doesn't have some sort of

1492
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,960
reputation or as long as a plant doesn't

1493
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,960
have like don't share this plant with

1494
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,720
anybody and

1495
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,039
don't do this with the plant and those

1496
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,558
kinds of plants i i tried to steer clear

1497
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,639
from because i don't want to rub anybody

1498
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,400
wrong by working with something that i

1499
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:12,159
shouldn't have worked with or things

1500
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,720
along that nature but i am willing to

1501
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,960
work with anything i see that i find has

1502
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:19,039
potential or specialness or you ain't a

1503
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,400
uniqueness

1504
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:24,480
yeah for sure so what do you think

1505
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,160
the next source of uniqueness will come

1506
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,880
from and the reason why i ask this is

1507
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,519
because increasingly i see this kind of

1508
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,838
trend where some of the old-school

1509
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:35,519
genetics that are widely regarded as

1510
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,440
really unique you know the colombians

1511
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,119
the thais things like that are being

1512
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,519
caught are being incorporated into the

1513
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,200
modern genetics and the perfect example

1514
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,039
is both the rainbow ss which has

1515
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,558
obviously got some tyre or even if you

1516
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,960
look at another trending strain at the

1517
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,960
moment mac by capulet which has the land

1518
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,760
race colombian in it both of these

1519
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,960
strains were i mean just as a side note

1520
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,319
that i tried both of those at the

1521
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,760
emerald cup and those were the two i

1522
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:00,318
actually enjoyed the most and i kind of

1523
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,280
thought this could be kind of jazzing up

1524
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:05,039
the uh what's regarded as the stale poly

1525
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,880
hybrid do you think that is like a

1526
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,798
reasonable formula going ahead in the

1527
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,640
future like incorporating some of this

1528
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:11,679
old school stuff into the modern stuff

1529
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:15,838
and trying to

1530
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,838
yeah just um spice everything up

1531
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,359
um i believe capulet had corrected

1532
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,000
himself and said the mac doesn't have

1533
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:26,719
colombian in it

1534
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,358
it's an alien orange cookie cross um

1535
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:31,358
but what i would alluding to what i was

1536
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:34,239
saying earlier um

1537
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:36,159
i think we're going to start seeing in

1538
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,719
this more

1539
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,639
we're going to start seeing this

1540
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,239
come out more where guys are finding the

1541
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,719
older strains and putting them with the

1542
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:48,399
new restraints and kind of resetting the

1543
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:49,919
plant you still get some of the before

1544
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,639
it was watering down

1545
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,798
effects but some of the look

1546
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,199
of the new stuff but maybe it improves

1547
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,039
the yield because some of these cookies

1548
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,118
that have rabbit turd buds and you're

1549
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,519
getting a pound of light or something

1550
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,318
like people just don't want to do

1551
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:06,480
that

1552
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,318
people the electricity costs are

1553
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,960
skyrocketing and

1554
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,880
production cost of skyrocketing so you

1555
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,240
do need to get

1556
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,160
some yield and

1557
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:18,239
looking back at older strains they

1558
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:21,118
yielded really well they were big they

1559
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:23,838
were aggressive they weren't susceptible

1560
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,559
to pm and the bugs didn't destroy them

1561
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:28,838
like they do now and things along that

1562
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,519
nature but no i

1563
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:34,400
where mac i could be speaking wrong on

1564
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:37,920
that um but like it was said that it had

1565
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,838
colombian in it rainbow is has

1566
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,079
and you're seeing a few other things

1567
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,440
that are people the good breeders or the

1568
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,359
the breeders i shouldn't even say good

1569
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,760
breeders breeders

1570
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:50,480
are saying like oh i'm working with this

1571
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,480
older ibo or i'm working with this land

1572
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,199
race type or i'm working with these

1573
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,480
genetics that are from thailand or from

1574
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,838
south america

1575
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,400
i would love to see a breeder

1576
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,719
pull the michoacan back out into work

1577
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,079
with that or pull the old gold strings

1578
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,759
out and work with that they were

1579
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,318
absolutely flawless and that's why it

1580
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,720
was important for me to try to get these

1581
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,639
metros to michoacans

1582
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,159
to come to life to rejuvenate but they

1583
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,920
went through so much it's going to be

1584
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:21,598
hard um some of them look like uh

1585
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,440
fossilized like they're actually glass

1586
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,480
on the inside right so it's going to be

1587
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,559
rough

1588
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,400
but that's i i do i i truly think that

1589
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,519
that's where we're gonna be headed

1590
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,599
because if you don't go and pull some of

1591
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,838
the old stuff back into it everything's

1592
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,000
gonna become like our table apples that

1593
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:39,039
have no flavor and they're just shiny

1594
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,199
it's pretty

1595
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:44,719
flavorless or flavorless fruit

1596
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:46,639
yeah okay

1597
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,078
that's that's cool to know about the mac

1598
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:50,879
thing i mean i wonder if he's going to

1599
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,359
change the name to mock

1600
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,400
nah just kidding but a question our

1601
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:58,480
listeners love for me to ask is when you

1602
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,000
are popping these old school seeds what

1603
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,639
are some of your tips to help getting

1604
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,639
them to work

1605
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:08,000
um

1606
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:10,318
so i don't go straight to the chemicals

1607
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,880
i'll try to do a scuffing first

1608
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,318
these new seed crackers are

1609
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,318
freaking awesome they have a little

1610
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:19,119
screw on them and it slowly tightens

1611
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,519
down on the seed so it just soars it

1612
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:24,880
starts to open the shell

1613
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:27,440
i also like to put them in high humidity

1614
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,119
if they've been dry so that way

1615
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,960
hopefully they can pull in some more of

1616
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,880
the moisture i

1617
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,880
personally put them through a cold cycle

1618
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,440
i'll either put them in the fridge or

1619
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,880
the freezer until they

1620
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,119
fully

1621
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,960
i'll bring them out and then act like

1622
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,280
spring is here i try to fool them as

1623
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,480
best as i can in worst case scenario

1624
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,400
i'll use the ga3 and

1625
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,760
take deal with the stretch and the

1626
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,559
craziness to just try to get it to

1627
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,559
come back to life

1628
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:01,039
and so

1629
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,358
i've actually only ever used the ga3

1630
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,440
once in an attempt to get some old tom

1631
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,199
hillstock to pop unfortunately didn't

1632
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,119
really work out for me but i went into

1633
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:11,039
it knowing like what you referenced that

1634
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,280
the uh the plants would be hard to kind

1635
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,279
of manage at first when you have done

1636
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,798
that what was the experience like

1637
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,240
growing those plants out were they like

1638
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:19,920
crazy stretchy and you just had to you

1639
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,000
know take a clone of a clone and then it

1640
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,838
kind of settled down or was it much less

1641
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,119
pronounced than that

1642
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,519
um

1643
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:30,240
everyone that i've actually used it on

1644
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:31,838
has been pretty wild they would

1645
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,639
fly right out of the gate they would

1646
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:37,599
stretch really really really fast um so

1647
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:39,118
one way i would do that is that i made

1648
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,318
these uh

1649
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,440
pvc

1650
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:45,119
and um i would fill it up with uh

1651
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,200
about halfway with her and then i would

1652
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,000
drop the seedling in there and i would

1653
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,798
put an led right above the tube and as

1654
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
the seed chased the light and elongated

1655
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,679
and got long i would bury it and stir

1656
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,199
up the stem because that's what it

1657
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:01,598
wanted to do was grow in the very

1658
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:04,480
elongated stem so i would just bury it

1659
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,880
in dirt as it went up and it would

1660
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,960
eventually slow down to the point where

1661
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,318
i could top it branch it take some

1662
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,440
clones root them and usually the clones

1663
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:17,519
were already okay once they got roots

1664
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,920
and you slowed them down the first

1665
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:23,679
generational clone off of that

1666
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,400
spas attack plant was it was okay

1667
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,279
yeah okay cool that's good to know

1668
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,440
so

1669
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,200
final question on the old seeds with all

1670
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,760
of this being said what's the oldest one

1671
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,359
you've been able to pop

1672
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,480
oh man um

1673
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,280
[Music]

1674
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,280
recently i popped some scentsy star

1675
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,519
from 95.

1676
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,359
um those that was a pretty good feat

1677
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,239
they were pretty white

1678
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,318
um

1679
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:51,199
and pretty beat up i popped some of my

1680
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:53,838
dad's stuff um at other times that i'm

1681
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:57,039
assuming we're from the 80s

1682
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,318
maybe early 90s all commercial stuff

1683
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,880
and

1684
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:03,119
other than that i've i've failed on some

1685
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:05,280
of the really old stuff a lot and it's

1686
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,720
driving me nuts

1687
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,720
so i'm

1688
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,199
thinking of other ways i'm hoping that

1689
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,039
we can get some of these seeds to be

1690
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,318
uh

1691
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,960
i don't know how they'll do it but i'm

1692
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,880
hearing of dna and pulling out sales

1693
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,720
from a plant and

1694
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,640
basically doing that

1695
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:26,318
what they're doing those lab clones now

1696
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:28,159
but with the dna from the seed link

1697
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:29,679
yeah that's interesting that stuff i

1698
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,118
haven't looked into it too much myself

1699
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:33,039
but i think it's probably cost

1700
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,318
prohibitive

1701
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,880
yeah

1702
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:38,880
this these are super important so i've

1703
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,960
been looking into it because

1704
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,880
i i really really really would like to

1705
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,159
see one

1706
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,440
it really is it's special to me you know

1707
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,639
yeah for sure

1708
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,000
so

1709
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,759
when you are

1710
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,199
popping some seeds

1711
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,880
how many do you like to pop at a time

1712
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:56,798
you know when you're doing a pheno hunt

1713
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:01,440
or just maybe even say testing australia

1714
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,440
what do you feel is a good number to do

1715
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,240
so if i'm

1716
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:08,798
pheno hunting for

1717
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,879
to check for stability

1718
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,559
um i like to do

1719
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,720
as many as possible

1720
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,720
um i think i did

1721
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,639
200-ish

1722
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,639
last summer and then

1723
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:23,199
followed that with my fall

1724
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:26,239
greenhouse i did another hundreds

1725
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:28,318
and then the next spring i did another

1726
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,078
50-100 and then i grew

1727
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:32,798
plenty on the inside of the house as

1728
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,400
well so stability you have to see a lot

1729
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:38,400
so you have to see a lot especially if

1730
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,639
you make a huge sense this is with 10 or

1731
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,639
15 different moms um now when i'm

1732
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,480
looking for a meal

1733
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:49,598
i like to do less where i'll do 10 to 15

1734
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,280
maybe even 20 seeds um i'll take my

1735
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,200
females i'll flower mouth of course i

1736
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,039
take clones off of them and then i look

1737
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:57,038
at the males and

1738
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,839
if i don't see anything i like

1739
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,760
a pop more if i see one that i like i'll

1740
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:04,798
keep them to the side and i'll pop

1741
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,280
another set of the 10 15 or 20 and i'll

1742
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:08,079
find another male from those if i like

1743
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,680
them

1744
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,760
and he goes and i'll usually do it one

1745
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,279
more time and then i'll narrow it down

1746
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,039
to those three males and i'll put them

1747
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:22,559
through their entire pace um

1748
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:24,000
and see which one i like as it goes

1749
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,680
yeah awesome

1750
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,920
at a time i don't like

1751
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:30,000
this yeah i don't like to see a ton

1752
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,639
because by the time i've looked at them

1753
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,318
all i'm getting irritated or i feel that

1754
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,920
maybe i'm looking

1755
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:39,599
too fast or i'm grinding through it so

1756
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,200
i want to see

1757
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,960
i'll pick the best small scale pick the

1758
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,558
best small scale pick the best and then

1759
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,760
isolate those three that i'm looking for

1760
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,039
to find that single plant

1761
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,240
yeah okay

1762
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:54,240
so in regards to the male selection you

1763
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:55,919
know you just went over a fair bit of it

1764
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,959
what are some of the things you like to

1765
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:01,440
do to help you select males

1766
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,599
this is a big one we get asked a lot but

1767
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,119
you know i think to be honest we've

1768
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,798
we've had enough guests talk about just

1769
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,400
you know generic like stem rubs and

1770
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,559
stuff so maybe let's make it a little

1771
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,160
more interesting do you like to put your

1772
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,920
males through the ringer give them like

1773
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:15,679
a good stress test and if so what do you

1774
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,440
do

1775
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:20,798
yeah the first thing i

1776
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,480
won't use the mail that flowers on

1777
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:23,759
um i have

1778
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,199
males that are

1779
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,079
over 10 years old

1780
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,679
and uh that constantly i keep almost

1781
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,318
every meal i've ever used

1782
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:35,279
um so that's one of my keys is to

1783
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:36,639
keep my meals he can't fly hour under 24

1784
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,160
hours like he has to be just like my

1785
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,759
girls where he can stay in there and

1786
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:43,038
then eventually i take a clone off of

1787
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,200
him and he gets mulched and the clone

1788
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:48,000
becomes the new dad for in case i ever

1789
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:49,919
want to work with him again um

1790
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,880
i like to look for structure

1791
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,880
of the plan i know everyone says that

1792
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,838
so i like to look at the the

1793
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,440
the leaf if i'm looking for a certain

1794
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,279
phenol that has a narrow leaf i'll look

1795
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,480
for that in the in the mail

1796
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,559
i'll look for my

1797
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,039
narrow leaves or things along that and

1798
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,960
then i always flour them out even if i'm

1799
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,799
not going to utilize his pollen i'll

1800
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,920
flower out my mouth just so i can see

1801
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,079
what

1802
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,318
his male flowers look like how long it

1803
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,119
takes him to drop pollen uh when does he

1804
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:18,798
stop

1805
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,798
dropping pollen when does his male

1806
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:23,599
flowers die

1807
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:26,239
the whole the whole from start to finish

1808
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,039
the his whole life and um i'll go from

1809
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:29,199
there

1810
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,000
i've actually flowered out that i didn't

1811
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:35,199
end up using because i didn't like how

1812
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,960
long it took them to flower or and then

1813
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:39,279
not drop enough pollen i've had males

1814
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,880
that had huge flowers and dropped so

1815
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,960
little pollen

1816
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,400
and i didn't use it

1817
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,920
did it really matter i don't know

1818
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,838
because i didn't use them but it was

1819
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,680
something i didn't like seeing a male

1820
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,239
plant with thousand freaking little

1821
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,558
flowers and no pollen was coming out why

1822
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,879
you know what's wrong with him so

1823
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,880
those are all things i look for

1824
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,160
yeah that's that's a good answer out of

1825
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,920
uh curiosity what do you think

1826
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,598
it correlates to inner male if you've

1827
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,200
got a male that takes quite a while to

1828
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,119
drop pollen do you know what that

1829
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:10,719
correlates to in regards to like you

1830
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,720
know that's like a bad sign because it

1831
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:14,000
means the offspring will show blur

1832
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,199
traits or do you think it's just like

1833
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,239
it's just one of those things in general

1834
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:17,439
where you're like look i don't i don't

1835
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:20,159
know but just you don't want that it's

1836
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,679
not good i can tell

1837
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,239
i actually think it would just show that

1838
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:26,078
it would be a slower flowering plant yep

1839
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:28,239
so like it would take longer to get

1840
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,760
going in the flower and probably longer

1841
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,239
to finish and flower

1842
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,079
to keep my plants in that unless i'm

1843
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,399
working my sativa lines if i'm working

1844
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,318
my hybrids i like to keep them in the 60

1845
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,798
to 70

1846
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:43,199
day frame um a lot of people don't want

1847
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,119
to work a hybrid you know three months

1848
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,838
and things like that so but that's one

1849
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,358
thing i i do notice that i like a plant

1850
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,798
to come out of the gay show me what

1851
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:53,440
she's gonna do

1852
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:55,759
uh not be finicky throughout and

1853
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,639
all those kind of things so if i notice

1854
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,880
that the

1855
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:01,118
the mom isn't finicky at the beginning

1856
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,599
of her flower she goes through her stage

1857
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,880
fast she gets to her her flowering stage

1858
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,798
quickly and she

1859
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,358
goes from start to finish without a lot

1860
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:11,519
of issues i can kind of see it from the

1861
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,038
mail i feed my mails the same as well

1862
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:15,599
when they're going through flour i

1863
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:18,400
feed feeding my flowering routine and if

1864
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,440
he doesn't like it and he he is doesn't

1865
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,680
like the food he shows burnt tips or if

1866
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,358
he takes a lot longer to progress or

1867
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,719
things like that it's just

1868
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:30,798
it's not a perfect plant for in my eyes

1869
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:31,679
it's not something that i would

1870
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:33,440
think

1871
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:35,199
would pass on well

1872
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,760
whether i'm right or wrong in that it's

1873
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,279
really really difficult for me to say

1874
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,680
because how

1875
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,960
do i know what those traits pass along

1876
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:46,639
as

1877
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:49,519
but in my my brain it tells me okay

1878
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:51,679
he's slow to start dropping pollen or

1879
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:55,199
he's really fast to start dropping

1880
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,798
pollen um i like the perfect plant so i

1881
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:58,318
kind of like it to start dropping this

1882
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,318
pollen you know through the whole cycle

1883
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,318
he starts building his flowers and his

1884
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,480
flowers grow and the plant stretches out

1885
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:08,960
and it opens up and then pollen starts

1886
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,960
to come out all around the same time

1887
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:11,920
so

1888
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,000
along that same

1889
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,319
kind of school of thought

1890
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,238
what do you think about the distinction

1891
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,520
because this is the one i wanted to ask

1892
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,959
what do you think about the distinction

1893
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,799
because you reference the you you don't

1894
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,039
want the mail to flower under 24 hour

1895
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,719
lights totally agree what about though

1896
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:27,920
if it gets extremely root bound because

1897
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,920
i've noticed

1898
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,600
sometimes males will flower because

1899
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,920
they're root bound others they'll just

1900
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,920
do it under 24 hour light regardless and

1901
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,440
i thought do you want to actually do you

1902
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,960
want to make the distinction or not

1903
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,559
because maybe

1904
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,239
what i'm kind of getting at is maybe a

1905
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,880
plant that flowers because it's root

1906
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,119
bound is not as detrimental as say one

1907
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,239
that flowers because it's under 24 7.

1908
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:50,079
would you agree with that or do you

1909
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,919
think like nah no matter what the

1910
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:53,439
reasoning is if it's flowering under 24

1911
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,199
7 in a mother room like i'm not really

1912
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:59,439
interested

1913
01:08:55,198 --> 01:09:01,678
no no i uh if i didn't do my job and i

1914
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,519
let him get root bound or cause that

1915
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,480
stress and he started flowering that's

1916
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,759
on me

1917
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:08,798
it's like

1918
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,439
i i can look past it and if i can get

1919
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:10,560
him

1920
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:13,358
uh

1921
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,159
his normal routine is to be in my bucket

1922
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,600
or his bag and he grows under there

1923
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,358
perfectly and

1924
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:23,120
things along that nature and doesn't

1925
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:23,120
flower and goes along

1926
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:28,000
but then this one certain time he got

1927
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,920
root bound and flowered and

1928
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,920
dropped pollen

1929
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,960
i can kind of overlook that

1930
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,440
i will say this though the rainbow mill

1931
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,679
he's almost died like four times this i

1932
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:41,358
have clones of it so um

1933
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,440
i'm just saying this

1934
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,679
so i have healthy clones at all times of

1935
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:49,439
them but i've let him completely dry out

1936
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:51,440
to where he was weeping

1937
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,639
dead and i'd give him water and he still

1938
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:56,319
didn't flower

1939
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:58,079
i love that boy because he flowers under

1940
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:59,439
12 12.

1941
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:01,198
so there is

1942
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:03,198
boy plants that won't flower under

1943
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,519
stress there's boy plants that will

1944
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,279
flower under stress but not in normal

1945
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,280
conditions and then there's boy plants

1946
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:10,319
that just like dropping pollen no matter

1947
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:12,000
what but

1948
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,439
if you stress a plant enough you can

1949
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,279
cause

1950
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,439
adverse reactions and

1951
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:19,119
you got to kind of look past it i in

1952
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:21,279
certain situations if you really like

1953
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:24,238
that mail

1954
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:25,519
so how many times have you ever done a

1955
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:27,198
project

1956
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,280
made the pollination growing out the

1957
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:30,238
seeds you know obviously the male was

1958
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:31,519
good in your mind that's why you

1959
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:33,119
selected it and then it just turned out

1960
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,120
to be a dud for whatever reason is that

1961
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:36,960
rather uncommon like do you think with

1962
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:39,760
proper selection you can avoid that or

1963
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,279
it's inevitable from time to time

1964
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,679
uh i haven't

1965
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:46,479
really picked too many

1966
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,319
bad males per se uh now i've made

1967
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:51,039
crosses that sucked

1968
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:53,359
i've made several that just were all man

1969
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:56,560
and once i wasn't putting that thing in

1970
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:58,399
there um so i've had crosses that were

1971
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,000
deads but i've never

1972
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:00,879
i don't i can honestly say i've never

1973
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,920
picked a

1974
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,679
male that just across the board sucked i

1975
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,079
usually only try to work with what i

1976
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:10,480
feel is the best of the best genetics

1977
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:12,719
wise and plant-wise

1978
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,039
with research and growing out and

1979
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:17,600
checking lots of different phenols and

1980
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:19,439
stuff um and i'm i'm pretty lucky in

1981
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,480
that aspect where i haven't

1982
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:23,439
put down a duds i did do a

1983
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,718
bunch

1984
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,879
and um

1985
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:29,198
i went call them duds because we grew

1986
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,560
the hell out of it outside but i didn't

1987
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:34,479
get a single

1988
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:36,719
skunky nose on one plant everything was

1989
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,479
super piney and super dank

1990
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,079
but nothing got a skunk nose and i was

1991
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:41,759
really depressed later on i did a

1992
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,238
project and got the skunk nose to come

1993
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,840
out but i felt like a failure

1994
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:46,718
for not getting the skunk in my first

1995
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,319
craw

1996
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,560
sorry what was that cross i think we

1997
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,679
lost the audio for a second there oh it

1998
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,760
was uh

1999
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,520
yeah it was just a older

2000
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,480
an older skunk to

2001
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,719
uh

2002
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:01,198
a skunk number one clone that i was

2003
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,039
gifted i had some skunks supposedly

2004
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,678
skunk seeds and i went through them and

2005
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:08,238
i found that roadkill smell was

2006
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:11,039
prevalent in these seeds i picked a meal

2007
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:13,519
and in veg he smelled soup

2008
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,920
and my female was pure skunk and i put

2009
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,480
them together and those first seeds

2010
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,560
did not smell like skunk i did it again

2011
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:23,198
with a different meal and i got a lot of

2012
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,880
skunks so my male just he tricked me he

2013
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,519
didn't throw down the skunk smells that

2014
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,600
i had planned

2015
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,159
that's interesting i we've spoken to a

2016
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,480
few breeders about this kind of quest

2017
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:36,399
for the roadkill skunk a lot of people

2018
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:38,000
are kind of renewing it now

2019
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,839
do you think it's possible for it to

2020
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,039
come back and more importantly do you

2021
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,600
think that when people talk about the

2022
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:45,439
roadkill skunk they're referring to the

2023
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,960
same strain or do you think the roadkill

2024
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:51,519
skunk is a bunch of different strains

2025
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,880
oh man i truly think that it's a bunch

2026
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:55,360
of different strains i think that

2027
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,239
there's a true

2028
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:00,238
okay so i think when we're younger our

2029
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,319
senses are a lot

2030
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,799
more open and i think that we get

2031
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:06,158
confused um

2032
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,760
now we're more our palettes are more

2033
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:10,399
refined with our cannabis smells we've

2034
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,239
been smoking it and smelling cannabis

2035
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:14,479
forever but when we're younger

2036
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,479
a lot of things just smell bad like oh

2037
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,000
my god that's stinky that smells like a

2038
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:19,678
skunk

2039
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,238
but there are truly strange that smell

2040
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:26,960
like actual skunks like a skunk sprayed

2041
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:28,718
and i myself would i go fishing and i'm

2042
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,000
out like we're i'm pretty close i'm in

2043
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,560
the country

2044
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
area so i sell skunks all the time like

2045
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,480
they're always out there they're

2046
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,640
dropping their spray i mean my dad had a

2047
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:41,198
pet skunk and it sprayed him in the face

2048
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,600
uh long story i won't even get into that

2049
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:46,079
but anyways i have a roadkill

2050
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,920
i was not really called roadkill it's

2051
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:48,640
called skunk

2052
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,480
but

2053
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,560
it smells like a

2054
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:55,198
dead skunk so it smells along those

2055
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,560
lines of roadkill skunk it was called

2056
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,000
skunk though

2057
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,560
excuse me

2058
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
it wasn't called roadkill skunk and i

2059
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,159
i think though like what you were

2060
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,039
alluding to is the fact that there could

2061
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:08,238
be

2062
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:11,519
numerous offspring of these same genetic

2063
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:13,919
pool plants that smell like a skunk and

2064
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,960
so a lot of people have a memory of kill

2065
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:19,279
skunk i hope more people work with it it

2066
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,880
was an amazing smell it's still an

2067
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:22,399
amazing smell

2068
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,440
i'll work with it again eventually i

2069
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,960
have a bunch of crosses i made years ago

2070
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:29,919
with it and

2071
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:32,399
i've been giving them away freely for

2072
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,640
12 13 years i've sent off hundreds of

2073
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:36,238
packs of them and no one ever grew them

2074
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,920
i don't know what they did with them

2075
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:41,198
they might have just let them die and

2076
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,600
not know what they actually had

2077
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:46,158
hopefully not

2078
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,920
yeah hopefully not but when people get

2079
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:51,198
stuff for free they just don't

2080
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:53,840
cherish it they think it's free yeah

2081
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:56,319
yeah it's it's such a such a relevant

2082
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,079
point because it it i mean it's it's a

2083
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:00,238
pretty well known phenomena like it's

2084
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:01,519
it's even undocumented but yeah you know

2085
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,198
people people don't value what they

2086
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,360
don't have to struggle for

2087
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:07,039
it's true if you don't have to pay money

2088
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,719
for something you're like oh i can that

2089
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:12,319
was free it's not good um i've given a

2090
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,520
packs of seeds those

2091
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:15,840
uh

2092
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,840
blueberry triangle i was making years

2093
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,199
ago and i was sending 100 packs or soda

2094
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,039
seed vault

2095
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:22,238
and letting them give them away people

2096
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:23,840
were finding some of the best looking

2097
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:25,279
cannabis i've seen it was

2098
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,800
insane and they would send me these

2099
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:28,158
messages going oh my god can i get more

2100
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,079
of these where do you sell your seeds as

2101
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:32,079
well i don't really sell my seeds but i

2102
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:34,079
can send you a few more bags but those

2103
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:37,600
things it was like blueberry buttery

2104
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:39,600
muffins with the look of massive buds

2105
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,079
and then you'd get these blueberry

2106
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,760
triangle-looking ones but the blueberry

2107
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,359
smell just ruled it that blueberry

2108
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,719
muffin smell just carried through on

2109
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:48,880
everything

2110
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,679
that's killer

2111
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,480
so

2112
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,399
last little thing on the road kill skunk

2113
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:56,238
some of the uh

2114
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:58,079
the common sentiment we heard expressed

2115
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:00,000
essentially is that maybe that roadkill

2116
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,399
skunk is just uh

2117
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,920
uh it derives from

2118
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,079
land race afghani you know like a

2119
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,520
particularly accurate kind of smell do

2120
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:08,880
you think that is the case and is it not

2121
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,480
kind of interesting that it's called

2122
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,400
roadkill skunk and it's like not a skunk

2123
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:16,639
at all it's like possibly just afghani

2124
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:17,920
well yeah it goes back to

2125
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,520
um

2126
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,039
the days when

2127
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,600
guys weren't really

2128
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,359
naming stuff you know and

2129
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,000
finally that one just smelled so much

2130
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,839
like dead skunks like this or

2131
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,640
a skunk spraying they just called it

2132
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,039
skunk um i know

2133
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,840
when skunk was coming around california

2134
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:40,000
was getting a lot of the afghani type

2135
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,960
influx of uh

2136
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,679
strains so it definitely

2137
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,679
would in my mind would lean that way as

2138
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,119
well

2139
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,079
yeah okay

2140
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:51,599
so

2141
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:52,960
what's your what's your opinions on the

2142
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,000
chem dog you ever want to breathe with

2143
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,198
or do you think it just doesn't gel with

2144
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,640
rainbow

2145
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:59,359
i chased

2146
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:01,119
a good kim cut for a very long time

2147
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:03,679
because i just heard

2148
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:06,158
how amazing it was and

2149
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,000
how great it was and

2150
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,920
and all these things um

2151
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,840
i personally

2152
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,480
got some cuts of it i ran them um

2153
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,600
it wasn't the cuts i got whether they

2154
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:21,119
were legit or not weren't for me

2155
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,239
would i be open

2156
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:26,238
to seeing another version of kim maybe

2157
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,839
one that was

2158
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:33,678
truly sure 100

2159
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:35,600
percent kim or kim one or kim sis or kim

2160
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,239
iv or whatever

2161
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,920
of course i would any i mean why

2162
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:41,198
wouldn't i you know

2163
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,520
you would be

2164
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:44,799
ignorant not to at least see

2165
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,440
this plan

2166
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:50,800
for sure but the ones i have grown that

2167
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:52,960
were considered and called kim 91 the

2168
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,920
one i ran that was called kim sis

2169
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,279
they just weren't for me

2170
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,640
was it like

2171
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:00,158
what did you think of it like just

2172
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,679
wasn't like

2173
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:04,559
like it wasn't potent or it just wasn't

2174
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,480
like the type of high you enjoyed

2175
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,840
yeah it wasn't the type of

2176
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:09,519
the structure of the plant the way it

2177
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,800
grew wasn't wasn't what i was looking

2178
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,840
for

2179
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:16,239
it wasn't my real i didn't mind the the

2180
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,760
the high and the one i had i actually

2181
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,359
enjoyed the flavor it had like this

2182
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,719
acrid

2183
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:22,158
uh funk

2184
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,399
to it um

2185
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:27,359
but the

2186
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:31,119
it just wasn't my kind of a plan and

2187
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:34,079
then the offspring i've seen come from a

2188
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:35,840
lot of the kim dog has a high tendency

2189
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:37,039
to throw

2190
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,679
issues

2191
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:42,238
after breathing and um it's something

2192
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,359
with my thai genetics that i have to

2193
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,799
take

2194
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:49,679
into serious consideration because

2195
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:52,000
ty isn't love doesn't love indoor

2196
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:55,039
growing like so it takes a soft hand and

2197
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,198
a lot of us like to push nutrients and

2198
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:59,519
my plants don't need a lot of food a lot

2199
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:02,079
of the time so i would think if i

2200
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,600
crossed rainbow with kim dog and people

2201
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:05,359
had a heavy hit

2202
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,679
next thing i know people would be saying

2203
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:09,920
i bred hermes and

2204
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:13,920
all these things and it's just something

2205
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,640
i have to be very aware of but i chased

2206
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,920
a

2207
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,360
good kid dog for years

2208
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,560
and

2209
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:22,799
i don't know maybe i just haven't got a

2210
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,400
good one yet

2211
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,239
yeah it's hard it can be hard to say i

2212
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:27,920
mean there's it's i think it's probably

2213
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:29,839
one of maybe that or sour diesel there's

2214
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,679
got to be like one of the most like as

2215
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,520
you said gelato you know those guys have

2216
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,239
all just got so many fake ones it can be

2217
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,440
hard to tell at times right

2218
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:41,678
exactly like i didn't like sour diesel

2219
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,439
until i finally had somebody say dude

2220
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:46,560
this is a real

2221
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:48,639
diesel cut try a flower this and it was

2222
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,880
it was it was really good like i was all

2223
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:55,520
damn that's strong cannabis

2224
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:57,520
so um and and i'm sad uh because i was

2225
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,880
gonna meet up with

2226
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,040
i didn't realize that the emerald cup

2227
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,719
ran out of time but i believe if it's

2228
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:05,119
peabod

2229
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,760
oh yeah yeah yeah yep

2230
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:10,079
as and he had some kim dog and we we

2231
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,119
talked about it a month or so ago and he

2232
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:12,479
was uh

2233
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:14,559
you could have came by the booth and

2234
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,079
tried real kim

2235
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,880
and you could have guaranteed it would

2236
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:21,760
have been real kim so that makes me sad

2237
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:25,520
because i could have tried for sure for

2238
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:27,600
sure real kim and made my opinion on it

2239
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,520
at that point because

2240
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,159
i need to smoke it and i see his gross

2241
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,520
and i see his fl powers and they i want

2242
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:35,119
to try them

2243
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,159
yeah so we'll just leave it at that for

2244
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:37,599
now because

2245
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:39,119
i can't talk about it because i don't

2246
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,039
know if i have ever got to grow a real

2247
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:43,840
freaking kim dog

2248
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:45,679
yeah and i understand i mean yeah peabod

2249
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,840
or skunk va would definitely be the guys

2250
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,399
to see to get some really nice

2251
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:53,039
verifiable stuff

2252
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:56,000
exactly and that's what i want to do

2253
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:58,399
so you kind of touched on it with the

2254
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,560
mentioning the tie and the tendencies it

2255
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:02,319
can sometimes have to herm do you find

2256
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,360
that there are any types of genetics

2257
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:08,559
which makes your type more prone to

2258
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:11,920
herme or is it more so as you refer to

2259
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,920
the way in which people treat it

2260
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,440
the number one will be people treating

2261
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:18,399
it

2262
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:20,399
they don't want a lot of food

2263
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:22,719
they don't even though

2264
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:26,000
you kind of lose the ring the thai look

2265
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:28,399
out and when i get to the rainbow part

2266
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,960
it's still so prevalent in there just

2267
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:34,000
light-handed there's

2268
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,719
i mean i feed quarter strength of

2269
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,359
these base nutrients

2270
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,679
um and that that's that's pretty much it

2271
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:45,759
i don't really do balloon boosters i i

2272
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:48,239
use a few um bud swells and a lot of uh

2273
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,880
micro life organic products and things

2274
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:53,919
like that a little biobiz

2275
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:57,119
so it's pretty much all natural

2276
01:21:53,920 --> 01:22:00,480
ingredients and um i still feed you know

2277
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:04,479
quarter and half strength as my capper

2278
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:07,759
and um i i don't get it to her but

2279
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:09,919
i haven't actually had any of them

2280
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,920
uh somebody sent me a picture this is

2281
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,239
completely honest the other day of one

2282
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:16,158
of the crosses

2283
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:18,079
and they had some had flowers and balls

2284
01:22:16,158 --> 01:22:19,920
on it and he showed me a picture of the

2285
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:23,519
button they were absolutely

2286
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:25,520
devastated with toxicity the leaves were

2287
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,440
dead there was no trichomes and

2288
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,679
the flower looked super dry and

2289
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:31,439
everything like that and i'm all

2290
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:34,000
i just have to make sure people realize

2291
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:35,759
you know take an easy hand with you

2292
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,520
you're gonna get a beautiful flower no

2293
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,560
matter what you do

2294
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:42,400
as long as you don't overdo it so

2295
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,560
um but

2296
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:46,000
ty

2297
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,480
indoors

2298
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
it takes a little while to get her

2299
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:51,359
accustomed to it and if you're grown

2300
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,479
from a seed

2301
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:54,479
you're gonna

2302
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:57,279
you know even if you get some bananas on

2303
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:59,439
one grow or a few uh

2304
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:00,960
balls on the grill if the plant's

2305
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:02,879
amazing

2306
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,600
you don't really have to just instantly

2307
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,520
kill it try again one more time because

2308
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,039
you can grow it out of it in certain

2309
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,400
situations

2310
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:12,560
and then you'll know

2311
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:14,719
was it stress or was it because it was a

2312
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,560
seedling or what it was did i do

2313
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,079
something wrong

2314
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,080
so give it another shot just keep your

2315
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:22,719
eyes on them but i haven't seen in

2316
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:25,279
saying that i haven't seen the

2317
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:27,600
unsolicited hermaphrodism in

2318
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:29,439
the seeds other than the ones i've seen

2319
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,159
when the plants are just absolutely beat

2320
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:33,919
to [ __ ] or burnt up and things like that

2321
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,439
which i still don't like i still didn't

2322
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,440
like to see that that

2323
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:40,799
that plant threw out balls

2324
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:42,479
on uh a seedling with flowers

2325
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,000
uh at all but

2326
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,638
with how much it looked like it was

2327
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,479
being fed and i don't know some of these

2328
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:50,880
guys are using some pretty crazy acids

2329
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,879
and it'll drop the ph so much and

2330
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,400
fluctuate that stuff and

2331
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,719
any plant

2332
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:58,559
has a potential to drop out

2333
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,960
and under those circumstances

2334
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,679
yeah without a doubt

2335
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,679
so one thing i did uh you know

2336
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,119
immediately pick up on was

2337
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,279
the quality of your weed you know some

2338
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:11,679
of the best i've ever had without it

2339
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:13,039
being soil grown what's your style of

2340
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,960
growing exactly you kind of touched on

2341
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,399
it a second ago but you know like let's

2342
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,960
how do you do it exactly fill us in on

2343
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:18,960
the details

2344
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:23,279
okay um

2345
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:25,520
i use the cheapest uh

2346
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:27,359
medium i can get whether it's

2347
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,520
coco core or

2348
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:32,719
basement mix or whatever oh trooper not

2349
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:35,360
basement mix tuper whatever coco

2350
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:37,198
mix i can get i use truly whatever i can

2351
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:38,960
get for about 10 bucks and then i reuse

2352
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:41,519
it a few times

2353
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:45,119
um i'm a calcium

2354
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:47,280
amino junkie those are two things that

2355
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:50,960
i use a lot of

2356
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:53,519
i really really like tricantenol so i do

2357
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,439
a lot of uh

2358
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,520
work with uh

2359
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,559
alfalfa and

2360
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,520
beeswax

2361
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,800
i go i got a lady out here in the orange

2362
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,159
groves who

2363
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,199
sells me her

2364
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,198
wax

2365
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,119
the the comb with a little bit of honey

2366
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:11,599
in it and i'll boil it down to make sure

2367
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:14,000
i get the trichantin all out

2368
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,600
things like that um the reason i can

2369
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,238
only use that at certain times though

2370
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,520
because it can it's an

2371
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:21,439
antimicrobial so it can kill some of the

2372
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,360
microbes so you don't use that in the

2373
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:26,479
teas and things um but it's a huge

2374
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:29,920
source of triganel

2375
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:29,919
i love my microblife products

2376
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:35,839
they're really well made the company is

2377
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,760
so easy to stand with and behind and so

2378
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:40,560
i like that and then

2379
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:43,039
my guy adrian from biobiz

2380
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:46,159
he uh hooks me up with uh

2381
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:48,079
a lot of biobiz products his uh

2382
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:51,039
sisters have his sister and mom have

2383
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:52,960
some of the same ailments as i do so i

2384
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:55,039
share medicine with them and

2385
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,279
ian returns you know shares the biobiz

2386
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:58,399
with me and um it's a pretty amazing

2387
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:01,039
product

2388
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,000
um but you know i keep things pretty

2389
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,960
simple

2390
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,679
uh rainbow grows itself it it truly does

2391
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,800
like so it's so special about her and i

2392
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,800
can't

2393
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:14,400
i don't really tell

2394
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,320
myself or to my on horn i i know i'm a

2395
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:19,359
good grower

2396
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:22,639
everything i grow whether it's

2397
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:24,238
whatever i'm growing it turns out good

2398
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:26,400
um so

2399
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:28,479
but i kind of just let the plants tell

2400
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,399
me what they want what they need and

2401
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:32,079
i've done it for so

2402
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:34,559
freaking long

2403
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:38,399
i just i don't measure anymore i don't

2404
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:40,960
own a ph meter i don't own a tds or ec i

2405
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,399
don't own anything uh i still grow

2406
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,679
people were like well you can't do that

2407
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:47,679
in large facilities i'm all okay well i

2408
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:50,079
do it in 20 lighters i've done it in a

2409
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,480
50 lighter is that how how big is a

2410
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:54,319
large facility to you you know i just

2411
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,158
have to do it on a larger scale i just

2412
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:56,960
pour more into my

2413
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,279
my

2414
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:02,480
reservoirs um

2415
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:06,319
but i am the worst person

2416
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:07,439
ever to try to mimic his gross

2417
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:09,759
because

2418
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:12,158
i don't do the same

2419
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,320
things over and over that i know of i

2420
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:16,079
used to take monotonous notes where i

2421
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:18,000
had binders and i'd

2422
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:20,079
keep track of what i did this grow and

2423
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,760
change this and change that and

2424
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:23,198
eventually i just got these products i

2425
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,880
really like and i do the same thing you

2426
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,198
know with these products and

2427
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,039
sometimes i'll use more

2428
01:27:27,198 --> 01:27:31,039
calcium if it's a new batch of cocoa

2429
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:32,399
that i'm using i'll really use a ton of

2430
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:34,479
calcium at the beginning to help

2431
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:37,759
saturate it um

2432
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:39,279
uh amino is a really a big part of that

2433
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,719
because they're the building blocks that

2434
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:44,000
i cherish and

2435
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,600
i'm obsessed with carbohydrates and

2436
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,920
things like that but

2437
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,920
i i don't really push anything i don't

2438
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,920
use salts i don't

2439
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,520
go for weight i think that's another

2440
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,279
thing that helps me is

2441
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:57,280
i don't really push like oh i need to

2442
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:59,679
maximize my yield i need the best yield

2443
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:01,599
i need the best yield

2444
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:04,560
if i get a really good harvest a bump or

2445
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,480
crop i'm super excited but if i got a

2446
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,400
great crop with a lower quality i would

2447
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,079
be mad

2448
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:11,839
the rainbow that you got from me i

2449
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:12,800
thought i did terrible that

2450
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,639
grow

2451
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,560
i had an electrical issue i wish you

2452
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,679
were here now to see this batch of

2453
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,360
rainbow because it's one of the best

2454
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,279
batches i've

2455
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:23,279
a flower i've ever produced out of any

2456
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:25,599
of my spots

2457
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:28,158
wow that'd be something to be seen

2458
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,480
so i guess with all that being said what

2459
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:32,158
would be maybe one or two tips you'd

2460
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:33,919
have for our listeners whether it be you

2461
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:37,039
know common mistakes you see or just

2462
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:39,520
things you've kind of picked up on

2463
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:43,840
um don't over water

2464
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:45,199
don't over water especially early um

2465
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,520
there's a lot of people who say you

2466
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:50,719
gotta water cocoa like hydro you treat

2467
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:52,239
cocoa like soil you get soil results so

2468
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:55,279
people start hitting that cocoa right

2469
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:57,119
when it transfers the first few weeks on

2470
01:28:55,279 --> 01:29:00,319
the plant in cocoa

2471
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,920
let it dry out let those roots

2472
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:03,840
chase and fill up your buckets or

2473
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,920
whatever you're growing in then you can

2474
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,920
turn on the turn on the gates and start

2475
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,960
to give it food um

2476
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:14,000
in saying that if you're going to water

2477
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:15,840
cocoa every day

2478
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,158
and you're using nutrients every day use

2479
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,400
half strength because you're feeding

2480
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:22,479
every day now you don't need to push it

2481
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:23,519
to the limit

2482
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:25,359
always

2483
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,199
if you're using salts add a product like

2484
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:28,639
drip clean or something to keep it clean

2485
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:30,960
and keep your salt

2486
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:33,119
mobile um

2487
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:36,639
don't over think it

2488
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:39,039
don't overdo it don't think that you can

2489
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:41,679
need 50 bottles to

2490
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:44,639
finish this plant pick a company's line

2491
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:46,399
and something simple for you and

2492
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:48,800
write it out there's a reason why they

2493
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:50,479
have everything for you and all that

2494
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,600
they spent a lot of money making those

2495
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:53,599
lines and

2496
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:56,079
try to use just the base nutrients on

2497
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,800
the grow if it's on your first growth

2498
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:02,238
just get your a and b or your a b and c

2499
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:05,199
dependent on the company and

2500
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:07,198
just that just ride those out see your

2501
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:08,559
quality and then if you want add another

2502
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:10,000
product um

2503
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,800
and

2504
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,520
don't short change your plant

2505
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:18,719
on you know your calcium and

2506
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,639
and aminos those are two very very key

2507
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:23,039
things if you're not using those

2508
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:25,840
products add it to it you'll be

2509

2539
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,320
don't think i could grow without

2540
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:37,039
um

2541
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:39,599

2544
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:47,439
elemental from roots organic i'm just

2545
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:48,479
discovering this product it's a

2546
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:50,238
powder

2547
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,439
calcium it's like 30 something percent

2548
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:54,079
calcium and

2549
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:56,319
it's changed how i have to force

2550
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:58,479
calcium onto brand new cocoa i sprinkle

2551
01:31:56,319 --> 01:32:01,198
that on the top and the first water it

2552
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:04,000
just saturates all my

2553
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:05,759
cocoa with calcium

2554
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and bud swell i really really really

2555
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,119
love buds well

2556
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,560
nice that's a that's a pretty

2557
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:11,519
comprehensive list for everyone there

2558
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,639
you go

2559
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,639
so

2560
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,600
next question i want to ask you could be

2561
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,440
pretty standard and we've already

2562
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,520
touched on it but do you have any kind

2563
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:21,439
of modifications to what would be

2564
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:24,960
considered the standard light schedules

2565
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:24,960
whether it be veg or flower

2566
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:31,279
um i go full spectrum so i go metal

2567
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:33,600
halide hps metal hbs in all my rooms

2568
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:37,119
um on my des

2569
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,960
so that's how i flower my plants uh

2570
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:41,439
i used to switch out to 10k bulbs at the

2571
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,760
ends but it became more of a chore

2572
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:44,960
than what i was seeing benefits

2573
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,199
um

2574
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:50,880
and then the mom room i'm pretty

2575
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:53,519
standard i go 20 on for off

2576
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:55,840
so they i still like my dark cycles

2577
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:57,360
um on the planet to at least have some

2578
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,440
dark i don't really

2579
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:02,559
run 24 7.

2580
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:04,079
um so it's pretty basic except for my my

2581
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,440
flower rooms i like more of a full

2582
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:07,760
spectrum light i don't just like to

2583
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:09,519
pound the hps i like to mix the metal

2584
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,239
allies in there

2585
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,679
yeah awesome and do you play uh pay any

2586
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:15,519
attention to

2587
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:16,719
things like vapor pressure deficit or

2588
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,400
anything like that or do you just have a

2589
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,880
pretty standard temperature and humidity

2590
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:23,039
you like to try to maintain

2591
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:25,039
first few weeks i run really really high

2592
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:26,639
humidity um

2593
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:29,679
80ish percent

2594
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:32,880
um and my temperatures are around in the

2595
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:34,399
80s as well and then after about week

2596
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,039
when i hit about week three i start

2597
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:39,599
lowering my temperatures

2598
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:42,238
and my humidity and then by the end i

2599
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,960
like to see my room get about no higher

2600
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:46,718
than 77 and i like my night temps to be

2601
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,840
in the 60s

2602
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:52,158
and uh my humidity levels to drop

2603
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,000
immensely

2604
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:57,119
yep

2605
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,719
so what's your recommendations for

2606
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:01,519
curing humidity and temperature wise

2607
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,319
um

2608
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:07,040
i usually dry in

2609
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,559
i usually dry everything together chop

2610
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:11,119
them off

2611
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,719
at long branches i still hang dry

2612
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:18,000
everything like that i usually keep it

2613
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:18,000
about 73 degrees 74 degrees

2614
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:21,839
my humidity levels i tried to keep them

2615
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,400
around that

2616
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,600
50-ish percentile um

2617
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:27,519
and it

2618
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:30,239
it dries them kind of fast at the

2619
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,239
beginning not fast that's wrong but i

2620
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:35,039
make sure with big heavy buds i don't

2621
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:37,599
get an any sort of bud rock

2622
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:39,519
or anything like that i keep fans going

2623
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,199
but i always face them up into the

2624
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,960
ceiling just so it's blowing the air in

2625
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:46,000
circles and then

2626
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,560
um but after about five to seven days i

2627
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,800
usually turn off my dehumidifiers once

2628
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,639
that big burst of uh

2629
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:55,119
humidity is gone i'll turn off my

2630
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:58,480
dehumidifiers and i'll let them sit

2631
01:34:55,118 --> 01:35:01,439
for another three to four days and uh

2632
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:03,279
more of a humid room but the humidity

2633
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:04,879
levels are a little higher and then it

2634
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:06,158
kind of slows down the drying process

2635
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:09,199
and then

2636
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:11,759
as soon as they're dry to me

2637
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:14,000
um i'm off the the stems and start

2638
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:17,760
trimming up my product and in

2639
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,198
my my big key to it is though is i don't

2640
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,159
take them off the stems that they're

2641
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:24,879
still moist i want them to be

2642
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:26,799
dry they can still be moist at the stem

2643
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,880
the stem being moist is okay but my

2644
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,920
flowers have to be dry

2645
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,840
um

2646
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,118
i don't like to take them off the stem

2647
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,360
when there's still moisture i feel i

2648
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:36,479
lose some smell

2649
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:39,279
and

2650
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:39,279
overall appeal

2651
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:44,238
and so

2652
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,319
when you breed is is there a specific

2653
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:48,319
attribute that you rate above others

2654
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:50,559
like do you think that you know given we

2655
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:51,840
referenced earlier how terpenes are the

2656
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,119
big thing at the moment do you think

2657
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,800
that if you're going to release

2658
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:56,319
something it has to

2659
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,719
have you know good terpenes be

2660
01:35:56,319 --> 01:35:59,920
eye-catching or would you be willing to

2661
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,399
you know put something out that maybe

2662
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,840
wasn't so in your face but

2663
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:06,000
if you smoked it you'd realize where the

2664
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,840
value was

2665
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,560
um

2666
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,880
i

2667
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:12,480
the number one thing will have to be

2668
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:15,199
the

2669
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:18,238
medicated part the high

2670
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:21,039
if you will it has to be there like i've

2671
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,959
bred for myself for just pure flavor and

2672
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:24,880
stuff was probably 12

2673
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:29,118
even down to eight percent with some of

2674
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,920
my uh calio crosses they were absolutely

2675
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:32,719
like

2676
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:35,679
low low low thc but the flavor was

2677
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:37,118
amazing and but i found that some of my

2678
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:39,359
clients would

2679
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:43,118
steer away from it towards my stronger

2680
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:44,319
one so i breathe for others for strength

2681
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:46,238
first or

2682
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:48,719
i won't say my numbers are insane i've

2683
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,638
never had rainbow tested so i couldn't

2684
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:53,039
tell you where she tests out at

2685
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,920
but her feeling the way you feel when

2686
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:58,479
you smoke her you know that you smoked

2687
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,319
and everything just relaxes and that's

2688
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:01,678
one thing i look for

2689
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:05,679
i look for

2690
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:06,560
everything to relax but not be sleepy

2691
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,960
all right

2692
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,480
so if that's

2693
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,239
if i was to pick something i know it's a

2694
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:12,959
weird thing to pick

2695
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:15,678
but

2696
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,600
my entire body to relax i want my head

2697
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,639
to be pushed back where i'm at oh there

2698
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,440
it is

2699
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:24,560
but i don't want to be sleepy because i

2700
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:26,879
work a lot i have a daughter she's very

2701
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:30,080
busy i'm very involved with her life on

2702
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,960
every day so i can't be sleepy groggy

2703
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:36,079
want to sit on the couch

2704
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:39,920
so with that being said are you overall

2705
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:39,920
an indica guy or a sativa guy

2706
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,039
i

2707
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:46,000
i'm a definite hybrid

2708
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:47,039
i don't like being any kind of racy

2709
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,439
because i've

2710
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,439
i've been uh

2711
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:53,678
i have a heart thing so i've been

2712
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:55,519
cardioverted multiple times so i don't

2713
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:57,199
like my heart to go fast anymore like i

2714
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,960
can't take it

2715
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:01,919
uh but i don't want to be counselok so

2716
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:04,960
i'm definitely a hybrid i'm a hybrid

2717
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,760
with a sativa leaning for the upbeat

2718
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,600
part

2719
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:11,840
but only to an extent i'm very picky i

2720
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,159
am probably the pickiest person i know

2721
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,480
when it comes to cannabis

2722
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:19,039
urge for me to like pick a side

2723
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:22,638
i want it down the middle like truly

2724
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:24,719
like i want this perfect perfect thing

2725
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:26,960
yeah okay it's a good good standards

2726
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:26,960
right

2727
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:32,479
yeah i guess i'm just an ass

2728
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:34,000
so

2729
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:35,599
just jumping back to the breeding for a

2730
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,679
second i forgot to ask this one back

2731
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,679
then what's your protocol for male

2732
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,679
pollination do you kind of like you know

2733
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:43,840
put the females in a few weeks ahead

2734
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,359
then put the males in and then just let

2735
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,840
them go and do their thing like how do

2736
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:47,839
you do it

2737
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,800
okay so i put my girls in

2738
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:55,600
until flower and i want good flower

2739
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,279
setting i actually like week three ish

2740
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,760
where i'm already having really good

2741
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:02,559
flower sets then i'll introduce the mail

2742
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,639
i always put the mail into the room

2743
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,000
i always keep a clone that's already

2744
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:08,639
rooted

2745
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,560
in the bedroom so i don't lose my boy

2746
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,960
the whole mail goes into the room as

2747
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:15,840
soon as he starts dropping pollen

2748
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,000
i'll put the fans on them

2749
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,480
all around in there i'll give him about

2750
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,560
two days and then i kill the male

2751
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:25,198
bag them and take them out i don't want

2752
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:27,840
any later pollinations i don't want

2753
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:30,559
dark seeds and then continue to

2754
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:34,079
pollinate as my flowers go or

2755
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:36,320
a bunch of white seeds so i try to do my

2756
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:38,559
pollination i let him have like two days

2757
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:41,118
where he starts really throwing his

2758
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:44,000
pollen and it's not like first bag that

2759
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:45,839
opens it's when he really starts opening

2760
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,760
up i give him two days and then after

2761
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,840
that once i feel that there's enough

2762
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,840
pollen in the air and everybody's got it

2763
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,800
my boy comes out

2764
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,800
interesting and i've heard uh

2765
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,560
i can't remember who said it i think it

2766
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,199
might have actually even been ken from

2767
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,960
gdp but anyway regardless i heard this

2768
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:04,960
weird sentiment expressed and i wanted

2769
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,399
to know if you'd ever had experienced

2770
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,439
anything like this but basically the

2771
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:09,920
idea is

2772
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:12,638
if you pollinate different branches with

2773
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,399
different males you'd expect that you

2774
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,079
know you'd get crosses representing the

2775
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:19,118
individual fathers someone once said

2776
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:20,880
that like a plant won't accept pollen

2777
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:23,279
from another male once it's already

2778
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,279
accepted pollen from like a first or an

2779
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:26,639
initial mail do you think that's like

2780
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:28,880
any truth to that or it just sounds

2781
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:32,480
hocus pocus

2782
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,760
i used to do a ton of limb by limb

2783
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:35,839
pollination

2784
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:39,360
um i'm trying

2785
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:41,600
to think if i actually used

2786
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:45,839
when i used more than one male on a

2787
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:48,639
single plant i know i did when i did

2788
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:51,279
the chocolate cherry and i did

2789
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:54,319
i wanted the chocolate chip cherry uh ac

2790
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:57,118
dc and i wanted the lavender

2791
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:59,118
tripoli wicked ac dc so i hit branches

2792
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:00,799
with chocolate cherry and they had

2793

2839
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:45,519
side note

2840
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:47,519
you grew the docido from seed what was

2841
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,800
it like to get those because i remember

2842
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,320
when they first came out like they were

2843
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,760
just so hard to get and they were so

2844
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:53,840
limited offering how did you score a

2845
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,199
pack

2846
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:56,319
a friend of mine gave them to me

2847
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:57,919
actually to

2848
01:42:56,319 --> 01:42:59,759
find a keeper

2849
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,600

2850
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,520
market he just that's what he did

2851

2856
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:18,559
world and um it was funny i had no idea

2857
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:19,520

2858
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,360

2859
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,719
he hit me up and said hey i want i have

2860

really hunting with the ogkb and running

2863
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:31,039
through my own work with it and putting

2864
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,600
it through its paces and hitting it with

2865
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:34,960
uh the redline pallet

2866
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,800

2869
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,800
try it and i said oh yeah man i'd love

2870
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:44,479
to see it just in case

2871
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,639
i don't end up liking what i'm working

2872
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:48,638
on i could work through this

2873
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:51,359
and he gave them to me

2874
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:53,440
and uh i popped

2875
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:55,759
i want to say six of them

2876
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:58,079
the first day i think there was it was

2877
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:01,440
an odd number it's either 11 or 13 seeds

2878
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:03,118
in the pack and i popped six six of them

2879
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:05,759
and the first six

2880
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:08,479
four were male and two were female and

2881
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:10,159
those i killed the males because i

2882
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,718
i kind of regret it but i killed the

2883
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:15,279
males because i don't really work with

2884
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:16,158
other people's stuff without permission

2885
01:44:15,279 --> 01:44:17,840
um

2886
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:18,799
then i kept the two females and they

2887
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,199
weren't

2888
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,960
they weren't what i was looking for they

2889
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:25,039
pop anymore

2890
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:26,000
and i end up popping the rest and then i

2891
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:28,639
found

2892
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,719

2893
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:34,480

2956
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,719
give you a specific example because i

2957
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:42,000
think it'll make it easier to answer

2958
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:43,439
if someone came up to you and they were

2959
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,960
like hey man i found a really nice

2960
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:46,799
female in one of your packets i'd like

2961
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,880
to use it in a breeding program and i'd

2962
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,000
be using a male that i created with

2963
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,920
other stuff

2964
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,600
would you be cool with me using that

2965
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:57,359
what do you think about that uh

2966
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,320
i would say

2967
01:46:57,359 --> 01:47:00,079
well

2968
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:03,198
i would say yes they they bought the

2969
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:05,840
seeds it's theirs use it uh just you

2970
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:08,319
know say what it is be honest about it

2971
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:12,239
when i reached out to use my docido

2972
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:14,158
female the first time i was told no to

2973
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:15,839
not use it

2974
01:47:14,158 --> 01:47:17,359
and then after the f2s came out and

2975
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,279
everybody was having it and everybody

2976
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:21,439
was working with doci though i was all

2977
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:22,800
man i gotta be able to work with this i

2978
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:24,238
paid a lot of money for these seeds i

2979
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,719
put a lot of time and effort into these

2980
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:28,559
seeds i'm gonna make some crosses with

2981
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,760
it i mean i pretty much filled with that

2982
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,280
plant

2983
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,520
i'm the one who helped bring that plant

2984
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:34,840
to where this is not dosy though as a

2985
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:38,639
cross but

2986
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:40,800
my plant my dostito my girl like the one

2987
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:42,800
that i'm growing i didn't create her but

2988
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:44,000
i brought her to life and

2989
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,520
kept her and i was like i'm going to

2990
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,840
work with it

2991
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:50,320
and so if anybody finds something in any

2992
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,560
of my crosses

2993
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:55,118
do it the only thing that

2994
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:58,320
would ever affect me

2995
01:47:55,118 --> 01:47:59,920
or make me sad will someday or

2996
01:47:58,319 --> 01:48:01,519
anything like that like i'd be all damn

2997
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:05,600
if somebody

2998
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:07,520
openly got something from me with uh

2999
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,760
that i didn't release

3000
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:13,440
and they made f2s

3001
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:16,320
and sold those f2s that would

3002
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:19,678
perturb me a little bit because

3003
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:20,880
if i didn't plan on releasing it

3004
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:23,359
and

3005
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,400
ah those kind of things what would give

3006
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:26,079
you the

3007
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:28,399
thought that you were like

3008
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:29,840
your ass off to make this i found a boy

3009
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:33,118
in a girl in tennessee put them together

3010
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:36,480
now i'm releasing f2s of it that would

3011
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:38,960
seem like that to me isn't proper but to

3012
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:42,000
each their own

3013
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:43,920
yeah it's it's interesting the way the

3014
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,479
dynamics of it work because i think

3015
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,719
ultimately what i was kind of intending

3016
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:50,399
with that question was in my mind that's

3017
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,920
one of the most reasonable requests

3018
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,839
anyone can make you know it's like i

3019
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:56,079
bought you seeds i'm using a female not

3020
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,679
a male so i think people tend to look a

3021
01:48:56,079 --> 01:48:59,679
bit more kindly upon that because you

3022
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,679
know you found it and whatnot and then

3023
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:03,840
most importantly they say and i'm going

3024
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:05,279
to use a male that's different i made it

3025
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,719
it's not really you know so i'm not just

3026
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:08,399
cramming two of your strains together

3027
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,679
you know it's like it's unrelated and so

3028
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:11,759
yeah it's interesting that there are

3029
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:13,359
some people out there who who would deny

3030
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,119
that when in my mind it's like that is

3031
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:16,880
seemingly the most reasonable request

3032
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,719
you could make while still showing the

3033
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,880
respect of asking and doing all that

3034
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:23,039
type of thing you know

3035
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:28,239
exactly i've been there i've been on

3036
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:28,238
both sides of it i've asked politely

3037
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,639
i would never tell anybody no on the

3038
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,039
email especially like you just said that

3039
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:37,920
they were using hey i'm using a mail i

3040
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:40,800
created i found this extremely special

3041
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:42,719
female in your work can i be all like oh

3042
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,639
my god yeah i'd probably be the kind of

3043
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,560
i'm the kind of guy be all like yeah but

3044
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:48,800
you got to send me some seeds is like a

3045
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:50,320
joke you know it'd be all like but you

3046
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:51,920
know i get some of those seeds like i

3047
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:54,639
got to be able to at least see them or

3048
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,880
if you find a killer cut let me get it

3049
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,599
yeah

3050
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,520
so and that's what i tell a lot of guys

3051
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:03,119
now is all i have so many guys growing

3052
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,880
my stuff now i'm all like i want to see

3053
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:05,598
pictures because

3054
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,400
if

3055
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,079
you

3056
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,638
having this many people grow my stuff is

3057
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:13,279
really rad because they're basically

3058
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:16,239
putting on a search that i can't do by

3059
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:19,118
myself so i have you know 100 dudes or

3060
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:21,039
something growing well men and women

3061
01:50:19,118 --> 01:50:23,679
growing out all these said straight

3062
01:50:21,039 --> 01:50:26,000
they're growing 10 30 50 different

3063
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:28,239
seedlings i get to see all those

3064
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,118
seedlings i get to see them all and be

3065
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:30,879
like

3066
01:50:29,118 --> 01:50:33,439
like oh my god that one's absolutely

3067
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,199
stunning would you be willing to trade

3068
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:38,319
me a cut

3069
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:40,719
that you found in my seeds for another

3070
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:42,880
pack of seeds or something else or

3071
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:45,039
two packs or whatever you want you know

3072
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:47,679
like i want that one and believe it or

3073
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:49,039
not most people

3074
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,039
offer yes

3075
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:52,719
when it's my work like the people who

3076
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:54,000
are growing my work and when i reached

3077
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:56,399
out to him and talked to him about this

3078
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,319
they'd be like absolutely like they were

3079
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:59,920
so happy that

3080
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:01,759
they i asked them and then they would

3081
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,440
ask me like well do you mind if i do a

3082
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,400
project with it and i'm all absolutely

3083
01:51:03,439 --> 01:51:07,198
not

3084
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:09,679
you own those you own those seeds and

3085
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:11,598
yeah but the only time like i said i'd

3086
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:13,039
ever have an issue is with

3087
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:15,520
there were some packs that i only

3088
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:17,760
released one pack and i did it

3089
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,239
to some friends or things along that

3090
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,159
nature or certain people and just some

3091
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:24,638
of those people took that a single pack

3092
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:26,158
of seeds where they got 10 seeds and

3093
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:29,039
they took a single

3094
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:31,279
boy out of their massive selection of

3095
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:33,599
three to five mil

3096
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:36,319
single female of their giant selection

3097
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:39,599
of you know five females and they made

3098
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:41,279
f2s and then released it that would

3099
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:44,079
it's disturbing because of their

3100
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:46,880
selection size with ten seeds first off

3101
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:49,279
and then the second one i never released

3102
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,760
it why would you release it you know

3103
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:53,439
like that that would be the only hold up

3104
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:55,760
i've ever had with it and then again if

3105
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:57,759
somebody did it i'd probably look past

3106
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,320
it anyways because how many projects do

3107
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:02,320
i have going i would never get to it so

3108
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:04,319
who knows

3109
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:05,519
yeah it's interesting

3110
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:07,759
so

3111
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,760
kind of related to your breeding will we

3112
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:11,920
ever see the release of any femmes from

3113
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,440
you

3114
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:15,039
i've actually been getting a ton of

3115
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:17,759
requests uh

3116
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:20,399
riot sent me his spray and um it's

3117

3164
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:13,679
by in my life that i don't use cbd

3165
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:16,719
products whether it's from lozenges to

3166
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:19,679
gummies to i have tons of my coconut oil

3167
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:21,599
cbd that i usually cook i'll buy a qp of

3168
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:23,920
cbd flowers from

3169
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:25,920
one of my organic friends and i'll make

3170
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:27,520
a bunch of coconut oil with it and it's

3171
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,359
really strong and i take a shot of it

3172
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:32,480
every morning or

3173
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:34,799
i'm not the biggest fan of uh

3174
01:54:32,479 --> 01:54:37,039
the isolates of this lids because

3175
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,800
it's just cbd i prefer a full

3176
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:39,760
plant extract but there's a few

3177
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,679
companies that make really good

3178
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:44,560
distillates now i had some uh

3179
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:46,319
cream from a company not too long ago

3180
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:47,840
and it was some of the best like face

3181
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:49,679
lotion i've ever had it was really

3182
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,520
amazing

3183
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:54,239
yeah cool so

3184
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,679
when you do that shot do you find you

3185
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:58,879
get uh

3186
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:01,760
as good of an effect from that say as a

3187
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:04,880
comparative dose say sublingually or do

3188
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:06,480
you find that ingesting it makes it act

3189
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:09,118
a little different kind of in the same

3190
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:12,238
way to thc is a little different to when

3191
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:15,679
you say combust it or inhale it

3192
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:17,439
well i really really like this

3193
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:20,239
this what i'm doing with this coconut

3194
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,839
oil and drinking it

3195
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:22,879
for some reason

3196
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,400
it

3197
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,679
it takes a little longer for it to kick

3198
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:27,519
in

3199
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:29,840
but once it kicks in it feels that it

3200
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:31,040
lasts so much longer

3201
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,800
and the

3202
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:35,519
i don't like anything with the alcohol

3203
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,360
tinctures in it so uh

3204
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:39,520
the

3205
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:42,000
i like to just use the coconut oil and i

3206
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:44,560
feel that since it's a fatty oil that it

3207
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,760
does better going through my digestive

3208
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:49,840
tract to really absorb everything

3209
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,960
yeah for sure

3210
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,480
so

3211
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,760
kind of relating back to the topic we

3212
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:55,519
were talking about earlier in regards to

3213
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:58,239
bringing other people's work i mean not

3214
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:59,040
really but kind of in that general area

3215
01:55:58,238 --> 01:56:00,638
how

3216
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:02,000
like what would be your general advice

3217
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:03,760
to someone who is trying to make the

3218
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,599
transition from say a grower to a

3219
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,800
breeder like if you if if you were

3220
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:07,760
talking to say someone who's a grower

3221
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,360
and they're saying to you i'd like to

3222
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,400
become a breeder but i'm not really sure

3223
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:11,598
what to do

3224
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:13,598
what do you think are kind of some of

3225
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,679
the things you have to do before you can

3226
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:19,039
you know really consider taking it on

3227
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:19,039
and becoming a breeder so to speak

3228
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:22,238
well

3229
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:25,118
i always tell everybody breathe for

3230
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:27,039
yourself first always breathe for you

3231
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:28,079
because worst case

3232
01:56:27,039 --> 01:56:30,079
you made

3233
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:31,198
some stuff that you know you're going to

3234
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:32,559
enjoy

3235
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:36,000
um

3236
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,920
that's probably my most

3237
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,599
important

3238
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,520
if i make something

3239
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:44,159
that i absolutely love

3240
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:46,560
then how can i ever be sad about it

3241
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:48,719
you know so as long as you're breeding

3242
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:50,719
for you

3243
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,079
you're you're golden and then other if

3244
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:53,359
other people start to like it and you're

3245
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:55,679
able to

3246
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:57,598
put it out there and have

3247
01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:00,239
people even buy them from you and then

3248
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:02,560
grow them and that's just all icing on

3249
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:05,198
the cake but the number one thing should

3250
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:07,119
always be breed for yourself don't go in

3251
01:57:05,198 --> 01:57:09,439
there thinking you're gonna make

3252
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:11,939
money off of it or you're going to do

3253
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:13,519
this or that

3254
01:57:11,939 --> 01:57:14,960
[Music]

3255
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:18,159
how would i say

3256
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:20,000
what to do don't start breathing before

3257
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:21,439
you've ever seen a plant don't buy a

3258
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,198
pack of seeds and think oh i'm going to

3259
01:57:21,439 --> 01:57:24,879
cross this pack of seeds with that pack

3260
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,000
of seeds you've never even seen the

3261
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:28,800
plants

3262
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:31,760
you're going to pretty much set yourself

3263
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,760
up for failure seed the plants grow the

3264
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:36,239
plants find the plants that are special

3265
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:39,280
and then go to it then if you find these

3266
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:41,919
girls that are wow that's an amazing

3267
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:44,000
girl i would love to see her with

3268
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:46,480
wow i found this really really nice boy

3269
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,039
over here those two should pair well

3270
01:57:46,479 --> 01:57:52,079
together i'll breed those two together

3271
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:55,039
um but don't go in there thinking i

3272
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:56,800
bought pack a from this breeder

3273
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:58,880
i brought pack b from this breeder and

3274
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,079
i'm breeding them together because

3275
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,359
then

3276
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:04,800
no matter what you're breeding them

3277
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:04,799
whether the plants suck or not

3278
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:09,599
okay awesome

3279
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:11,840
so interestingly enough we've seen a

3280
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:14,400
rise in the both the general interest

3281
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:15,920
and the concern of breeders involvement

3282
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:17,198
with filos

3283
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,960
how do you feel about firelist do you

3284
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:20,479
feel it's just a tool you know engage

3285
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,279
with it if you want or do you feel it's

3286
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:23,598
maybe

3287
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:26,000
i've heard from some people kind of say

3288
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:27,599
that it it could be like the first step

3289
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,039
to something a little more sinister in

3290
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,960
regards to

3291
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:33,439
patenting things like that what's your

3292
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,279
opinion on it all

3293
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:38,238
i don't

3294
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:39,279
like the patented part because you could

3295
01:58:38,238 --> 01:58:41,118
have some

3296
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:42,719
random guy that patented something that

3297
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:44,238
he had nothing to do with so i'll just

3298
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:46,960
start there with that just a little

3299
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:49,678
saying um what i do enjoy about it

3300
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,880
though is that some people pretend

3301
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,960
that they're the only people in the

3302
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:55,359
world with these

3303
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:58,158
clones or these guys who say that they

3304
01:58:55,359 --> 01:59:00,559
created this but they don't have any

3305
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:02,879
males or any other phenols they just

3306
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,679
have this one singular plant

3307
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,319
well

3308
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:08,880
if it gets tested and compared to other

3309
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:11,118
plants you can kind of know who's made

3310
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:13,199
what what's what and people have to be a

3311
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:16,319
little more honest but

3312
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:17,439
the problem with it will be is their

3313
01:59:16,319 --> 01:59:20,158
samples

3314
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:20,960
their samples have to be what they truly

3315
01:59:20,158 --> 01:59:23,598
are

3316
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,399
so in some of these older plants

3317
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:28,079
the kim's for instance

3318
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:30,719
if their sample

3319
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:32,639
isn't really let's say it's one of the

3320
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:34,960
ones i've grown

3321
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:36,239
and then somebody has a real kim and

3322
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,319
they bring it in there and they don't

3323
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:39,598
match well how do you know which one's

3324
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:43,118
the fake one and which one's the real

3325
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:46,079
one so that'll be the biggest issue i i

3326
01:59:43,118 --> 01:59:48,799
like the part that you can kind of

3327
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:50,479
dissect these plants and say well that

3328
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:52,639
person

3329
01:59:50,479 --> 01:59:55,359
is using this person's

3330
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:57,279
genetics because they match up

3331
01:59:55,359 --> 01:59:59,598
perfectly so they've just got the phenol

3332
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:03,759
of that and then they're working with it

3333
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:06,319
so i i do like that aspect i guess it's

3334
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:08,880
a cool thing but the rest of it is i

3335
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:08,880
don't know it's

3336
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:15,519
the whole thing

3337
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:16,719
is does it really matter like does it

3338
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,159
matter

3339
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:22,719
who made

3340
02:00:18,158 --> 02:00:23,920
this or who is claiming that or who did

3341
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:25,840
this

3342
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:28,560
it's an amazing strain that's an amazing

3343
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:30,880
strain if you have it you have it if you

3344
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,239
don't you don't but

3345
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,800
it is

3346
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:37,519
it is what it is i i think a lot of it

3347
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,679
gets down to that whole dick measuring

3348
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:42,080
thing you know like that's mine no i

3349
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:43,279
made that for personal i did that first

3350
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:45,679
so

3351
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:46,479
i don't know man that one's a tough one

3352
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:48,800
i

3353
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:50,399
i'm glad it exists but i can see

3354
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:52,000
the massive amounts of issues it's going

3355
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:52,839
to cost

3356
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,198
yeah

3357
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:56,880
okay so

3358
02:00:55,198 --> 02:00:59,678
quick little sneaky grow question i'm

3359
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:01,679
gonna sneak in here um i i didn't ask

3360
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:04,158
anything about ipm you know what's your

3361
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:06,239
protocol like clean and prevention is

3362
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:09,519
best or do you have any sort of ipm

3363
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:12,319
routine you do if you notice an issue

3364
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,360
um i used to use a product called green

3365
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:16,719
cleaner

3366
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:19,439
um religiously at least every two weeks

3367
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:21,599
or so um not because i had bugs but just

3368
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:24,238
because it was a rad product and it

3369
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:26,400
cleaned everything uh one one time there

3370
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:28,718
was blue green cleaner in my body my

3371
02:01:26,399 --> 02:01:30,719
bottle and it's always green and sprayed

3372
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:31,760
it on my plants and lost about i don't

3373
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:32,880
know

3374
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:35,679
one of my

3375
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:37,840
entire moms um because it was their root

3376
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:38,800
clean it was the root cleaner put in

3377
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:42,800
their

3378
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:45,520
foliar one so after that happens um i

3379
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:48,480
pretty pretty much just take great care

3380
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:51,679
of my plants if i bring a plant in from

3381
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:52,959
a unknown source or not let's not even

3382
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:54,399
say an unknown source because i would

3383
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:55,679
never bring a plant in from an unknown

3384
02:01:54,399 --> 02:01:57,039
person if i bring a plant in from

3385
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:58,719
somebody else

3386
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:00,800
it goes to the scope it goes through the

3387
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:03,439
isolation chamber and it just gets

3388
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:05,840
checked i usually i love cinnamon so

3389
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:07,839
i'll use cinnamon oil and spray around

3390
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,800
the plant i won't bring anything in

3391
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:12,400
that's all already in dirt because this

3392
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,279
whole root aphid epidemic is out of

3393
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:15,039
control

3394
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:19,439
so i will only

3395
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:20,800
bring in unrooted cuttings that i can

3396
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:24,079
root myself

3397
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:26,880
in my chamber and watch the plants and

3398
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:29,039
make sure that no bugs pop up

3399
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:30,719
and things of that nature and i usually

3400
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:34,479
keep my humidity levels in that room

3401
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:37,679
pretty high um just to force

3402
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:39,839
them that would possibly be on the plan

3403
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:40,880
yeah okay

3404
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:42,400
so

3405
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:44,079
recently

3406
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:46,079
you know at the emerald cup there was

3407
02:02:44,079 --> 02:02:47,279
this kind of sentiment which thankfully

3408
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:48,639
has been cleared up there will be an

3409
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:50,158
emerald cup next year but the sentiment

3410
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:51,840
was around like what's the emerald cup

3411
02:02:50,158 --> 02:02:53,519
going to be like next year you know

3412
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:56,639
what's your predictions given the legal

3413
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:58,840
changes in california recently

3414
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:01,118
well i was seeing that they're going to

3415
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:03,599
allow um

3416
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:05,118
at fairground type things like at

3417
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:08,000
fairgrounds

3418
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:10,079
they're gonna allow these uh

3419
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,399
events to take place like they used to

3420
02:03:10,079 --> 02:03:16,399
so you won't need all these

3421
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:17,839
huge licenses and stuff like that um i

3422
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:19,198
truly felt

3423
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,599
that if the only people who were going

3424
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:24,638
to be able to sell at these shows were

3425
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:25,920
the big corporations who would go

3426
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,639
i mean i don't want to go and give you

3427
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:29,920
90 dollars for a subpar eight

3428
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:32,400
um no

3429
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:35,279
see nobody who breeds seeds could be

3430
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:37,039
there because the guy most a lot of it

3431
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:38,399
who have been grinding the seed if

3432
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:40,000
they're not

3433
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:41,439
giant money guys they're not doing all

3434
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,760
these things are they going to be able

3435
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:47,759
to have a recreational license to sell

3436
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:49,840
seeds and things like that so i think

3437
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:52,960
that we're going to see a swing back to

3438
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:55,440
the way it was just for events just turn

3439
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:56,800
a blind eye for events and then continue

3440
02:03:55,439 --> 02:04:00,399
down

3441
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,400
this new road on uh

3442
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:07,759
daily living if you will or you know

3443
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:08,880
uh in the in the wreck world i'm so anti

3444
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,679
this wreck

3445
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:12,960
scene i've i've been peeking in on

3446
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:15,359
places and

3447
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,880
checking places out i mean uh

3448
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:20,078
a friend showed me

3449
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:22,239
he went to harbor side and bought 5 8

3450
02:04:20,078 --> 02:04:23,759
of some of the worst outdoor cannabis

3451
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:26,479
i've ever seen but it was all packaged

3452
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:28,400
in glass jars and fanciness and he spent

3453
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:31,039
over 400

3454
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:32,158
on 5 8 of brown stuff it was it was

3455
02:04:31,039 --> 02:04:34,880
unbelievable and they wouldn't even let

3456
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:36,479
them see the flower or smell the flower

3457
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:38,560
or touch it

3458
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:40,879
what he wanted and how much of it he

3459
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:43,840
wanted and they handed him a sealed

3460
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:47,840
container that he paid for it

3461
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:48,719
damn crazy yeah great that's why this

3462
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,319
wreck

3463
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:52,719
it's gonna work for some but it's not

3464
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:55,359
gonna work for most

3465
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:58,399
yeah totally right

3466
02:04:55,359 --> 02:05:01,039
so what do you foresee to be the future

3467
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:03,359
um is it a good time to be a medium to

3468
02:05:01,039 --> 02:05:06,800
small scale grower

3469
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:08,238
if you can grow really good cannabis um

3470
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,840
you're always going to have a place in

3471
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:10,638
the industry

3472
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:12,960
um

3473
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:14,400
because of those reasons people aren't

3474
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,800
going to go to the shops and want to

3475
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:18,879
spend that kind of money on the eighth

3476
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,599
middle of the road stuff they're just

3477
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:24,400
not going to will will things change i'm

3478
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:26,400
sure it will but boutique growers will

3479
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:29,039
always have a place

3480
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:31,519
in the industry because if you can grow

3481
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:33,519
amazing stuff that nobody else has and

3482
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,800
people want it they're gonna they're

3483
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,800
going to

3484
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,760
buy it so you can continue

3485
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,639
you know

3486
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:42,800
it's a job i mean it takes a lot of time

3487
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:45,199
effort and money to produce

3488
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,520
top of the line cannabis and the

3489
02:05:45,198 --> 02:05:51,359
hopefully the prices can continue to

3490
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:53,280
support those kind of growth growers

3491
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:56,238
yeah okay so it's not all doom and gloom

3492
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:58,319
like some might make out

3493
02:05:56,238 --> 02:05:59,759
i i don't think so i

3494
02:05:58,319 --> 02:06:01,840
people are still

3495
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,599
taking all my rainbow off of my my hands

3496
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:05,119
that i need to have for my medical

3497
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:06,000
patients and

3498
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:07,439
with

3499
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,158
i have to stop

3500
02:06:07,439 --> 02:06:12,799
moving it because i run out so i'm

3501
02:06:10,158 --> 02:06:15,198
pretty sure we'll be okay

3502
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:17,679
on that same note though the the kind of

3503
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:18,879
the meme sentiment at the last emerald

3504
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:20,800
cup was that

3505
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:22,880
if all these small scale guys were to

3506
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,800
die out all of them were just gonna

3507
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:26,239
immediately become breeders as like you

3508
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,440
know a bit of a joke but there was a

3509
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:29,519
little bit of that sentiment a lot of

3510
02:06:27,439 --> 02:06:31,439
people were switching over and it does

3511
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:33,520
in general seem as though the number of

3512
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:35,118
breeders in the market and just in

3513
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,800
general it's kind of exponentially

3514
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:38,319
increasing how do you think this is

3515
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,360
going to affect things in the long term

3516
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:42,078
you know do you think it's going to be

3517
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:45,519
hard to stand out

3518
02:06:42,078 --> 02:06:47,679
every name has seeds or genetics in it

3519
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:49,520
on instagram i swear

3520
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:51,440
guys who have never even made a seed

3521
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:54,560
have you know so-and-so seeds or

3522
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:54,559
so-and-so genetics

3523
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,800
i think what's going to have to happen

3524
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:01,520
is you're gonna have to have your own

3525
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:04,239
plate it's like like how my brother has

3526
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:06,639
purple people who want purple seeds

3527
02:07:04,238 --> 02:07:09,118
will go to see him to get his purple

3528
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:11,760
seeds um

3529
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:14,559
the or or you're gonna have to have

3530
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:17,119
something that really stands out like

3531
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:19,199
luckily for me rainbow is a huge

3532
02:07:17,118 --> 02:07:21,118
huge

3533
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:23,519
you know selling point people see her

3534
02:07:21,118 --> 02:07:24,880
and they're like wow that is a special

3535
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,560
cannabis plant

3536
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:27,679
i would like to try that or i would like

3537
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:28,960
to have some of the seeds or some of the

3538
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:30,719
flowers so

3539
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,800
so those are going to be big things i

3540
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:34,480
don't know

3541
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:36,400
how well people will do when they're

3542
02:07:34,479 --> 02:07:38,399
just working with this breeder and this

3543
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:41,039
breeder and putting them together and

3544
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:43,039
trying to know feeds

3545
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:44,719
i don't know how well those those kind

3546
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:46,800
of places will survive

3547
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:50,560
with the amount of breeders flooding the

3548
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:54,159
market now um but

3549
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:57,039
there's enough growers that want seeds

3550
02:07:54,158 --> 02:07:57,039
seeds will still sell

3551
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:00,158
that's good to hear

3552
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,078
so

3553
02:08:00,158 --> 02:08:04,078
what do you think is kind of the best

3554
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:05,920
way for the community to move forward in

3555
02:08:04,078 --> 02:08:07,759
a sense do you think that we should be

3556
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:09,679
trying more to kind of

3557
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:11,280
band our efforts together for like

3558
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:13,039
greater good goals that you know like

3559
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:14,399
require people to band together like

3560
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:15,439
things like a legislative change where

3561
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:16,638
you know like you can't really do it on

3562
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:18,078
your own or

3563
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:20,400
do you think that it's better to just

3564
02:08:18,078 --> 02:08:22,559
you know kind of everyone focus on doing

3565
02:08:20,399 --> 02:08:24,960
their own thing and just have more unity

3566
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:27,280
within the movement in general

3567
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:30,319
the unity thing

3568
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:32,158
should it should be it's so hard to see

3569
02:08:30,319 --> 02:08:33,840
so many fights

3570
02:08:32,158 --> 02:08:36,319
in over

3571
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:39,520
naming rights or it's all just about

3572
02:08:36,319 --> 02:08:42,880
money in reality all the fights around

3573
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:42,880
money so that's always hard to see

3574
02:08:44,238 --> 02:08:46,959
banding together

3575
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:47,759
i

3576
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:49,439
with

3577
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:52,560
a good voice

3578
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:55,678
in the lead to help push it

3579
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:58,639
it would it could work

3580
02:08:55,679 --> 02:09:02,078
but our problem is is that

3581
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:05,039
everybody is their own leader they don't

3582
02:09:02,078 --> 02:09:07,198
everybody wants to yell but not listen

3583
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:09,118
so that would be the hardest part

3584
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:11,839
especially in this community everybody

3585
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:13,679
has a voice but nobody has ears and

3586
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:15,840
they all want to just scream scream

3587
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:17,760
scream and this this this instead of

3588
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:20,078
like hey why don't we all get together

3589
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,400
and let's you know hash out these

3590
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:24,238
major things and let's get on board with

3591
02:09:22,399 --> 02:09:27,479
fixing this

3592
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:29,919
i still can't believe this 64 past in

3593
02:09:27,479 --> 02:09:32,078
california blew my mind like i was

3594
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:34,399
telling everybody i knew hey it's a

3595
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:37,118
terrible

3596
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:39,279
terrible idea it's not legalizing

3597
02:09:37,118 --> 02:09:40,880
anything it's not recreationally

3598
02:09:39,279 --> 02:09:43,279
everything i mean

3599
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:45,520
if you have over you know

3600
02:09:43,279 --> 02:09:48,000
of cannabis you can still go to prison

3601
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:51,199
how is that okay how is it okay for

3602
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,479
anybody to go to prison for cannabis it

3603
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:56,238
doesn't make sense it affected my life

3604
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:58,959
it's affected my family's life but

3605
02:09:56,238 --> 02:10:01,759
prison for cannabis crap you know since

3606
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:03,198
before i was born and i mean supposedly

3607
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:05,679
i was conceived

3608
02:10:03,198 --> 02:10:08,158
during a conjugal visit i mean come on

3609
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:10,239
it's affected my life nobody should be

3610
02:10:08,158 --> 02:10:12,158
in prison for cannabis this whole thing

3611
02:10:10,238 --> 02:10:13,919
like oh we'll let them have one ounce

3612
02:10:12,158 --> 02:10:15,039
but anything over that

3613
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:17,440
we're putting them in prison there

3614
02:10:15,039 --> 02:10:19,039
should be zero prison for cannabis like

3615
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:20,078
that's the one thing

3616
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:21,519
that

3617
02:10:20,078 --> 02:10:24,479
it has to stop

3618
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:27,760
it has to go away

3619
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:29,198
yeah yeah good good point to echo

3620
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,960
one of the last couple questions before

3621
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:32,799
we get into the quick fires

3622
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:35,198
do you think overall

3623
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:38,079
legalization has had a net positive

3624
02:10:35,198 --> 02:10:38,078
effect or not

3625
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:46,158
it's better than it was if

3626
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:48,158
was uh when i was growing in the 90s and

3627
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:49,598
i could have went to prison for one

3628
02:10:48,158 --> 02:10:52,559
plant so

3629
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:53,760
at least we're taking steps forward

3630
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:55,440
and so

3631
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:57,599
if we just need a bunch of more big

3632
02:10:55,439 --> 02:10:59,279
steps going forward so it's definitely

3633
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:01,520
better than

3634
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:03,198
one plant in a person's yard you go

3635
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:06,480
straight to prison so

3636
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:06,479
i'll say that at least

3637
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,480
yeah okay

3638
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:13,279
so

3639
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:15,118
what strain besides the rainbow has been

3640
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:18,559
the person it has been personally the

3641
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:20,960
most rewarding for you to have created

3642
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:21,840
honestly the red vine

3643
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,118
i mean

3644
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,520
that one

3645
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:27,279
can i you know what i'm gonna leave out

3646
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,840
chocolate cherry red vine and rainbow

3647
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:32,479
because this one's just giant

3648
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:33,679
um i'm gonna go with the

3649
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:35,519
the

3650
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:36,560
block head work that i did with the

3651
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,599
skunk

3652
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:40,719
um

3653
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:43,119
that one stuck so bad it smelled like

3654
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:45,599
rotted meat in a jar like it actually

3655
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:47,279
would trigger my gag reflex i missed

3656
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:49,840
that one a lot i need to get back into

3657
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:52,000
those seeds

3658
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:53,360
it was almost like trick flower i could

3659
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,198
like open the drum but i'll smell this

3660
02:11:53,359 --> 02:11:57,439
and people would smell and be like oh my

3661
02:11:55,198 --> 02:12:00,638
god what is that and like do the same

3662
02:11:57,439 --> 02:12:05,279
thing everyone got like gaggy over how

3663
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:07,840
repulsive that that plant smelled

3664
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:07,840
that's awesome

3665
02:12:08,158 --> 02:12:12,479
so

3666
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:15,759
down to the last quickfire questions

3667
02:12:12,479 --> 02:12:15,759
who's the best grower that you know

3668
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,440
oh man um

3669
02:12:21,039 --> 02:12:23,519
myself

3670
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:27,679
all right

3671
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:28,639
[ __ ] i i think i grow the best flower

3672
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:31,279
that i

3673
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:32,639
personally know like that i personally

3674
02:12:31,279 --> 02:12:34,639
you know like

3675
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:36,400
locally to where i'm where i'm at i

3676
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:37,840
don't see

3677
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:38,638
oh um

3678
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:40,960
no

3679
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,960
um

3680
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:44,559
oh god

3681
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:47,279
i can't remember his name

3682
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:48,400
um cultivar there's a guy named cultivar

3683
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:50,479
on instagram

3684
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:52,158
kid can [ __ ] grow so i'll say

3685
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:53,439
cultivar

3686
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:56,559
it's actually a trick question the

3687
02:12:53,439 --> 02:12:56,559
answer is jungle boys

3688
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:00,639
damn i miss that one

3689
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:05,520
so what's your prediction for the

3690
02:13:02,238 --> 02:13:08,000
hottest strain of 2018

3691
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,000
um

3692
02:13:08,319 --> 02:13:12,078
most likely uh

3693
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:16,359
i'm gonna say

3694
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:21,840
probably something crossed with

3695
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:24,158
freaking purple punch or

3696
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:28,000
with the mac

3697
02:13:24,158 --> 02:13:32,638
something in in those or one of the

3698
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:35,840
no uh sunday driver from uh colorado

3699
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:35,840
won't be the hot stream this year

3700
02:13:36,078 --> 02:13:38,960
nice yeah it's already got some traction

3701
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:40,000
for sure

3702
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:41,679
so

3703
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,359
opposite end of the spectrum what's the

3704
02:13:41,679 --> 02:13:45,840
worst strain to ever get a following

3705
02:13:43,359 --> 02:13:45,839
behind it

3706
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:50,400
oh my god

3707
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:52,719
i know i don't want to say this

3708
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:52,719
um

3709
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:55,920
you can tell me later

3710
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:59,440
i'll tell you later

3711
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:00,319
what was number two though

3712
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:03,039
um

3713
02:14:00,319 --> 02:14:06,078
number two would be uh

3714
02:14:03,039 --> 02:14:08,158
oh god it was uh quirkle

3715
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:10,719
okay there you go

3716
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:12,158
if you could only pick one land race to

3717
02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:14,480
smoke for the rest of your life which

3718
02:14:12,158 --> 02:14:16,799
one would it be

3719
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:18,959
oh i would have to go with a michoacan

3720
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,800
at a mexican

3721
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:23,198
nice pick nice pick

3722
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:25,279
so other end of the spectrum

3723
02:14:23,198 --> 02:14:27,598
in a way desert island weed you can pick

3724
02:14:25,279 --> 02:14:31,039
two strains any of them doesn't matter

3725
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:33,920
modern or old what are they

3726
02:14:31,039 --> 02:14:36,560
scdc and rainbow

3727
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:40,319
ah nice what draws you to the scdc just

3728
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:42,320
like the indica side of things or yeah

3729
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:44,078
it's it's kind of like rainbow it has

3730
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:45,519
the best of both worlds the strawberry

3731
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:47,279
cough is still there and the deep chunk

3732
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:49,199
is super prevalent

3733
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:51,039
has that little berry finish i mean i

3734
02:14:49,198 --> 02:14:53,439
get her to finish black like her butt

3735
02:14:51,039 --> 02:14:55,679
let's turn black and she's a really

3736
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:57,678
really special plant

3737
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:59,199
yeah she certainly looks it

3738
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:02,880
so

3739
02:14:59,198 --> 02:15:05,759
what is the worst grow product

3740
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:08,880
the worst grow product um

3741
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:11,520
oh god it's the

3742
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:13,840
the silica from that really cheap silica

3743
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:16,000
everybody uses it doesn't actually do

3744
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,599
anything for the plant

3745
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,198
good lord what's the name of that silica

3746
02:15:17,599 --> 02:15:22,800
that everybody uses

3747
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:25,198
it's not that osa 28 or whatever oh no

3748
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:27,760
no not the osa stuff i know this stuff

3749
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:30,719
is like ten dollars for a bottle um i'll

3750
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:33,360
think of stuff so uh oh uh shooting

3751
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:36,639
powder shooting powder is terrible

3752
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:37,649
shouldn't have has a show chewing power

3753
02:15:36,639 --> 02:15:39,440
is just the worst

3754
02:15:37,649 --> 02:15:40,799
[Laughter]

3755
02:15:39,439 --> 02:15:43,279
alrighty so

3756
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:45,920
indoor outdoor greenhouse you can only

3757
02:15:43,279 --> 02:15:47,599
have one which ones are going to be

3758
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:49,039
indoor

3759
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:51,360
nice

3760
02:15:49,039 --> 02:15:52,960
last but not least question

3761
02:15:51,359 --> 02:15:54,719
what is the best thing to happen to

3762
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:56,480
cannabis since you've been involved with

3763
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:59,198
it

3764
02:15:56,479 --> 02:16:02,000
the internet

3765
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:03,598
it's been the best and the worst

3766
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,399
the internet's changed everything we

3767
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:07,840
have a giant giant library that we all

3768
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:09,598
get to share

3769
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:12,000
if we choose

3770
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:15,360
uh it's changed everything no more

3771
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,198
little pieces of paper writing to europe

3772
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:20,479
seed breeders like everybody's on the

3773
02:16:17,198 --> 02:16:22,000
internet um yeah it started well after i

3774
02:16:20,479 --> 02:16:24,078
was already in

3775
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:27,679
cannabis but that was watching that

3776
02:16:24,078 --> 02:16:30,000
