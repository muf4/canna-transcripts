past year

i hope so

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,360
let's get into it

34
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,359
[Music]

35
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,640
alright so hello and welcome to the

36
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,959
inaugural 2019 podcast cannabis awards

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,439
these awards have been decided largely

38
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,199
based on the activities and occurrences

39
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,879
over the november 2018 to november 2019

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,640
period

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,319
and so what this means is that anything

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,359
gets released at say emerald cup or at

43
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,959
the end of the year that will go into

44
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,719
next year's running so we're largely

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,319
looking back seeing what's come out over

46
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,319
the last years

47
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,919
um so the awards categories for this

48
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,239
year are the following breeder of the

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
year most impactful seed drop of the

50
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,199
year

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,759
hall of fame strain

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,040
hottest newcomer breeder to the scene

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,438
most anticipated seed drop of 2020

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,840
most commercially popular strain

55
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,359
and clone of the

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,280
year so for the most part these awards

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
were decided by myself however i decided

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,560
to take into account the opinions of

59
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,479
several other notable people and i'm

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,159
lucky enough to be joined here today by

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,919
the one and only james beam thank you so

62
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,159
much for joining us

63
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,479
hello how are you i'm very good my

64
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,719
friend and the final component for these

65
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,359
awards was decided by some polls i put

66
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,120
up um so some fans got some input so

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
we're gonna try to provide some logic

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
and kind of some rationale behind each

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
of the decisions and just kind of

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,479
accompany the decision as to why we

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,399
chose them or what we think is good

72
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,799
about each pick

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
just as a personal note

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
a lot of these picks are not necessarily

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
my personal winners so you know the

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
clarity in the rationale will hopefully

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,200
back up why we're picking these people

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,680
and it's not just a case of oh that's my

79
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,598
friend so we pick them

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
so jumping into it

81
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,839
the first award we're going to discuss

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
is the most commercially popular strain

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,319
of the year

84
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,079
so without any further ado the winner

85
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,280
for this was

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,200
gelato and all of the extensions

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
what do you think mr bean

88
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,878
i think i think it nailed it on the head

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,158
i think i called it last year of course

90
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:21,280
i i know everything but uh no definitely

91
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:24,079
we saw the most crosses the most um most

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,878
breeders using it you know it's it's um

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,879
it's it's become unsort of i don't know

94
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,479
cool or uncool how it is but it's sort

95
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,158
of common these days for

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,598
um a new clone hit the scene and then

97
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,878
just everybody get it and then the

98
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,158
breeders work with it because it's a

99
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,679
clone it's they're all essentially

100
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,280
working with the same branch of a branch

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
of a branch because they just each have

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,519
a different branch

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
but uh then each breeder hits it and and

104
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
um

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,799
definitely gelato was the girl that got

106
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,559
passed around the most this year

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
so to say yeah

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
no questions there i mean at the emerald

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
cup we saw ridgeline win with their runs

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,519
and you know for this discussion i

111
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,359
consider runs white runs grunts you know

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,239
all of those derivatives it's just

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,400
gelato you know so in essence we saw it

114
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,319
win them or cut we saw it was an entry

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
in basically every high times every

116
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,479
competition of all varieties you saw

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,400
this year and i think most notably is we

118
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,159
we saw that it pretty much wiped the

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,358
hype market out for any other strain

120
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,199
that didn't have gelato or cookies in it

121
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,599
yeah that's definitely fair to say and

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
and there wasn't any uh

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
yeah there wasn't nothing else really

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,519
gained as much traction or as much as

125
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,359
much steam so to say as gelato and if

126
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,959
you didn't come with a lot of heat like

127
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
you know years past we've had tropicana

128
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,079
cookies and

129
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,918
other other uh things that have come

130
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,680
through but yeah this year was pretty

131
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,799
much the one that was common across

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,879
debris all the breeders was gelato cross

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
two right two right

134
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,959
so

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,680
on to our next award next i want to do

136
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,959
clone of the year 2019 i'm going to give

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,478
you a guess because i don't think it

138
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,680
takes much imagination to guess this one

139
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,758
um

140
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,519
this one's uh it's a long shot we'll see

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,240
the mac oh

142
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,240
how did you know

143
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,159
i don't know we're not supposed to sell

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,520
the mac i know that ah only the coolest

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
of the cool

146
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,000
yeah

147
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,439
it's an interesting one you know because

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,240
this one it's kind of been in the work

149
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,759
for like three years now hasn't it

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280
yeah i was gonna say it's it's got it's

151
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
had enough steam behind it for last

152
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,359
couple of years to be definitely i you

153
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,120
know i'm not sure how it uh how it all

154
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
has worked out or if everybody's happy

155
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,360
or not happy about the mac being in

156
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,079
circulation and sold uh and available to

157
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,240
most people but um initially it was a

158
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,800
harder strain to get for sure

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,560
yeah i mean in 2019 we really saw it in

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,720
full force you know dispensaries were

161
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,038
selling it the rappers are talking about

162
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,520
it every cup has several mach 1 entries

163
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,639
in it every instagram has photos of it

164
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,959
it's just

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,879
clone of the year without question but

166
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,799
the question is will it continue on do

167
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,279
you feel like we've reached peak mach 1

168
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,680
status yet

169
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,279
um i've heard of course i hear i hear a

170
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,720
bit from everybody but i've heard mixed

171
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,159
reviews on the mac i hear it's you know

172
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
great frosty and all that wonderful

173
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,439
thing but uh i also hear it doesn't have

174
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,680
a lot of flavor

175
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,600
kind of smells like my arm but um but

176
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,079
you know i the stuff i've gotten has

177
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
been has been frosty for sure so as a

178
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,439
breeding component from breeder's side i

179
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,560
would think that that would be

180
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,319
uh that would make anything that it

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
would touch you know it would enhance it

182
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
if you could so

183
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
of course so i wanted to give some

184
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,159
honorable shout outs for clone of the

185
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,758
year 2019 and the first one that jumped

186
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
to mind for me and i'm thinking you

187
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,199
might agree with me is lemon peel from

188
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,000
our buddy archive

189
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,520
yeah lemon peel or as a uh

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,399
uh

191
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,478
what's he calling one one star one stars

192
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,719
as it was known and so i gotta take

193
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,719
credit get on this uh maybe there are

194
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
the first podcast i'm on or you check

195
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
out my facebook in 2000 uh a year and a

196
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,799
half ago or two years ago i was freaking

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
out about that strain

198
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,560
he had given me some on a drop and i

199
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,639
actually i i went out to the car like

200
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
three times i was at my hotel just so i

201
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,400
could get high and smoke that weed

202
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
when it was gone i like i like made a

203
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,519
song about it you know

204
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,240
about because it was like my jar was

205
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,079
empty and i was so sad you know

206
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,598
it was it was definitely something

207
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,439
special i hit him back up that night and

208
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,199
i was like dude that's amazing and then

209
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,959
that next week i saw that he had renamed

210
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,720
it one star

211
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,478
um so on on that and just uh just to

212
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,240
throw a monkey in the in the monkey

213
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,159
wrench into the in sorts you know that's

214
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,759
from trojo right

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
really

216
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,759
correct archive popped it but credit

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
goes to trojo as far as creator of the

218
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,840
stream

219
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,080
there you go i know that it's uh you can

220
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,000
only really get crosses of it you know

221
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,598
he i think he said he doesn't have f2s

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,439
or anything like that so that's why i

223
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,878
think it's a good good entry for clone

224
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,399
of the year because it is truly a clone

225
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
you know like it's just the female

226
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,598
that's all there is of it

227
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,439
yep it's it's the great thing about

228
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,800
siege is you're if you're you're female

229
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,360
hunting you're looking for that one and

230
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,120
so trojo released it which he gives

231
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,038
credit to but it was it was archive that

232
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
selected it and found that particular

233
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,038
phenotype that everybody uh is in love

234
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,478
with but yeah i was i was rather

235
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,598
surprised as well right when i hit up

236
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,680
archive i was like when is that gonna be

237
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,439
releasing yadda yadda and he's like oh

238
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,400
yeah i didn't do that you know which is

239
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,000
which is

240
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,198
fletcher i mean that's that's that's his

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,319
credits what he would do you know i mean

242
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,439
he would be like no that's not mine

243
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,120
that's this dude's because that's what

244
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,000
he does he's a president you know he

245
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,959
doesn't want to get called out on

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,639
anything so um but yeah it's uh it was

247
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,120
it's a great strain i i loved it to

248
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,598
death uh the the few times i've had the

249
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,639
rosin's been amazing i love the flower

250
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,639
itself

251
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,879
um i know obsolete in love with it as

252
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,240
well so

253
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,958
perfect

254
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,278
well moving on to our next category next

255
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,038
we have the hall of fame and this one

256
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,360
was an interesting one because there's

257
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,679
really just a few contenders and

258
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
i kind of think that the obvious choice

259
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,759
in people's mind might be something like

260
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,360
og i mean of course these strains have

261
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,120
been ordered in the past it's not as

262
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,440
like this is the first time recognizing

263
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,399
how good some of these strains are but

264
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,399
for me i thought og is a little a little

265
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,639
before us and i thought that it's kind

266
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,200
of undeniable at this point that girl

267
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,120
scout cookies is really the hall of fame

268
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,759
pick for 2019 you know everything it's

269
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,519
given rise to the gelato the sherb the

270
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,200
dosy dough the mendo breath it's

271
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,360
basically countless at this point you

272
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,160
know it's it's the modern version of the

273
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,759
og and the popularity and it's got the

274
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,079
youth market in its grips that's

275
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,480
undeniable what do you think mr bean is

276
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
at hall of fame status

277
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
it definitely is from a from from a

278
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,759
strange

279
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,278
perspective from a breeder's perspective

280
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,639
i've you know we'll have to throw that

281
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,159
completely out of the ring and i just

282
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,919
i'm just going to take a like a breeding

283
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,199
point of view here i just you know i'd

284
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,399
like to know maybe and maybe it goes

285
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,000
back to the og but as far as who made it

286
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,320
there's a story behind it there's a myth

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,559
there's a legend behind it but whoever's

288
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
whoever actually created the strain or

289
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,119
meant to meant to do it or if that meant

290
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,278
to it all

291
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,200
has isn't hasn't come forward so to say

292
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,838
like it's you know i i know who i

293
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,600
believe it is but and and it's it wasn't

294
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
burner you know so

295
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,159
um from a breeder's standpoint no way

296
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,919
but from a strange standpoint al all day

297
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,600
like it's been just used in so many

298
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,078
things it's and it's

299
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
it's one definitely of this of this time

300
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,278
period that's taken the scene by storm

301
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
and is undeniable whether you like it or

302
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,958
not it you know you can't deny the

303
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,880
popularity of cookies that it's that and

304
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,919
the markets made on the industry

305
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,759
so 100 and i think you pointed to one of

306
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,078
the most important parts about it you

307
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,000
know like most big things it was bag

308
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,679
seed

309
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,440
yeah it wasn't it wasn't meant to be

310
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,958
done if whoever meant to do it they

311
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,399
would have extras they'd have a mother

312
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,159
they'd have a father they'd have pieces

313
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360
to put the puzzle again but if there's

314
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,600
never a male

315
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,839
uh then that means that that was never

316
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,519
meant to be and and and and backseat

317
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,200
strains aren't bad and we want to talk

318
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,480
about bad seed we're talking about you

319
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
know maybe some headband we're talking

320
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
about some og kush we're talking you

321
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
know some some great strains maybe

322
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
seven out of the top ten are gonna be

323
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,959
bags you've never meant to bees

324
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,799
but uh

325
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,039
i just it's yeah but definitely cookies

326
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,039
has made it has made its mark but uh as

327
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,599
it was like like like i say as it came

328
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,439
from backseat it backseat it shall have

329
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
and so it keeps it keeps throwing seeds

330
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,040

a motto to live your life but

334
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,760

next category is hottest new breeder to

336
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:21,759
the scene so for this one we had quite a

337
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,199
lot of entries but the overwhelming uh

338
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,480
answer was our buddy from alaska

339
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,278
akbrains so

340
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,039
you know sporting a huge wave of just

341
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,958
old-school genetics you know things like

342
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,199
northern lights this year he's had a lot

343
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,838
of success with his some mac crosses

344
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,920
with a male mac he found and selected

345
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,959
uh and just the most important thing to

346
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,278
mention is his new tkno haze which is

347
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,119
taking the scene by storm you know it's

348
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,799
it's got the potency it's the unique

349
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720
pairing of the old-school cush versus

350
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,639
the old-school sativa

351
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,560
it's it's a really beautiful hybrid and

352
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,519
it's a fantastic way to kind of start

353
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,039

a better uh taste of what is available

404
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,720
when we were speaking about the old

405
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,000
thai and chocolate ties and uh i did

406
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
kind of

407
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,039
i had some

408
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,198
seed stock from different various

409
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,519
sources and then went and grabbed a

410
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,958
bunch up and

411
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,639
i'm gonna run

412
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:12,399

413
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,240

418
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,359
he was giving that out as freebies and

419
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,760
if anybody slept on that they're crazy

420
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,839
because it was it's outstanding uh

421
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,838
good good chocolate time but the nl

422
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,600
sides real great too but a lot of little

423
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,480
things like that and

424
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
a

425
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
little bit of 80s chocolate thai that

426
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,679
was crossed to

427
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,679
boggs

428
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,399
strawberry kush and

429
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,919
i can't imagine the some of the flavors

430
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,839
and then

431
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,479
excited about uh

432
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,360
crossing the top the chocolatize

433
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,199
i'm gonna put it on the lemon tree and

434
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,320
some of the old standby

435
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:01,519
mothers that i have

436
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,800
fantastic so how about any collabs for

437
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,759
2020 on the horizon

438
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,319
you know i uh i've been playing around a

439
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,759
little bit with professor p from dynasty

440
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,680
he's uh me and him get along real good

441
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,439
and uh

442
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,958
we both benefit each other on anything

443
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,360
that we work on so there's a little bit

444
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,759
going on there and uh

445
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,480
he's been good enough to

446
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,278
gift me his medical cuts since i'm

447
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,519
really in need of some good medical

448
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,320
uh herb and

449
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,560
he passed me his grapefruit web which is

450
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,519
a seven and a half to seven and a half

451
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,838
it's

452
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,639
four percent perpend every time and it's

453
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,800
like

454
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,240
really good smoke so

455
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,559
that's one of the things i kind of think

456
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
is cool but he's he's done me some

457
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,239
favors there

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,078
kind of working a little bit on a nl

459
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,839

460
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:59,679

461
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,399
mr bob hemphill and i and

462

463
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,720
l2

464
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:10,319
i don't have much nl2 but a lot of nl5

465
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,120
sources a couple nl1 sources

466
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,160

467
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,919

time next year we'll have some pretty

472
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,679
exciting original

473
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,079
old heirloom

474
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:34,159
uh nl as it used to stand in the mid 80s

475
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,479
wow sounds like 2020's got some really

476
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,120
exciting releases in store let's wind

477
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,879
back though one year 2019 just wrapped

478
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,240
up what are you most happy with what

479
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,240
would you recommend to people

480
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:51,439
oh i've always been big on

481
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,399
things that are just super durable

482
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,399
heirloomish but um i love the freeze

483
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,559
land that i've worked with i love the

484
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,480
durbin that i work with

485
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,000
the vintage blueberry

486
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,519
they're uh

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,439
they'll hold their own against almost

488
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,519
any strains but they'll uh they'll

489
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,199
weather the worst summers and they'll

490
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,119
handle heats and droughts and they're

491
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,839
bug resistant and

492
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,879
they're mold and mildew resistant so i

493
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,720
really like those and i push those along

494
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
but people request them and really want

495
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,600
them anyway they hit me up and i'm

496
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,759
usually

497
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,279

i constantly get a lot of people telling

522
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,519
me it's about the best thing they have

523
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,160
had no ceiling it's just the fact they

524
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,759
haven't had a lot of that in circulation

525
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,919
for 20 years and it's first time they're

526
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,400
coming across it so

527
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,080
it's good to hear it and uh

528
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,080
continue with that a little bit

529
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,558

00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,038
love it can't wait to go hunting

579
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,558
yeah fishing fishing we can't kill all

580
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,079
the stuff we can just fish a little bit

581
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:41,660
okay sounds good

582
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:44,749
[Music]

583
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,749
[Applause]

584
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,319
all right so up next we're going to do

585
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,558
the most anticipated seed drop of 2020

586
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,720
so we actually had a tide first because

587
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,480
we had both a tie within the fan

588
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,079
selection as well as within my own mind

589
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,720
i found it very hard to discern the

590
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,279
clear winner so for tide first we have

591
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,600
the upcoming blue bonnet lines from riot

592
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,079
seeds which sports the blue bonnet mail

593
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,519
from texas resin company so this one is

594
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,599
essentially a blueberry offering that

595
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,720
was more refined by lone star to

596
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,000
generally

597
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,558
attempt to lock down more of the

598
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,558
blueberry flavors than say dj's previous

599
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,319
work had done so all the crosses are

600
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,440
looking really nice and exciting i'm

601
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,200
particularly looking forward to the

602
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,038
blueberry cross bubblegum which is meant

603
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,720
to have that really nice blueberry syrup

604
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,079
flavor to it

605
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,200
however

606
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:34,399
this was tied for equal first place with

607
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,440
the one and only karma whose new a5 haze

608
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,880
work is just looking to take people's to

609
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,360
the net is looking to take the haze

610
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,640
lovers to the next level so this is

611
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,798
essentially a northern lights 5 haze

612
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
cross that comes from original neville

613
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,200
stock from when he was releasing under

614
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,159
the seed bank and as such it's just the

615
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,319
pure old school super strong super

616
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,799
sativa so there's going to be crosses

617
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,119
with it as well as s-ones so mr beam

618
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,839
what do you think blue bonnet versus a5

619
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,599
haze which one you more excited for

620
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,678
uh you locked me in a corner guy pick i

621
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,480
gotta pick riot i love how uh how riot's

622
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,159
just

623
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,480
right right it's a great breeder and

624
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,000
he's he uh he's always wanted to give

625
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
credit and and like uh like we've talked

626
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,679
about earlier about about archive being

627
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,279
a you know a guy not to take undue

628
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
credit you know he gives credit to lone

629
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,319
star kicks back to texas present company

630
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,519
so um just uh it should be really good

631
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,759
i've already i've had a lot of guys hit

632
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,798
me up in the instagram and in my chats

633
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,558
track like hey when you're going to get

634
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,679
it when you're going to get it so um i

635
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,918
definitely think that's a hard choice

636
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,480
and then on the other side with karma we

637
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,640
also carry karma karma's great guy uh

638
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
the hazes uh

639
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,679
i don't think that this current

640
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,520
smoking generation has really had much

641
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,919
interaction with the hazes and may you

642
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,359
know or as much because they've been you

643
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,120
know like we've heard like we discussed

644
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,959
with the hype strains there's not a hype

645
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,319
strain that's a haze like not currently

646
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,319
you know there wasn't at least there

647
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,240
hasn't been in the sort of hype term

648
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,599
that we that we go to mention um and so

649
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,919
hazes could really come and knock people

650
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,678
out and it could be very interesting um

651
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,600
it's just for me it's just getting that

652
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,679
flower time down i don't know that

653
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,959
you know some of those strains that are

654
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,440
12 14 13 15 weeks

655
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,360
really are gonna make it

656
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,798
yeah it's it's a really valid point and

657
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,439
i think it's interesting because a lot

658
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,679
of the die hard fans who populate places

659
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,360
like instagram create this environment

660
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,720
where it seems like there's huge demand

661
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,000
and everyone will buy it when it comes

662
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,240
out and then you hear these breeders

663
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,839
talk about how when they invest the time

664
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,558
and the energy sometimes it doesn't

665
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:35,359
translate in sales

666
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,038
yeah no it's true and a catchy name and

667
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,359
a great picture sell you know a thousand

668
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,359
packs of seeds it's um but some guys do

669
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,639
put a lot of you know all the guys put a

670
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,240
lot of work into it there's a lot of

671
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,200
failure before there is success you know

672
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,440
there's a lot of stuff that you don't

673
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,880
want to release her that you know once

674
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,240
once you build up your rap you if you

675
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
release something that's shady well all

676
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,278
you're gonna do is just kill your rep

677
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,720
and like i've told my guys it takes you

678
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,038
know five years to build your wrap five

679
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
minutes to lose it and so they're

680
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,640
they're extra careful as far as testing

681
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,159
and putting putting stuff out and there

682
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,840
are some home runs about the same time

683
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,679
very home run there's there's a couple

684
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,240
you know strikeouts for sure

685
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,000
yeah of course so i wanted to give some

686
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,759
honorable mentions because in this

687
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
section we had a large number of people

688
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:17,200
who started giving um some suggestions

689
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,159
basically not for say a sea drop of 2020

690
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,159
but kind of a whole line from a breeder

691
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,240
and essentially we got an overwhelming

692
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,320
number of mentions for

693
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,159
the launch of crickets and cicadas which

694
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,319
is the new seat company from mr bob

695
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,440
hemphill and hannah bolt and yeah i

696
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,798
definitely want to give them a shout out

697
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,798
there's a huge number of people who are

698
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,158
really excited for these lines to drop

699
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,798
and they're working with a range of

700
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,559
really old-school exotic genetics like

701
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,480
skunk tangerine and i'm not talking

702
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,759
about tangerine skunk from barney's farm

703
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,519
which is [ __ ] i'm talking about

704
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,000
skunk tangerine which comes from oregon

705
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,158
kids and as well as things like northern

706
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,480
lights and the the nice land races from

707
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,080
when they were working at coastal so all

708
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,000
of these cool old school stuff getting

709
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,319
crossed in new ways to the more modern

710
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,119
stuff like thin mints and euro g kushes

711
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,240
and

712
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,079
yeah i think these guys are going to

713
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,400
make some really good waves next year so

714
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,759
keep an eye out for them

715
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,159

716
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,759

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,759
things like who would meet people off

739
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,519
the internet when you know like i have a

740
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,879
hard time meeting people off the

741
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,839
internet to

742
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
date you know what i mean but you would

743
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,359
meet we block people off the internet to

744
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,798

00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,960
the doing the dirty when nobody else

749
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,639

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,079
you know they were they were rebels are

751

period but now you know shout outs and

753
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,440

00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,839
uh oregon kids got some some stuff

755
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,798
working in washington but um that's nice

756
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,759
to see that they're working with this

757
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,519
stock

758
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,640
yeah that'll be cool to see some stuff

759
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,158
from oregon kid as well

760
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,440
yeah oregon kids great like i said

761
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,679
really nice guy we'd met up with him

762
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,519
we've had him on a couple shows uh

763
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,278
he's he's good dude he does has done a

764
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,679
lot for the scene you know that goes on

765
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,278
unmentioned and isn't making he's you

766
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,798
know a lot

767
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,240
this green rush a lot of people get will

768
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:37,440
get you know oh everybody's making

769
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,359
thousands and millions of dollars well

770
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,558
these guys didn't you know they they

771
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,079
didn't they're lucky they didn't get

772
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,359
five to ten years you know so um it's

773
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,879
it's nice to see if he would be able to

774
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,719
capitalize somehow on that and may come

775
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,000
out with some seeds or some come out

776
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,038
with something but

777
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,200
yeah of course he definitely put the

778
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,759
pacific northwest on the map for sure

779
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,038
oh yeah so on to the next category we

780
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,798
have

781
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,879
the most impactful sea drop of 2019

782
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,038
so this one might have a bit of a

783
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,360
surprising answer for some people but

784
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,119
i'm really confident in it

785
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,759
i think that the most impactful seed

786
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:17,678
drop 2019 was the australian bastard

787
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:19,440
cannabis from csi what do you think

788
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,000
wow i think i think caleb caleb's a

789
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,080
great breeder um i i definitely have

790
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,798
enjoyed listening to your podcast with

791
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:29,278
him uh there's the caleb the library for

792
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,918
csi um i know he has this prior to the

793
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,440
triangle line as well but uh that uh

794
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,960
australian bastard campus of course it

795
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,080
was it was a shoo-in i mean you're

796
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,079
you're an australian bastard

797
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,039
i set you up for that didn't i yeah well

798
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,960
kind of it kind of did but yeah but yeah

799
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,278
i think uh you know caleb has been in

800
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,038
the scene and and a vital part of the

801
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,599
scene for for a great many years and he

802
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:54,158
has a he has a great great library and

803
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,798
so um so that's a that's a big award and

804
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,159
that's uh it's pretty cool yeah yeah

805
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,319
what did you find familiar with the

806
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,919
australian bastard so to say well that i

807
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,000
think that's part of what plays into why

808
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,320
he won it is that it's so rare you know

809
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,480
even people in australia as well versed

810
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,319
with things as like myself or others

811
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480
even more well-versed they've never seen

812
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,839
it so the fact that he got it

813
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,038
successfully you know did a

814
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,199
repopulation has got the seeds out to

815
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,640
mark i think that's one of the aspects

816
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,120
of why it's so impressive but i think

817
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,360
the biggest thing for me is that it's

818
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,439
not really the seeds themselves the abc

819
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,839
it's it's the potential that it has to

820
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,640
affect future morphology and you know

821
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,158
imagine like a cookies bx3 that is

822
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,919
everything you want in cookies but looks

823
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,360
like the abc and you can grow it in your

824
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,200
front yard no one would ever know i

825
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,719
think that's where the real value in it

826
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,840
lies down the track and i think he's

827
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,120
working towards that type of thing

828
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,959
already cool so just the whole fact that

829
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,959
it was something that could have just

830
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,399
have gone off into and uh and there it

831
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,079
wouldn't have been lost forever but

832
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,038
instead it was taken by a quality

833
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:57,439
breeder uh re repopulated as you say

834
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,119
remixed fixed uh reebok brought back to

835
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,960
life and then and then redistributed to

836
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,639
the masses so that's uh

837
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,079
that's a that's a that's a big circle of

838
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,440
life to say that's really cool we'll

839
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,960
have to definitely see some things in it

840
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,720
because i i'm not familiar with the

841
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,000
australian bastard myself i know a few

842
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,759
but i'm not familiar with the strain

843
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,880
so uh that'll be very interesting i'll

844
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,240
have to go definitely have to go pick

845
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,480
that one up and when we leave here that

846
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,120
sounds uh interesting for sure yeah well

847
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,880
i mean it to me it kind of tied into the

848
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,439
work you guys are doing with humboldt

849
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
seedco and nate with uh the the freak

850
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,840
show project

851
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,240
the freak show just went on pre-sale

852
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,640
today uh the freak show

853
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,720
it's it's a different plant isn't it

854
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,240
very but it's similar to the abc and

855
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,919
that you know it's got that same

856
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,240
potential to really disguise things

857
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,240
and and i think that that's you know um

858
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,000
that may be the the cool new thing that

859
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,519
we're going for is how do we how do i

860
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,079
put it in plain sight without getting

861
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,200
nailed because everybody's doing it

862
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,558
these time of days you know what i mean

863
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,399
everybody's growing

864
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,000
um but yeah the freak show the freak

865
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:58,879
show is definitely something it looks

866
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,359
like it looks like it could be very

867
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,760
interesting um eric nugget nug shots did

868
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,079
a video of that and that guy's amazing

869
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,158
um i love that video so

870
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,519
uh we'll see what the freak show entails

871
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,880
and i'll definitely go go pick up the

872
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,798
abc for sure

873
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,720
yeah lovely so i just want to give a few

874
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,158
quick honorable mentions for strainer

875
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,960
these are probably the more conventional

876
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,440
ones on a technical side a congrats to

877
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,360
again caleb from csi for doing the tk

878
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,759
s1s a feat that's never really

879
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,678
commercially been done due to how hard

880
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,519
the triangle is to actually reverse so

881
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,840
congrats and we've also got the sauer

882
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,480
bx2 from karma a lot of people were

883
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,918
really hyped on that however the biggest

884
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,319
talking point and the one i want you to

885
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,799
talk a little bit about for me is we had

886
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,639
an overwhelming response from people who

887
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,558
said that the most impactful sea drop of

888
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,720
this year was candy rain

889
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:49,038
and i think that really it just

890
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,079
indicated how fresh this is still in

891
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,038
people's mind for all the wrong reasons

892
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,918
uh

893
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,200
800 bucks for breeders that you don't

894
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,720
know

895
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,360
who didn't do the thing that they told

896
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,360
you they did first of all

897
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,759
that's like that's like buying a bag

898
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,519
like here smell this bag of weed and buy

899
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,119
these seeds for that

900
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,120
well this bag of wheat has nothing to do

901
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,798
with that that box of seeds like are you

902
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,079
selling with the seeds that weed because

903
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,398
you know as

904
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,199
it's the honestly classic bacon switch

905
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,239
but on a luxury edition if you will

906
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,919
um

907
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,960
so what i know about the candy radio and

908
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,880
and

909
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,960
i guess one of the sad things is

910
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,480
last year we did uh we did like a little

911
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,319
cup kind of me and dunn did it in

912
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,319
massachusetts people gave us stop by the

913
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,278
booth they gave us give us a allegedly

914
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,678
gave us a gram we gave them 10 off um we

915
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,440
sampled them all um one of those samples

916
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,600
we got was candy rain

917
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,919
and it was like

918
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:48,158
of all the things it was probably the

919
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,759
definitely the smallest and maybe

920
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,159
not maybe not the worst but it was

921
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,798
definitely down there it was just so

922
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,679
bad and what i got notoriously from it

923
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,038
was like i heard 5 out of 30 like 2 out

924
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,519
of 30. like those were the numbers

925
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,119
coming back as far as germination rates

926
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,480
and so when anything is that bad and

927
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,398
then i was talking to jay beezy and

928
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,000
about the whole thing and these like i

929
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,839
had to go and fix it i'd go do these

930
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,038
things and you know he tried to

931
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,398
go contact all the people that had

932
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,879
bought it and just you know send him

933
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:18,158
free free gear because you felt bad

934
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,799
for uh the cookies fam but but um

935
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,080
you know i uh that's hilarious it's good

936
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,759
that the public got it that they

937
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,759
understand that you know just because

938
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,599
it's 800 bucks doesn't make it good you

939
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,519
know what i mean um

940
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,038
don't get taken by the hype and uh i

941
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,278
don't know

942
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,599
i'm glad i dodged one with a bullet um

943
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,278
you know cookies moving forward uh you

944
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,719
know they have a little bit different of

945
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,480
a game plan and we'll see how that works

946
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,480
out for them um

947
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,919
but yeah that's

948
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,000
that's kind of breeders just proving

949
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,080
that they didn't do what they did like

950
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,880
how how'd that london pound cake go

951
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,319
yeah

952
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,000
right

953
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,439
i i think the interesting

954
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,798
the interesting thing about this one is

955
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,360
that it technically actually happened in

956
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:59,200
2018 but it's still so fresh in the mind

957
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,959
and i think the other thing which leaves

958
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,278
it fresh in the mind is the fact that

959
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,519
people were waiting for something to be

960
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,200
done about the situation in 2019 and

961
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,278
that failed to happen so i think that's

962
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,759
where it's really kind of rubbed a bit

963
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:14,319
of salt in the wounds and of course this

964
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,759
poll was done before the current drama

965
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,000
cookies are facing which was at the

966
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,158
recent emerald cup the prevalence of bud

967
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,919
rot or botrytis in the outdoor flower

968
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,480
they were selling so it seems like they

969
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,960
go from drama to drama

970
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,038
i didn't hear about this one uh oh the

971
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,038
tea i tell you what uh that's very

972
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,200
interesting that's that's horrible like

973
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,919
as a

974
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,679
as a breeder or as a solid grower you

975
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,200
would know that and you would see it by

976
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,240
trimming and you'd never let that touch

977
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,840
your table

978
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,278
and so that just goes back to the point

979
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,759
that they didn't make the cookies

980
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,200
because if they did that or they were

981
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,038
responsible for that they never would

982
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,759
have let that hit their table they would

983
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:51,839
have

984
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,519
spotted it way before that and pulled it

985
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,199
and seen it before anybody saw it and

986
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,519
blasted into some high priced oil that

987
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,519
they sold you but because nobody had

988
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,200
mold or bought rice anymore we just have

989
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,720
a lot of oil these days

990
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,399
so

991
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,038
that's horrible of being on the west

992
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,398
coast i'm very familiar with that and uh

993
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:09,918
that's is

994
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,398
horrible that whatever they were selling

995
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,158
had had that on it not only did they

996
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,838
have it tested but to have let that go

997
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,800
and let them sell that especially at

998
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,599
their prices oh my gosh

999
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,280
yeah

1000
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,039
so they've got great marketing people

1001
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,879
i'll give it a give them that

1002
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,358
that's one thing they've got down pat

1003
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,199
but uh on that same topic you know you

1004
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,279
fit that category in my opinion so from

1005
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,199
your point of view from c t now's point

1006
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,960
of view what was the most impactful seed

1007
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,878
drop for you guys

1008
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,240
i i can't i can't pick my favorite child

1009
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,398
you know what i mean i have i have a lot

1010
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,799
of good children they all do different

1011
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,559
work and unique work and i'm just happy

1012
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,320
to get the gear that i get from them and

1013
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:49,358
be able to make it make it uh make it

1014
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,679
make it to the public um any honorable

1015
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,598
shout outs i know that you mentioned

1016
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,838
earlier in the year to me that you were

1017
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,760
thinking about maybe the story and cream

1018
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,759
drop from exotic as one contender

1019
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:07,279
so that's comparing apples to oranges so

1020
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,800
to say okay um exotic isn't a is in a

1021
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,280
different category so to say i don't

1022
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,280
know he he's crushing it he just he just

1023
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,119
crushes it for now for people who are

1024
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,920
looking for for that

1025
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,599
for what so if each breeder did this if

1026
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,039
it was if this stuff that was that we're

1027
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,119
talking about if this was just done out

1028
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,719
of a book that you could read um i

1029
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,160
wouldn't need 50 different breeders i'd

1030
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,759
have one because you would be doing it

1031
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,838
by the numbers and it would be you know

1032
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,880
science it's each breeder is unique and

1033
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,039
different they all look for different

1034
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,720
things exotic what he goes for and his

1035
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,519
clientele that they go for what they're

1036
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,519
excited about are rock hard frosty nugs

1037
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,079
and and he's you know he hits down the

1038
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,838
park every single time it seems um that

1039
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,359
as far as his releases go he doesn't hit

1040
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:46,559
it out of the park every single time

1041
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,039
some of these trains never make it to

1042
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,960
market he'll dispose of them um before

1043
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,719
they even get see the light of day but

1044
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,639
the stuff he's been releasing just just

1045
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,799
crushes it um he's doing a thin line

1046
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,598
right now we'll have that drop on

1047
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,920
new year's eve uh he's got six different

1048
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,359
strains the grease monkey femmes those

1049
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,039
should you know there's crescent emerald

1050
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,039
cup we stole the city sold out of most

1051
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,400
of his most of his regular stock 80

1052
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,920
percent as regular stock than the first

1053
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,800
hour at emerald cup

1054
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,880
so

1055
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,320
um his yeah i told him i said what are

1056
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,400
you doing they said you left gear at

1057
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,720
home he's like i didn't expect it

1058
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,240
but uh but no exotic is he's he's a

1059
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,838
different world but um some of some of

1060
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,479
the newer guys we had we released this

1061
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,639
year the irie irie genetics

1062
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,679
jeff uh we started working with him his

1063
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,960
his drops uh it was really good uh we

1064
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,358
added him to the bank he's had a really

1065
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,280
good uh uptake this year um we added a

1066
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,039
muerta at the end of the year he's got a

1067
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,400
really good following and really good

1068
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,039
gear and he's been you know definitely

1069
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,280
work these lines and

1070
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,079
has had some had some good strains uh

1071
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,720
done loud uh they've released their

1072
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,560
recent collab uh micro tech had a good

1073
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,480
release dj short released his breeder

1074
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,480
series so there's just

1075
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,920
there's a lot i can't pick you know one

1076
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,159
over the other but there was definitely

1077
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,079
some um because each breeder is

1078
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,358
releasing just about you know two or

1079
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,119
three times a year now they've gotten it

1080
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,279
so up to a point so when a breeder

1081
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,720
really holds back and and does something

1082
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,760
out of the ordinary i think that's when

1083
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,598
it'll get

1084
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
you know truly that unique that unique

1085
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,599
area but right now everybody's doing two

1086
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,800
or three times a year and and depending

1087
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,000
on the customer or what you're looking

1088
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,760
for you're going to have a different

1089
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,358
breeder that did it for you this year if

1090
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,599
you're a guy that likes sativas or mine

1091
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,799
races then so and so did it for you this

1092
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,240
year and you wouldn't be going for

1093
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,760
exotic because that'd be the opposite of

1094
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,959
what you want it's like when you put

1095
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,640
exotic and dj short on the same panel

1096
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,720
they

1097
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,920
it's just so night and day like dj short

1098
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,759
wants big

1099
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
leafy larfey buds because that's what

1100
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,800
makes the best hash which does

1101
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,480
exotic wants frosty hard nugs because

1102
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,480
that's what flower's the best he likes

1103
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,599
to smoke because he does and so

1104
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,960
depending on their viewpoint you're

1105
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,160
gonna have a different guy that that's

1106
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,639
your breeder so

1107
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,639
nice try but i'm not picking one

1108
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,279
brilliant brilliant diplomatic answer so

1109
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,440
that brings us to the big

1110
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,760
final category for this year the breeder

1111
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,720
of the year award so

1112
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,160
for 2019 the breeder of the year not too

1113
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:08,799
surprising goes to caleb of csi he's had

1114
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,319
an absolutely huge year with i'm about

1115
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
to just start rattling off a list that's

1116
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,880
going to sound endless but the skittles

1117
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,119
s1s the tks ones trainwreck s1s and

1118
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,640
cheese s1s in the works all the hybrids

1119
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,000
with all of those to things like girl

1120
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:24,400
scouts to og kush he does huge 80 to 100

1121
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,079
plant pheno hunts of his own work finds

1122
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,720
the keepers and then breeds with those

1123
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,359
keepers he's done durban poisonous ones

1124
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,480
cali oranges ones bubble gum s ones old

1125
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,920
family purple s2s as well as his pirates

1126
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,480
of the emerald triangle which is a lot

1127
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,320
more regular based work so he's done an

1128
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,159
extremely large amount of preservation

1129
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,119
work he's done some technical feats

1130
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:47,118
which was the tk the triangle kush swans

1131
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,599
as well as taking out the uh most

1132
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,358
impactful strain with the abc it's

1133
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,519
fairly undeniable he's been on fire this

1134
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,400
year

1135
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,079
uh

1136
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,240
well i'll say you kind of copy my pants

1137
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,640
down to be honest buddy uh

1138
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,639
but i i've we we have caleb on the bank

1139
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,639
um like i said earlier i think he's a is

1140
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,078
an awesome breeder and uh i think i've

1141
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,358
been sleeping on him unfortunately i've

1142
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,519
been doing my customers maybe a little

1143
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,880
disservice um i don't know that we had

1144
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,880
or we got most of those drops

1145
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
unfortunately um and so i think i'll be

1146
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,200
giving a a call to caleb as soon as we

1147

1266
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,838
one i um yeah i think it's on the way

1267
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,399
out there was far less big like marquee

1268
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,078
tents holding stalls there was

1269
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,000
a really

1270
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,079
small number of familiar faces you know

1271
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,679
i felt like i didn't recognize any of

1272
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,000
the people running the booths there were

1273
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,879
like big corporate companies i actually

1274
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,480
saw

1275
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,559
one of the girls who was working one of

1276
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,000
the booths on like a greyhound bus like

1277
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,440
a week earlier like i was catching a

1278
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,440
greyhound down

1279
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,960
and um and so it just all clicked for me

1280
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,960
it's like wow they're like shipping

1281
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,159
trimmers in from northern humboldt to

1282
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,240
run these corporate booth stands

1283
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,960
and it's just trash it's just [ __ ]

1284
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,118
trash um there was a few companies who

1285
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,679
are trying to do good stuff like

1286
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,200
i don't want to name names because i you

1287
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,199
know but basically

1288
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,639
yeah it was it was weird you know there

1289
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,358
was the cookies tent there was probably

1290
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,279
about 10 breeders in total at the whole

1291
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,880
venue it was crazy and some of them

1292
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,960
weren't even selling seeds you know the

1293
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,680
big names were selling seeds like

1294
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,960
capulet uh swamp boys exotic mike those

1295
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,598
guys are always going to draw a big

1296
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,838
crowd and do well but a lot of smaller

1297
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,960
guys just weren't represented at all and

1298
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:22,719
it just didn't feel like the normal

1299
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,079
emerald cup have you heard anything

1300

1318
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,200
i had a feeling last year was getting

1319
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,639
there and this year they were not

1320
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,239
uh they were not they were not wonderful

1321
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,799
to me either you know i should always

1322
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,318
watch what i say but

1323
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,359
they kind of left us hanging last year

1324
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:08,960
and this year we didn't give them the

1325
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,960
chance we decided we're going to sit it

1326
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,318
out and um we didn't want the corporate

1327
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,039
feeling so instead we did what was

1328
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,880
called the digital cup and so we did we

1329
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,960
all the breeders that couldn't go to the

1330
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,559
emerald cup they did their release with

1331
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,199
us on the digital cup

1332
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:25,599
and so we had aficionados do release uh

1333
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,118
seattle chronic seeds do release

1334
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,400

1335
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,760
a couple other

1336
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,599
diamond data release

1337
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,800
and then we did panels as well so we had

1338
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,960
a we had a

1339
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,800
panels on our form where they called in

1340

those are all in the forums on c2 now

1345
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,920
but it was kind of cool you could just

1346
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,920
sit from your head like the comfort of

1347
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,000
your couch and order order the gear get

1348
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,240

1349
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,358
wait in line not pay 150 bucks not get

1350
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:58,399
rained on

1351
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,279
so

1352
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,880
yeah

1353
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,319
do you think the digital cups are going

1354
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,640
to be something going forward or do you

1355
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,039
just think people will just find other

1356
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,358
events that have got more applicable

1357
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,679
kind of rules and regulations that are

1358
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,679
you know a good environment

1359
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,440
i on that honestly i don't know our

1360
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,118
digital cup we had three categories we

1361
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,880
had uh you know the best picture you

1362
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,079
know grow out our gear send us the best

1363
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,079
picture and we'll choose and you you

1364
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,400
know get a nice pack of it you win very

1365
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,920
nice very nice prize second thing we had

1366
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,760
uh you know pimp the merchandise karen

1367
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,240
that cat uh

1368
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,160
category where you know pick your uh you

1369
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,439
send us images or logos or so you know i

1370
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,440
think it seats you now what comes to

1371
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,440
mind if we pick your design and use it

1372
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,639
on t-shirts and give you a nice prize

1373
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,720
um

1374
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,879
then we had another category as well so

1375
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,759
uh you have to edit that some stone i

1376
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,119
forgot what the last category was

1377
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,720
um

1378
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,920
so you had three categories uh which

1379
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,759
which you could enter in that people

1380
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,000
would win uh different prizes and

1381
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,240
whatnot yeah but i definitely think it

1382
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,679
will have uh we're gonna keep doing it

1383
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,479
we had a great success with it we did

1384
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,318
great in sales and so um you know not

1385
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,920
every breeder can afford five to ten

1386
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,679
thousand or is licensed and can't get a

1387
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,200
booth of their milk cup but yet they all

1388
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,199
have their strains that they've been

1389
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,879
working on all summer and so we're just

1390
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,960
giving them an outlet to sell it on on

1391
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,680
the website so

1392
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,760
yeah okay that's exciting

1393
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:20,879
yeah i was pretty thriving we had over

1394
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,800
5000 photos submitted in three days

1395
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,720
so it's pretty awesome

1396
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,559
yeah yeah i'm excited to see that and

1397
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,759
especially because that's one of the

1398
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,119
incentives about getting down to these

1399
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,559
events is that there's good sales

1400
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,800
there's a lot of good information to

1401
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,480
pick up and i think that that's really

1402
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,280
what draws people to the events more

1403
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,760
than

1404
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,440
maybe the the music or the other things

1405
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,200
which the emerald cup seems to think is

1406
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,318
the draw card

1407
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,439
and that's that's an excellent

1408
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,800
observation because i thought that as

1409
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,679
well i mean you guys are putting way too

1410
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,000
much

1411
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,358
too much emphasis on your on your music

1412
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,358
draw when you should be putting it on

1413
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:53,838
your your your information your

1414
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,598
education and your in your people draw

1415
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:57,440
um but they do what they do and they'll

1416
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,880
they'll they'll come with it and as far

1417
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,318
as your last question goes as far as

1418
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,240
what we'll see and what the what the new

1419
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,719
thing will be i don't know

1420
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,679
what i do know is that it seems that

1421
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,799
wreck

1422
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,318
kills

1423
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,640
shows

1424
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,000
period that's it washington washington

1425
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,679
used to have shows had high times cup

1426
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,519
said this had that wrecked past no

1427
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:16,639
public consumption killed washington for

1428
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:18,480
shows

1429
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,400
portland passed wreck how do you stop

1430
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,440
shows there high times there same thing

1431
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,200
right past killed shows once rec passes

1432
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,119
if you consume in public or you sell

1433
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,558
things without paying your taxes on it

1434
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,000
the state is right there to watch you

1435
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,200
and they'll shut you down

1436
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,440
and so i'll bet there's probably at

1437
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,358
least 50 to 100 regulators there at

1438
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,480
emerald cup probably watching that's why

1439
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:37,598
you didn't see a lot of seed companies

1440
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,119
selling because they didn't have their

1441
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,359
correct permits or

1442
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,358
or her licenses needed

1443
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,199
um and so i don't know that california

1444
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,960
will california in whole not just any

1445
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,759
cup but the californian whole will come

1446
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,679
back and have what we saw as as

1447
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,359
festivals back in the day

1448
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,879
but i don't know moving forward that the

1449
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:56,880
rest of the country that

1450
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,480
um unfortunately the west coast hasn't

1451
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,480
killed it for you because it seems like

1452
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,800
these states as they pass they go

1453
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,159
quicker like they they're quicker with

1454
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
the regulations right i think right out

1455
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:06,639
of the gate they're doing this they're

1456
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,000
doing this they're regulating how much

1457
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,920
electricity you can use and how much

1458
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,519
square footage and and it's like wait a

1459
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,039
minute it took it took working like

1460
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,800
three years to figure that out you guys

1461
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:16,880
are coming out the gate with it

1462
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,480
and so they're so i think that just to

1463
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,280
the bigger the bigger thing i think you

1464
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,960
know what festivals are left and and and

1465
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,720
uh cannabis events that there are that

1466
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,559
are consumption public that have public

1467
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,078
consumption are definitely numbered and

1468
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,640
i think they're their ways their days

1469
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,880
are their way their days are numbered

1470
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,159
and they're all the way out but um you

1471
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,680
know we still don't see a public

1472
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,159
consumption bill in the states where

1473
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:39,838
people can go and consume in public like

1474
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,598
uh even the states have been passed the

1475
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,759
longest five and seven years still do

1476
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,000
not have public consumption yeah you can

1477
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,839
drink alcohol and do it at a bar but you

1478
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,800
can't smoke in public

1479
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,199
so

1480
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,079
yeah it's interesting the kind of

1481
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,558
inequity of it all

1482
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,839
yep wreck kills parties it's always true

1483
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,960
they say wrecked won't kill medical if

1484
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:00,078
they're lying

1485
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,920
yeah they say

1486
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,960
parties they're lying

1487
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,880
yeah

1488
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,838
definitely a clear observation from

1489
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,599
california's experiment

1490
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,119
yeah and then i hear you know there i

1491
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,960
know their taxes were insane when i was

1492
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,400
there last year i paid like almost 30

1493
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,559
tax on everything

1494
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,160
and so i'm sure it wasn't much less

1495
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,079
but yeah

1496
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,078
but uh so what else did you do while you

1497
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,200
were at the emerald cup

1498
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,318
i

1499
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,039
did some

1500
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:29,039
did some recordings got some some cool

1501
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,400
content recorded which we'll we'll

1502
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,838
hopefully be able to air soon we've got

1503
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,039
a little

1504
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:37,920
i got a cool one-hour video recording of

1505
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,440
uh mean gene myself and mr bob hemphill

1506
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,280
just talking about some old school

1507
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,679
strains at me and gene's place and it's

1508
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,839
uh it's a pretty wild pretty wild video

1509
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,519
i think the the real strain heads will

1510
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,239
really get a kick out of it so that one

1511
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,679
will be a ct now exclusive

1512
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,959
wow

1513
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,879
you didn't tell me about that you got me

1514
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,720
super excited i mean those guys are

1515
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,160
hemphills has some knowledge i mean gene

1516
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,959
is you know like i said i think that guy

1517
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,799
pops more seats than anybody i know um

1518
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,960
uh so that would be definitely very very

1519
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,039
interesting and yourself being um you've

1520
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,800
got to be one of the most uh educated

1521
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,318
guys i know in cannabis as far as

1522
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,240
histories and stories and know what

1523
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,119
comes from where and access to things

1524
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,799
and so

1525
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,079
um that would be very very interesting

1526
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,880
and wanting to hear that

1527
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,800
uh

1528
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,400
so what can we expect out of the podcast

1529
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,559
in 2020

1530
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,559
yeah good question um i think i'm going

1531
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,640
to focus on trying to do a bit more

1532
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,319
video content where possible obviously

1533
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,879
geography can make that hard at times

1534
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,800
but for a long time we've been trying to

1535
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,960
line up some big names together you and

1536
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,318
i and i think that we're we're at that

1537
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,000
point of being able to clinch a lot of

1538
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:39,838
them so i'm hoping for

1539
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,280
2020 to be the year where we kind of

1540
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:42,799
take things overboard and i think we've

1541
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,559
been making some good progress on that

1542
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,559
so hopefully the fans can have something

1543
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,040
to look forward to and get a bit more of

1544
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,960
a behind-the-scene look at some of the

1545
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,639
really big name breeders who have really

1546
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,318
put a lot of effort and contributed a

1547
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,078
lot to the scene

1548
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,920
definitely i think that that with that

1549
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,839
just comes you know with time i think

1550
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,440
that i know that um

1551
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:05,279
a lot of a lot of these breeders have

1552
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,519
maybe mentioned to me you know uh

1553
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,200
uh how long that laos can stand for and

1554
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:10,960
they don't want to you know i'm gonna be

1555
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:12,318
public you know you know i've been doing

1556
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,599
this thing for the last seven years i

1557
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,679
was doing this for five years ago it's

1558
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,599
like so the fire statute limitations as

1559
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,039
far as i know that statute limitations

1560
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,318
is running out and i know that some

1561
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,440
people have expressed concerns about i

1562
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:22,558
am not going to go up there to admit who

1563
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,559
i am when they saw the statute of

1564
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,480
limitations on me they can still convict

1565
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,559
me for [ __ ] i did five years ago so i

1566
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,800
think that now we're we're so far in the

1567
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,000
in the legalization that these guys can

1568
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,200
start to come out and they believe it

1569
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,800
that we're legal a little bit more

1570
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,799
they're not just you know they're not so

1571
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,800
quick to jump on the train of of belief

1572
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,559
that everybody else is and so they might

1573
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,000
be coming to light more and say yeah i

1574
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,519
did this and i was the guy responsible

1575
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,559
for this and that so

1576
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:45,679
hopefully we can definitely see more of

1577
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,440
that next year

1578
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,358
yeah god if some of these people want to

1579
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,639
come out of the shadows and

1580
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:52,880
kind of let us know what they're

1581
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,318
responsible for that would be amazing

1582
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,760
yeah and i think that goes to you know a

1583
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,279
lot of the guys are still in the shadows

1584
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,960
because they're still in the shadows you

1585
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,720
know they they had to be like if you

1586
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,240
were if you were the guy who's making

1587
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,919
the most noise in the block and driving

1588
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,358
a shiny car and wearing too much gold

1589
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,480
you're the guy going down you know

1590
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:08,480
they're the guy the cops are going to

1591
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,559
look at and so they made it to where

1592
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,760
they are believing that that's how they

1593
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,040
had to operate

1594
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,160
and so now they're not they're not

1595
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:15,838
they're going to be the quickest ones to

1596
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,679
switch over and say okay sure it's legal

1597
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,239
i'm going to come out and say i did that

1598
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,279
just so i get busted jerks idiots you

1599
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,039
know so

1600
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,040
um they're they're smart they're not

1601
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,239
quick to quick to jump on things and you

1602
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,679
know i think i see more and more of them

1603
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,000
believing that hey it's a real thing and

1604
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,118
you know it's it's people other people

1605
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,559
are making money on it i might as well

1606
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,559
come out and get some too

1607
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,240
yeah and so they should

1608
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,760
yeah definitely uh definitely some of

1609
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:38,879
these guys deserve it

1610
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,319
but yeah it should be definitely

1611
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,160
interesting for 2020 and how are the

1612
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,599
laws in australia coming along uh what

1613
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,920
how are we this year compared to last

1614
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,838
year speaking of awards anybody out in

1615
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,880
australia doing good things for for good

1616
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:49,759
people

1617
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,240
um

1618
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,559
you know what i i heard a good analogy

1619
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:57,279
when i was in the states which is that

1620
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,040
australia is about 40 years behind the

1621
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,000
state so if you think about what things

1622
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:04,480
were like in the late 80s in the states

1623
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,960
that's about where it's like so we don't

1624
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,960
have a real medical scene it's it's

1625
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,039
medical by name but it's essentially a

1626
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,720
system designed to keep you from

1627
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,960
actually getting any medical cannabis

1628
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,719
it's it was it was it was introduced by

1629
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,240
the conservative government so of course

1630
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:20,078
there was going to be something up about

1631
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:23,358
it like why are they legalizing cannabis

1632
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,039
that's not their card and so

1633
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,318
angle yeah so what they did was they

1634
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,079
figured it out like they thought we'll

1635
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:30,079
legalize cannabis we'll win over all the

1636
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,240
young voters who aren't conservative but

1637
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,760
in reality we're not actually going to

1638
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,919
legalize cannabis it's just going to be

1639
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,920
legal in name so then so they didn't

1640
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,680
actually piss off yeah so they didn't

1641
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,000
actually piss the older conservatives

1642
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:43,838
off but they won over the young vote

1643
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,318
until the next election when people

1644
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,318
realized it what it was so

1645
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:49,759
um to be honest i'm not holding my

1646
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,519
breath for anything legally

1647
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,880
groundbreaking to change but hopefully

1648
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,880
if the uh

1649
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,480
the the labor government which is you

1650
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,838
know a lot more progressive if they get

1651
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,760
in power hopefully something will happen

1652
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,119
but in terms of who's doing good things

1653
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,480
like the states you know like we were

1654
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,079
talking about with oregon kid you know

1655
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,159
there's there are some people who are

1656
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,599
just doing things at their own risk and

1657
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:09,920
just trying to help progress the scene

1658
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,838
in little ways and you know shout out to

1659
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,599
all the homies around australia who are

1660
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,920
doing their best to final hunt and to

1661
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,680
keep cuts and to share cuts around with

1662
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,599
their mates and whatnot because to me

1663
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:20,719
that's what is driving the scene at the

1664
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,960
moment because it feels like we're at a

1665
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,399
bit of a political stand still so

1666
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,920
well politically things are a little

1667
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,318
slow we can still progress the scene

1668
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,000
ourselves and do what you guys did find

1669
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,838
good strains grow good weed get it out

1670
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,760
to the people

1671
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:35,440
i i think a lot of what what what

1672
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,119
unfortunate you know um pushed the

1673
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,519
states over as far as that goes and i

1674
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:42,000
hate to say it but we passed cannabis on

1675
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,039
the backs of children essentially by i

1676
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,318
think that's that cbd and

1677
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,719
the the

1678
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:51,759
well say the discovery of it but the the

1679
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,959
science of it all and um you know the

1680
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,760
the medical

1681
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,000
uh the medical benefits clearly from cbd

1682
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,160
that although it's still a schedule one

1683
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,039
narcotic you know i mean uh cannabis it

1684
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:04,480
has this weird component called cbd

1685
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:05,920
that uh that has made it you know

1686
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,838
medically viable and i think the belief

1687
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,760
of that and and just the science behind

1688
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:11,039
it and how it's used and just about like

1689
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,040
i can't go into a store these days

1690
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,440
without seeing you know hand confused

1691
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:17,599
cbd infused

1692
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,679
and so i think that really helped push

1693
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,480
the whole cannabis as a plant over the

1694
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,239
top

1695
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,079
and that there was a medical viability

1696
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,679
behind it and maybe the government did

1697
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,119
lie to you for a long time

1698
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,318
yeah but

1699
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,599
so hopefully that you know i'm not

1700
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,679
saying hopefully but you know maybe that

1701
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,200
may may come to australia and help them

1702
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,679
pass it quicker because there's some

1703
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:38,239
serious you know cbg we know works is as

1704
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,838
a great component cbn we now know is

1705
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:42,639
like the night night as far as hemp goes

1706
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,318
and so hemp and hemp and cbd and whatnot

1707
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,558
have have a big value as a whole

1708
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,798
industry on them on their own and and

1709
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,559
millions of dollars and so maybe that

1710
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:53,199
helped us joyous see the see the light

1711
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,240
of day or so to say yeah fingers crossed

1712
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:55,519
you know we already see a little bit of

1713
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,798
it but yeah hopefully it gets over the

1714
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:59,358
line

1715
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,358

1717
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:04,000

1740
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,318
a lot of people who take for granted how

1741

wide your shipping service is and i know

1742
