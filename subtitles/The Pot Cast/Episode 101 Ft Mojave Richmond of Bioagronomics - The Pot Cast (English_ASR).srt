joining us today and as usual I want to

126
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,879
start off by asking what have you been

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,280
smoking on

128
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,959
lately o um actually I've been triing

129
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,519
out some or I've been testing out some

130
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:34,918
trial selections from um a project last

131
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:38,399
year with um group Haze Valley up in

132
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:42,478
Watsonville we did some crosses they're

133
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:47,399
Sage times um it's actually Zeta times

134
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:49,318
Kim diesel so um it's Sage OG chem and

135
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,318
Diesel and these are the f2s um some of

136
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,439
the selections um that's what I've been

137
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,360
puffing on lately but the thing that

138
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,959
I've been really enjoying is this

139
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Cambodian that came from Mel Frank um he

140
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,279
gifted me some seeds a few years back

141
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,000
and it's just super super nice like

142
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,799
really friendly all day approachable

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,079
just lovely

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,520
weed oh I'm I'm so so jealous I guess

145
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,800
like the first thing that jumps to mind

146
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,240
when I hear that is what sort of

147
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,439
qualities does a Cambodian bring because

148
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
I mean I I sadly haven't had a lot of

149
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,319
exposure and when I think about it the

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,839
only real call back to Cambodian I can

151
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,400
think of is you often heard about uh the

152
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,279
original C Mist seeds as like having

153
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,000
some amount of cambod in the maybe maybe

154
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,719
it was like sort of just Whispers but

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,560
maybe it was true but I'd love to hear

156
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,199
from you what's what's smoking a

157
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,879
Cambodian like and what sort of traits

158
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,520
and qualities does it bring to the table

159
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,560
in your

160
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,560
mind um well I can't say about the C

161
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Mist I haven't heard that before but

162
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,399
definitely I think C Mist was one of the

163
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
most exotic and really just amazing Cult

164
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,359
of ours with Once also really

165
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:04,839
approachable just elegant High um

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,960
this Cambodian is really interesting um

gave me these seeds a few years ago and

169
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,038
actually no first he gave me some flour

170
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,199
and it's you know narrow Leaf very

171
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:24,959
equatorial looking kind of similar um

172
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,560
minty SL spicy kind of Aroma um and this

173
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,758
one it had a really nice high really

174
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,079
nice effect but you know um Mel had

175
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,199
shared that you know you like yeah we

176
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,318
really like this and then he got it

177
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:39,639
analyzed and um it came back it was a

178
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:43,439
one:1 THC CBD which was really eye

179
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:46,560
openening for me because all the um I

180
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:51,199
typically don't like most CBD varieties

181
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,519
for one just you know my I guess um my

182
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,840
uh curiosity around CBD and whether how

183
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,959
effective it is and whether it's you

184
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,079
know modulating or you know mod you know

185
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,878
how it's impacting the overall High I

186
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,519
think is basically you know always been

187
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:08,800
my question in terms of you know how it

188
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,439
impacts THC but the the interesting part

189
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
here was that this was the first time I

190
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,519
had a onetoone variety that was

191
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:20,399
completely non Afghan derived it wasn't

192
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,839
ACDC Charlotte's Web um canonic from

193
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,598
that whole

194
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:31,399
pool so the overall profile was very um

195
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:33,360
narrow Leaf but it also had CBD so um

196
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,079
that kind of made me think about what

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,918
these one to ones were really like and

198
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,879
how much of the thing that I didn't like

199
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,718
about all the Wonder ones and the CBD

200
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,320
varieties as a whole was that they came

201
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,879
from this other pool with these other

202
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,360
traits in addition to being CBD because

203
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,799
I've never really been a big Afghan

204
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,440
consumer myself so that was interesting

205
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,079
but then and also it opened up the whole

206
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,000
discussion of whether you know is this

207
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,320
do I like do I like this Cambodian

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,440
because it's it's a one to one or do I

209
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,360
just like it because it's a low THC

210
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,360
variety because there's something about

211
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,759
you know these 10

212
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,800
12% THC varieties that are just

213
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,319
completely

214
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,599
approachable um compared to you know

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,040
higher THC varieties so but it's just

216
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,278
really nice it's really Pleasant smok's

217
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,799
really good and it's I'm just looking at

218
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,399
it right now and as it goes into later

219
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,359
into the fall it's putting on a lot of

220
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,078
really nice color so it's a nice

221
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,879
plan wow the I mean so many cool little

222
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:33,639
TP in there I mean first of all to to

223
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,958
get an equatorial that's putting on some

224
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,199
nice color I mean I always say to people

225
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,639
that it's a bit of a rarity to see that

226
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,000
which is really really interesting but I

227
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,199
want to probe a little bit deeper

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,278
quickly cuz I'm interested to go down

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,440
that line of thought about how it is a

230
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,120
like you know lower cannaboids so to

231
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,839
speak and there is the onetoone

232
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,639
component and yet it's still really

233
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,320
interesting and I think I share that

234
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,679
sort of thought you expressed about like

235
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,120
wondering over the years what is the CBD

236
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:05,679
actually doing is it is it just bringing

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,120
the high down like in a sort of in a in

238
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:12,439
a way that I'm not looking for peray um

239
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,200
but I'd love to hear your thoughts on

240
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,920
why do you think it's just that the fact

241
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,759
that like it's offering this unique

242
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,759
effects so the cannaboids don't need to

243
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,958
be so Sky High and as a bit of a

244
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:26,240
followup I've I've asked people for a

245
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,399
long time why is it that like land

246
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,560
Racers generally speaking don't have a

247
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,120
ceiling or less likely to you know a lot

248
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,599
of the modern strains you smoke them all

249
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,078
day and you sort of only get so far uh

250
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,480
but some of these older varieties

251
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,958
especially you know the one people talk

252
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,639
about is like Hayes and taii Mexican

253
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,399
some of the components of hay they're

254
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,680
like man you just you keep smoking it

255
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,839
you keep getting higher and higher and I

256
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,159
almost felt like you were sort of

257
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,800
getting to that point when you were

258
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:55,199
describing the Cambodian i' I'd love to

259
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,240
hear why do you feel that like some of

260
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,800
these uh land race varieties or more raw

261
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,360
sort of genetic building blocks have

262
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,078
that ability what what do you think

263
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,600
we've lost when we get to a point where

264
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,719
OG can't do

265
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,800
it well that well that's a really good

266
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,800
point and there's let me just back up

267
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:17,919
and just say that I when I say A

268
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,159
Cambodian variety you know nobody you

269
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,879
know there's there's level there's

270
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,679
degrees of um of you know how sure are

271
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,000
you that something is really what it's

272
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,120
supposed to be in terms of you know

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,039
germplasm right it's it came from

274
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,519
Cambodia that I can

275
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,399
I can say and the person who sourced it

276
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,919
got it from someone that they trust but

277
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,919
that doesn't mean that it has a whole

278
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,360
bunch of other things in there and maybe

279
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,278
that CBD component and the color

280
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,519
component came from Modern weed that has

281
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:50,120
been in Cambodia for decades so it's

282
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,839
always really hard to know um what you

283
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,440
know what really is you know and and

284
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,320
it's Cambodian derived and it has

285
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
Cambodian influence and it came from a

286
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Cambodian grower and that's all we can

287
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:05,559
really say about most modern germplasm

288
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,278
right um we we want you know I mean and

289
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,919
and hopefully through genomic work you

290
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,879
know we could you know we could un

291
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,919
unravel a little bit more of that but

292
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,039
it's still hard to do because we lost a

293
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,479
lot of the original data to reference

294
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:23,919
all the original reference points um but

295
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,199
uh and this on the the potency and the

296
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:30,039
ceiling thing I mean I don't know I just

297
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,078
you you know there's there's something

298
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,399
about how certain varieties burn burn

299
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,919
you out kind of is what I've always

300
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,519
noticed like certain things you need

301
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:42,799
like this recovery period and some I

302
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,839
mean someone once hypothesized that that

303
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,198
was like a hydroxy 11 thing that

304
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,959
overtime you're going to build up

305
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,838
hydroxy 11 in your system and you're

306
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:53,239
going to feel tired and lazy from just a

307
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,720
large dose of THC running through your

308
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,799
blood I don't know if that's it or if

309
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,120
it's an aroma profile thing something to

310
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:03,838
do with the Entourage but early on in in

311
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,639
my life I noticed that certain varieties

312
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,279
if you smoke them before another

313
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,959
variety um specifically you know like

314
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:15,838
more Afghan leaning things versus more

315
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:19,958
quote unquote sativa leaning that it

316
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,720
kind of like if you smoke um and this

317
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,439
this was my experience specifically with

318
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,320
like sage and OG um is that if you

319
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,560
smoked OG first it was really hard to

320
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,800
feel the effect of the sage afterwards

321
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,119
and it wasn't because there wasn't

322
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:37,159
enough potency in this age it was just

323
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,639
because there was something to the

324
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:43,360
effect of this other plant that put up

325
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,759
like a barrier and you can't you you the

326
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,519
only thing you can do to crush through

327
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:52,240
that barrier is to kind of reset maybe

328
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,360
your your um receptors so that they can

329
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,360
accept something new but it generally

330
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,720
takes time right like you you know

331
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,320
that's why people smoke cannabis in the

332
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,240
morning they got that wake and bake is

333
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,240
because they got that fresh you know

334
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,120
receptor um you know effect so I've

335
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
always wondered if there was something

336
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,320
in these other varieties that have no

337
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,559
ceiling quote unquote No ceiling in that

338
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,079
the the onset of the effect and the way

339
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,638
you're accumulating it in your body just

340
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,479
never creates this big wall that you

341
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,480
can't get through so you can keep kind

342
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,000
of stacking and stacking on it because

343
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,440
it's an uplifting you know all those

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,198
varieties that were quote unquote

345
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,839
seiling lless you know they are tend to

346
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:39,719
be you know uplifting varieties um so

347
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,639
they got a little bit more of that so um

348
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,800
you're not having to break through the

349
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,720
fog you know so to speak of something

350
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,399
that really puts you out but um but

351
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,199
there's also there is some kind of

352
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,559
common effect you know and i' one

353
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,039
interesting thing that I've notic is

354
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,479
that people at times have assumed that

355
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,240
some of the cultiv ours that I've um

356
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,120
developed or presented are lower potency

357
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,680
than they

358
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,759
are that like oh this feels like a 177%

359
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,479
variety where they're actually like

360
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,519
25% because it's such a different

361
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,199
feeling that people are assumed to

362
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,600
because like and racy varieties you know

363
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,519
are like racy and uplifting until

364
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,959
they're not right and then they're

365
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,639
harder to perceive versus just something

366
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:30,518
that just puts you in your chair um so

367
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,278
it's like uh yeah I I don't know it's

368
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,600
it's I think it's puzzling and but

369
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,198
there's but there's so much more to

370
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,959
potency I think is the real question

371
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,879
here is like what is potency we really

372
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:45,559
don't have a handle on it because it's

373
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:49,679
not just like alcohol where you can

374
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:53,958
drink um two or three you can drink a a

375
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:56,318
5% beer you can drink four of those and

376
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,518
or you can drink two 10% beers and

377
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,360
you're going to have the same effect but

378
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,639
with can there seems to be some type of

379
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,360
a Time duration thing where the onset of

380
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,959
the effect is going through this kind of

381
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:14,159
this Arc and what you put on it after

382
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:16,799
that is also having an impact so it's

383
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,759
not just a simple as stacking the

384
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,159
potency you would the way you would with

385
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:25,278
like ethanol so like what all the other

386
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:28,439
compounds that are in play are shaping

387
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:31,919
the effect of that you know the whatever

388
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,839
it is that is potency so I mean to me

389
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,519
that that that's that's why you know you

390
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,399
you hear people smoking sativas in the

391
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,039
morning and indicas at night is because

392
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,958
it's not just because sativas are

393
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:46,958
appropriate for morning which they they

394
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,239
are because they're less lethargic and

395
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,198
you know sleepy and disassociative but

396
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,879
it's also that you can keep smoking

397
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,120
sativas through the day and then in the

398
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,078
night with indicas and you still have

399
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,318
kind of a functioning

400
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:03,758
effect whereas if you smoke heavy

401
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:06,119
indicas all day and then you turn to

402
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,120
that sativa that beautiful C Mist

403
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,159
elegant high at night it like it doesn't

404
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,159
cut through you know you you've got

405
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,120
you've got to like you got like cut

406
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,120
through with like a a a chisel you know

407
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:22,119
to get through the wall that you put up

408
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,958
and um and maybe that chisel was

409
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,078
increasing the potency and that's why

410
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,199
people you know smoke Dabs and all this

411
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,759
other stuff because it's like you're now

412
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:34,279
forcing the high but when you're when

413
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:37,919
your tolerance is fairly low um

414
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:40,639
obviously you need less but um it's just

415
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,520
anyway I I guess back to the to the the

416
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,200
ceiling thing I I don't think we even

417
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,079
know we can't even look at what a

418
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,080
ceiling is until we really address what

419
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:53,558
potency is and that's that's just so so

420
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,199
complicated right totally look you given

421
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:59,000
me so many good Avenues I could I could

422
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,759
dive off into and I guess the the the

423
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,319
first one I wanted to ask you is it's

424
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,919
sort of like a twof folder but the first

425
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,359
one is I'd be interested to hear how

426
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,038
your relationship with tolerance and

427
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:13,038
smoking might have changed over time I

428
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,440
certainly am going through a bit of a

429
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,480
transitionary phase as I was mentioning

430
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,558
to you a bit earlier like I've got some

431
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,079
kids now so I find like I'm pretty

432
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,678
consistently not smoking until later in

433
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,158
the day and then through doing that as

434
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,400
you were just talking about you know

435
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,720
your tolerance changes significantly and

436
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,679
then for me personally I found myself

437
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,279
enjoying these strains that I used to

438
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,440
think were kind of a bit tame maybe back

439
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,158
when I was smoking you know more heavy

440
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,840
chem stuff From Dawn till Dusk so I'd

441
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,880
love to hear you know how has your sort

442
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,439
of relationship with tolerance changed

443
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,559
over time and as a follow on and this is

444
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,360
probably the one where there's a bit

445
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:52,798
more meat on the bone but we often hear

446
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:56,599
people talk about being really fond of

447
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,798
strains in the old days and they'll say

448
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:00,678
look I had this cut of let's just for

449
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,440
for just easy discussion sake we say

450
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,480
look I have this uh this purple urle I

451
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,640
used to grow it all the time it was the

452
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,720
dopest stuff ever and then nowadays I

453
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
grow it same cut it's definitely not a

454
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,519
different cut and uh it's just not

455
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,759
hitting the same but like I swear to God

456
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,759
it was really good and put aside all the

457
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,279
other factors that could be at play I

458
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,839
guess what I'm wondering is is people

459
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,319
talk about this idea of like well why

460
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,119
why did it seem so much better back 20

461
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,798
years ago ago and one of the reasons we

462
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,719
hear people talk about is that maybe it

463
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,119
was the case that you know on average

464
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,159
the weed wasn't as good so like you'd go

465
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,918
through these periods where you'd have

466
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,360
not the best weed and then so when you

467
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,000
did get something good like it was

468
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,359
really memorable but then nowadays when

469
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,279
you grow that same thing it doesn't

470
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,119
really strike you as particularly

471
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,879
memorable to me that's one of the best

472
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,279
explanations I've heard you know like

473
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm sure that if you were smoking brick

474
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,599
weed when you got anything that was half

475
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,519
good you know it' be quite memorable but

476
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,719
at the same time I'd love to hear your

477
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,359
thoughts on why do you think that has

478
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,600
changed you know are strains getting

479
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,319
weaker are we just used to Stronger

480
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:14,719
stuff how is our relationship with

481
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:19,279
tolerance evolved as a

482
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,240
community that is a fantastic question I

483
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,759
think it's really important because you

484
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,798
know we are coming out of prohibition

485
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,759
and we are reintroducing ourselves to

486
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:32,720
cannabis in a big way on a global scale

487
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,919
and you know how people consume

488
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,000
substances is relevant you know whether

489
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:41,919
it's coffee or alcohol or sugar or

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,720
cannabis right um I have a particularly

491
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,038
long relationship with consuming

492
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,120
cannabis I would say I mean I'm 54 years

493
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:53,519
old and I've probably been consuming for

494
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,918
55 years um just because I grew up in a

495
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,918
world where cannabis was already

496
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:01,200
normalized and it was always

497
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:03,799
around um and but that being said it

498
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,360
wasn't always potent it wasn't always

499
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,359
around um it was always there but not in

500
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,199
the quantities that most consumers

501
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,000
wanted it to be in or in the potency or

502
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,798
the quality so we are now having this

503
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,839
Renaissance of availability and I and I

504
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:22,158
do think that that has shaped our

505
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:24,558
tolerance in a big way that even us you

506
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,640
know people who always had access or

507
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:31,158
relative amount of access never could

508
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,440
just turn to the left and open a jar of

509
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,679
some of the finest grown amazing

510
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,038
genetics in the world anytime they want

511
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,400
you know so we've all we've all upped

512
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:46,000
our tolerance for sure you know and that

513
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,120
has changed the way a classic cultivar

514
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,319
works the way you remember it because

515
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,599
none of us and you know we've also

516
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:56,519
increased our our our skill as a um

517
00:21:53,599 --> 00:22:00,918
cultivators so I mean I'm looking back

518
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,599
at Sage that I grew 30 years ago and

519
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,320
thinking about how I grew it and under

520
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,038
what kind of gear and what type of

521
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,399
environmental controls and thinking like

522
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:09,200
wow what would what would that have been

523
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,278
like if I could grow that same plant

524
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,558
today right now you know would have

525
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:17,480
expressed itself higher or what um but

526
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:19,158
that also expressed higher in what

527
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,400
that's also back to the the potency

528
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,840
thing but um but I do think cannabis has

529
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,640
been potent for a long time I do think

530
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,278
that I don't think that

531
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,400
we've I think there's this conception

532
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:35,319
that we've bred higher potency

533
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,400
cannabis that as an industry that we've

534
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:40,480
kind of Franken that this Franken weed

535
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,038
that we've our lab breeders went down in

536
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
the underground and we took 6% cannabis

537
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,200
that was you know what they were saying

538
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,759
based off of seizures that you know we

539
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,319
took it and wrote it up to 30% I think

540
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:56,759
that's a fallacy and a misconception

541
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:59,798
about how modern potency works that to

542
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,720
me in even in in land race based

543
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,278
populations if you went through enough

544
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,640
seeds you'd find outliers of all

545
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:10,599
different potency ranges right and some

546
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,880
of the the outliers that impacted modern

547
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:17,599
cannabis are pretty old and and arguably

548
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:21,520
not even that far from their land race

549
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:24,480
um source so bag seed that was imported

550
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,440
crossed a couple times and then seeds

551
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,079
reproduced right not decades and Decades

552
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,798
of of um

553
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:34,119
of breeding right and remember back in

554
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,240
the day we didn't grow or breed indoors

555
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,959
we did it seasonally so you only had one

556
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,240
selection a year so it it we didn't

557
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,240
basically to me what happened is that

558
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,519
the we we learned how to clone and when

559
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,200
people selected really potent

560
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,639
cultivars we saved them and then we

561
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,558
shared them with the world and in doing

562
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:01,278
that we shared High potency THC

563
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:04,119
genes you know that that that whatever

564
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,919
that THC synthes you know ramped up

565
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:09,719
however you know to the world but is

566
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,960
that breeding or is that selection or is

567
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,278
that distribution is that you know

568
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:19,759
disseminating founder cultivars that

569
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:22,159
brought those traits we didn't take 6%

570
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:26,158
THC and make it seven then eight then 10

571
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:29,600
then 12 then 14 then 20 then 22 then 24

572
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,080
it was people found boom whoa that stuff

573
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,558
is amazing it's potent and they shared

574
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,278
it with everybody so then everybody had

575
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,720
material to use breeding material to use

576
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,278
to ramp up their potency and that wasn't

577
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,839
through breeding that was through

578
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,558
cloning and sharing

579
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,798
clones in in my opinion that's the way I

580
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:52,000
I saw it and I mean I know that the sage

581
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:57,038
that was tested in

582
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,839
1998 tested at 21 point something per

583
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:04,038
THC um and that stuff was you know my

584
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,918
breeding effort wasn't a big giant you

585
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:08,720
know project it was me making a few

586
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,759
selections from things that you know

587
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,759
were either in the ecosystem and also

588
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:16,119
things that I brought back from from

589
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:19,679
Cali but it you know I'm just saying 30

590
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:23,038
years ago we had 20 plus per clones that

591
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,240
were going around and in my experience

592
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,679
growing cannabis over I mean consuming

593
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,319
cannabis throughout my whole life is

594
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,600
that every now and then you encountered

595
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,200
some flower that knocked you out but

596
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:36,599
just really strong and another thing

597
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,278
that is really sometimes overlooked

598
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:43,278
about you know um potency and people

599
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,640
waxing poetic about the flower they

600
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:49,798
smoked in the past is that in a a pound

601
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,600
of cannabis in the 70s and 80s and 90s

602
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,839
for one it was almost all grown from

603
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,398
seed but it wasn't one plant if you got

604
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,720
a pound of cannabis or multiple you know

605
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:02,879
large amounts of can it was homogenized

606
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,839
batches of a bunch of different seed

607
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,919
plants so you could have a 100 different

608
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:12,398
plants in one batch all mixed so you

609
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,799
weren't if you if someone a consumer

610
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:17,798
bought an ounce of cannabis at the dead

611
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:20,480
lot before clones were going

612
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:24,119
around that 1 ounce could have had

613
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,720
multiple um you know plants in it some

614
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,359
of them were incredibly potent and some

615
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,240
of them weren't so it was always this

616
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,240
kind of weird like every now and then

617
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,278
you'd have this potent experience with

618
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,798
cannabis and just go like oh my god do

619
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:38,240
you remember that time we smoked that

620
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:40,079
one thing and and I do believe that

621
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,278
those were potent varieties and they

622
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,398
were probably also very high in THC but

623
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,278
you didn't

624
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:50,038
get five pounds of cannabis from someone

625
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:55,200
in the 70s 80s and 90s that was all the

626
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:58,398
same 25% THC clone grown the same you

627
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,679
know beautifully cared for so to have

628
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:04,479
that consistent potent experience was

629
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,519
really rare even even when you had good

630
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,079
flour you were still fishing through you

631
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:13,918
know the the PO Perri or the mage of all

632
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:16,558
the different seed plants so just you're

633
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,720
just the ability to like in interact

634
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:23,278
with that much consistent High potency

635
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,159
quality cannabis is super super new I

636
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,599
mean I would argue it's only 5 to 10

637
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,840
years old for most of the world I mean

638
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:33,798
even in California you know 20 years ago

639
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,158
you there was really amazing flower but

640
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:39,480
it wasn't always everywhere and it

641
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,240
wasn't always grown really well so I

642
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,319
mean we're we're we're definitely in

643
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,359
this new new um realm of what is you

644
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,158
know what our tolerance levels are and

645
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,000
what what our consumption habits should

646
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:55,159
be in order to reflect our tolerance you

647
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,720
know to consume it both in it's safe and

648
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,120
productive but also to get the most

649
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,159
benefit

650
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:04,199
and I think that's really what the

651
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,919
tolerance discussion kind of speaks to

652
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,640
is where does the most benefit for the

653
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,919
consumer lie because that really when

654
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,840
you have a high tolerance and you do

655
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,200
small amounts you it's very potent um

656
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,000
but you are consuming less and you could

657
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,558
argue that you know consuming more of

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,519
that substance might be beneficial for

659
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:27,079
you for whatever reasons for pain relief

660
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,759
or stress or or you know um inflammation

661
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,599
or whatever if it's a medicinal reason

662
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,319
or if it's just you know um wanting to

663
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,480
have a higher tolerance so that you

664
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:39,519
don't have any of the um um the negative

665
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,440
side effects associated with cannabis

666
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,919
and that's definitely something that you

667
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,360
could say that people who consume more

668
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:49,759
can consume more where people who

669
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,678
consume less have to be very careful

670
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,919
about when they're consuming because it

671
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,919
can really knock you

672
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,159
out yeah totally totally I mean I can I

673
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,759
can so deeply relate to what you just

674
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,039
said as I was uh sort of explaining my

675
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,919
my own relationship with consumption and

676
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:09,200
tolerance is changing and you know gosh

677
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,600
I tell you what I I feel the munchies

678
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,120
these days in a way that I didn't not so

679
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,918
long ago and it's it's it's so

680
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,918
interesting because your own personal

681
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,480
relationship with cannabis can often cuz

682
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,880
we are you know we are so far in like

683
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,919
the top one percentile of consumers I

684
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,278
often say like you know anyone listening

685
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,278
to this show right now like you're in

686
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,359
the top 1% all like no one else is going

687
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:35,519
to listen to this and it it can become

688
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,398
very um like atypical I guess what I

689
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,359
realized when I took a tolerance break

690
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:43,119
recently was that I became extremely

691
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,759
lazy like basically I would I'd get home

692
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,639
from work and want to do something and

693
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,398
I'd just be like Oh I'm tired and then I

694
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,600
realized in those moments I would smoke

695
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,918
a sativa and have the energy to go do

696
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,678
that thing and I thought it was such an

697
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,640
interesting sort of observation because

698
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,320
you know so often the conversation is

699
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,240
like oh oh you know Stoners no

700
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,960
motivation no energy and and in that

701
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,919
moment I realized I was actually the

702
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,079
opposite I was finding myself more lazy

703
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,600
without it but I mean that sort of

704
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:15,439
brings us to the discussion about

705
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:17,158
sativas and I'm someone who used to not

706
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,159
be able to consume them I would just get

707
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,080
so

708
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,720
anxious and then I don't honestly know

709
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,319
when but at some point I sort of just

710
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,360
checked back in this is over the course

711
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,798
of years I checked back in and I sort of

712
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,798
felt like I could ride that horse a

713
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,839
little better and now we're at the point

714
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,558
and all of our listeners will know where

715
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,278
I I just love it it's my favorite

716
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:41,639
sativas what I'd love to ask you as

717
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:44,240
someone who's got you know a rich and

718
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,200
wide experience with a range of sativas

719
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,640
including many of the building block

720
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,720
land races that we're all so you know

721
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Keen to

722
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,720
try how do you think we can help expose

723
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,320
a wider audience to the beauty of

724
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,360
sativas because part of me thinks that

725
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:07,319
uh a lot of people a aren't aware of the

726
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:09,479
creative and stimulative and you know

727
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,439
all these unique effects that sativas

728
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,720
bring you know so often people are like

729
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,320
well I just thought it was sedating how

730
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,440
do we how do we get the message out

731
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,839
there and as as we've sort of been

732
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,159
talking you know it doesn't need to be a

733
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:26,079
28% OG it could be a 15% sativa and

734
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,960
it'll it'll take you somewhere totally

735
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,678
different how do we try to get that

736
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,759
message out there or how do we just

737
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,480
raise awareness in

738
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:38,398
general um well Ju Just and and just I

739
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:42,200
have to say for my for my taxonomy

740
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:44,759
Brethren and stuff that you know um for

741
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,200
for really this is for you rob um

742
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,798
cannabis indicia subspecies indicia

743
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,600
right we're talking about narrow Leaf

744
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:56,278
varieties and that we colloquially call

745
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,278
sativa um but I think it's important I

746
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:00,319
think it's I think and I also you know I

747
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:01,798
love the word sativa so I'm happy to I

748
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,558
think it's a great you know it's it's

749
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:07,839
part of the the you know we the word

750
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,319
strain as opposed to Cult of art

751
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,359
sometimes you just have to accept that

752
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,038
it doesn't really have to have the the

753
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,199
science the meaning behind it for it to

754
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,638
have the impact right and so I love

755
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,038
using the word sativa again more and

756
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:25,038
more um but

757
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:28,679
um if you think about what people wanted

758
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:30,038
cannabis to be like what

759
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,399
and I know that I'm going to like go

760
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:34,720
deep down in the rabbit hole of you know

761
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,558
humanity and you know our relationship

762
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,720
with this plant um because it is a weird

763
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:42,558
one right you know the the

764
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,278
endocannabinoid system was in us it was

765
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,359
in our family tree before it was in the

766
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,159
plants family tree right it we it goes

767
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,038
back further in in animals than it does

768
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:58,200
in plants so it's kind of cool how we

769
00:32:53,038 --> 00:33:01,038
how we met um but if you look at all

770
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,440
cannabis around the world you know up

771
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:07,278
until

772
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:09,440
before um before the 80s really it was

773
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,240
mostly these narrow Leaf varieties these

774
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,240
kind of Equatorial tropical varieties

775
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,759
you know if you think about Thai Thai

776
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:23,440
cannabis and you know um Indian and um

777
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:27,638
you know Vietnamese Cambodian um African

778
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,200
South African you know Mala um Tanzania

779
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:33,839
um you think of South America you know

780
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,919
Colombia and Panama and Mexico and

781
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,480
Jamaica and you think of all these

782
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,600
places and all these selections that

783
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,399
happened over a long amount of time sure

784
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,319
they all I'm sure came from somewhat of

785
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,678
a narrow gene pool because it was an

786
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:51,278
export commodity as well but people were

787
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:54,120
selecting cannabis to be something for a

788
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:56,240
long time right and they were working

789
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,479
within whatever population they had but

790
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,919
these populations are dynamic

791
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,440
and there's the ability to move the

792
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,320
needle left or right and kind of steer

793
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,960
the selection how you want it steer the

794
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:10,279
gene pool and for whatever reason they

795
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,358
steered it towards these you know

796
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,760
electric uplifting psychedelic soaring

797
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:18,679
energizing um varieties that were also

798
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,320
potent and had you know all lots of

799
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,838
other attributes too but that is kind of

800
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,159
what we think of these varieties as for

801
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:28,440
being these sativas you know these

802
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,480
narrowly

803
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:36,838
varieties and if you think about how the

804
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,639
the other class the the Afghan the

805
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:41,799
indicia um chemotype if that's

806
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,440
appropriate and I'm not a scientist or

807
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,440
anything so I forgive me if I you misuse

808
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,079
any terms um I'm just kind of an

809
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,398
observer and I hang out with a lot of

810
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,960
cool scientists so I have been gifted

811
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:57,239
some cool knowledge but um if you think

812
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,880
about how that entered the gene pool um

813
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,559
at least from my perspective you know

814
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,440
growing up in California and having

815
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:10,159
family that grew cannabis in Big Sur for

816
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:14,559
instance is that Afghan gave them the

817
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:18,159
ability to grow a shorter plant that um

818
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,920
that they could hide um in the brush it

819
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,118
gave them the ability to grow an earlier

820
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,280
flowering plant that they could Harvest

821
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,119
before um you know some climate issues

822
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,920
but also Harvest before initially

823
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,838
Harvest before Camp came and started

824
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,400
seizing plants and it gave a variety

825
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:38,480
that you could grow indoors which was

826
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,440
also about evading law enforcement um it

827
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,400
gave you a variety that was more potent

828
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,720
you know but it wasn't about people

829
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,280
weren't going in my experience like oh

830
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:52,480
wow the effects of this new um this new

831
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,800
Afghan stuff is so amazing we now want

832
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,719
to feel this way it wasn't like all the

833
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,720
Breeders and Growers were select in for

834
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,519
these new

835
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:06,239
traits they were they were happy with

836
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:09,000
the sativas they were growing before and

837
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,879
they just took on all these new traits

838
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,199
because they were agronomically friendly

839
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,920
they helped evade law enforcement blah

840
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,480
blah

841
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,639
blah um and it's important to kind of to

842
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,679
draw the comparison between all these

843
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:26,000
traditional Farmers around the world

844
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:28,719
that grew and smoked flour versus um a

845
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,159
hash producing region like

846
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:35,559
Afghanistan so if you're you know a

847
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,598
small farmer you know growing your your

848
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,799
small plot of cannabis or just Grows by

849
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,359
you wherever and You observe an amazing

850
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,960
plant um and you consume that plant as

851
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:49,759
CIA or as

852
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,199
flow um and the seeds fall out you go

853
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,480
wow that's amazing flower I'm going to

854
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,039
keep these seeds and I'm going to grow

855
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,039
it again next year right that's just

856
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,800
that's how Farmers work so you're cting

857
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,239
from an individual

858
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,640
plant so you get to interface with the

859
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,919
plant you get to you get to consume the

860
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,879
plant and then you get to decide whether

861
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,000
it fits in with what you want where you

862
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,280
your expectations were and then you grow

863
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,199
with it or you breed with it or you

864
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,519
continue down that line but in a hash

865
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:23,598
making culture like in Afghanistan they

866
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,559
don't consume individual plants you know

867
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,160
or I imagine it happens very rarely so

868
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,159
you're taking a whole field and you're

869
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,358
homogenizing that and then you're going

870
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:37,078
through you're you're drying it in the

871
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:39,440
sun and then you're aging it and then

872
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,560
you're sving it and agitating it and

873
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,039
then you're pressing it often with heat

874
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:47,078
and then you're drying it some more and

875
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:49,079
then you're consuming it so your only

876
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,000
real selections are for like resin

877
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:56,599
content and like you know higher yields

878
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,199
of API of you know that that active

879
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,440
ingredient that you're putting into your

880
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:02,759
hash so you're not selecting for

881
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,760
individual plants so you're never

882
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,960
selecting for those individual

883
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,800
traits and you're not selecting for

884
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,599
individual plant traits you're selecting

885
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,359
for

886
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,400
hash you know

887
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:18,440
so we kind of snuck in all these genes

888
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,838
and all these traits and all this

889
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:25,880
chemistry and compounds and things and

890
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:29,000
into our gene pool really quickly

891
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,000
worldwide and I'm just I question why we

892
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,440
did that you know

893
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,400
because it it wasn't necessarily just

894
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,639
for their for the

895
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,760
effect and then at the same time because

896
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:44,440
they these hybrids and stuff were so

897
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,480
much more agronomically valuable really

898
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,639
than these narly varieties just because

899
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,240
how the yield and all the sativas fell

900
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:53,799
out of favor because they couldn't

901
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,879
compete but it wasn't on

902
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,160
effect and then we slowly turned into

903
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,280
just a complete completely different

904
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:06,318
cannabis consuming culture you know um

905
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:09,519
and now I mean I I don't you know it's I

906
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:12,519
guess it's just it's um anecdotal to say

907
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,599
that at the same time that modern

908
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:18,159
cannabis exploded out of prohibition we

909
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:20,240
are in a weird disassociative State as a

910
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,519
as a people around the world people are

911
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,399
more Tapped Out than ever um people are

912
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,960
also more anxious than ever they don't

913
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,639
need to have any anxiety induc ing

914
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,199
substances in their lives um so and

915
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,039
there's I mean if you look at opioid

916
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,960
crisis and all this stuff you know

917
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,000
people maybe in some weird way I hate to

918
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,240
think it's this this is true but in some

919
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,519
weird way as we're now we were Shifting

920
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,598
the gene pool away from these narrowleaf

921
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:48,719
varieties into this hybrid model we were

922
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,519
also

923
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:54,159
shifting what the drug was being used

924
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:57,440
for which was no longer about

925
00:39:54,159 --> 00:40:00,118
celebration and insightfulness and mind

926
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,240
expansion and Community it was about

927
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,280
accommodating a new culture of people

928
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:09,479
who were tapped out and disassociated

929
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,960
and need to just be numb as much as

930
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,079
possible you know and then when you do

931
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,358
introduce sativas to people and they do

932
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,880
sometimes have a negative um

933
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,000
reaction I mean maybe that's part of of

934
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,760
the symptom of you know why is it why is

935
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,039
it hitting that vein now in our lives in

936
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,000
ways that it didn't before

937
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:33,639
um and and I mean that is I mean if that

938
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,239
is one of the inherent risks with with

939
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:39,078
cannabis use is you know that you people

940
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:42,439
can it can they can have negative side

941
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,119
effects but it's also the risk of a lot

942
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,358
of other therapeutic

943
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,760
substances um it doesn't mean that they

944
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:53,239
don't have value it just means you have

945
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,200
to proceed cautiously so I kind of feel

946
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:59,118
like when we when people have a negative

947
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:01,199
effect from assuming a sativa that spins

948
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,680
them out and they have like a slight

949
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,318
panic attack or they have that Tac

950
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:08,279
cardia thing they create these

951
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:10,880
associations with that negative moment

952
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,440
that carry on into their regular

953
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,680
consumption where if you were just a

954
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,318
little bit more mindful or maybe you

955
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,559
know your set and setting wasn't right

956
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:21,960
or you just accept that hey [ __ ] happens

957
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,759
in life then you can continue to consume

958
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,119
these sativas because they do deliver

959
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,520
this other thing you know and like you

960
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,318
said earlier you know um if you think

961
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:36,280
about how people's lives were in the

962
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:39,559
past when what what what they needed

963
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,960
cannabis to be for them you know and not

964
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:45,199
30 years ago but 300 years ago you know

965
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,400
you you people don't have the luxury to

966
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,759
just sit around and do nothing you know

967
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,559
life happens you've got to get out there

968
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,359
you got to go on the hunt you've got to

969
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:57,358
go and forage for food you've got to go

970
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:59,920
and collect firewood you've got to dance

971
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,598
all night long and celebrate and worship

972
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,639
and do all the far out things that being

973
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,960
human is so I think people were

974
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:11,440
selecting plants that facilitated that

975
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,559
in their life and if you took that out

976
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,159
of their

977
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:18,639
lives then there's no need for that

978
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:20,199
anymore right so so what are we having a

979
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,679
discussion about why we should have

980
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:26,480
sativas in our life is probably also a

981
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:29,879
reason for why we should have all the

982
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,719
other things sativas so you know

983
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:37,280
accommodate or or you know um go side by

984
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:39,799
side with but yeah I'm I'm a big fan I

985
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,599
am and and you know I really I I think

986
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,519
cannabis can be a lot of things for a

987
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,760
lot of people um and that's the beauty

988
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:49,199
of it that's what makes it so

989
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,040
complicated and complex and interesting

990
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,239
but like you like you you mentioned the

991
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:58,960
the 1% it's like but cannabis is for

992
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:02,358
everybody it's just the one % that is so

993
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,639
involved in shaping what

994
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:08,000
everybody sees cannabis as or or or you

995
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,759
know delivering cannabis to the

996
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,838
99% so it's like we have this

997
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:17,760
responsibility almost like an ethical

998
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:22,920
responsibility to help them get to the

999
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,720
right place right which is to me is

1000
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,440
really important because

1001
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,639
we if you think about if every everyone

1002
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,720
was consuming more sativas versus more

1003
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:33,838
hybrids and more you know Afghani

1004
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:36,558
varieties people's lives would be

1005
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,039
different what that means who knows but

1006
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,119
it does mean it would be different

1007
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,639
because like you said you'd get up and

1008
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,440
go do the cleaning you'd get [ __ ] done

1009
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:48,960
you

1010
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,960
know yeah no it's I mean I before I

1011
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,519
forget first point apologies Rob for the

1012
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,519
uh incorrect

1013
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:58,358
nomenclature it's it's it's such a

1014
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:00,759
conundrum isn't it because I always

1015
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:02,920
think to myself well I use the word

1016
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,520
sativa because I'm just wanting the

1017
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,079
person I'm talking to to understand like

1018
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,280
you know we're using the same term

1019
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,880
essentially and then you think oh okay

1020
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,440
so what really I'm saying is is when a

1021
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,480
majority of people adopt the new

1022
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,559
nomenclature then I'll do it because

1023
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,519
then we'll be talking the same language

1024
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,720
so to speak and then so then I feel

1025
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,119
guilty and I'm like oh so I'm not being

1026
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,039
part of the

1027
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,680
solution um but anyway we'll uh we'll

1028
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:31,759
get there one day my apologies but um I

1029
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:34,480
I guess just to continue that train of

1030
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,440
thought a bit more forward I I wanted to

1031
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,358
ask you um like how do you see the mode

1032
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,318
of delivery of cannabis as because you

1033
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:46,920
were talking about how the way in which

1034
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,838
we've consuming it and the the needs

1035
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,440
have changed over say 300 years which

1036
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,799
undeniably true and I guess just over

1037
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,480
the next like 50 years like I can't help

1038
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,280
but feel like I don't want to say like

1039
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,000
it's following the path of alcohol but

1040
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,079
in a certain sense we're seeing like the

1041
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,838
The more mass appealing more economical

1042
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,119
option in this space you often hear

1043
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:12,759
people saying like look it seems

1044
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:17,000
undeniable The Vape patterns are sort of

1045
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,760
filling that space and heck even I meet

1046
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,239
people all the time who like were not

1047
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,839
really cannabis people who have now got

1048
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:25,399
a vape pen so handy so discreet all

1049
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:28,480
these beneficial things and I guess what

1050
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,160
It ultimately leads me wondering is is

1051
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,719
it going to be like what I fear cuz as

1052
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,799
as like a breeder myself I I fear that

1053
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,519
loss of genetic diversity and you know

1054
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,400
we we all fear this but I I worry that

1055
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:44,119
it's going to become like wine where

1056
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,039
it's like we narrow ourselves down to

1057
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,880
like these 40 or so accepted varieties

1058
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,239
and even within those 40 there's just

1059
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,519
like five that get used most of the time

1060
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:55,679
and I can't help but feel we're

1061
00:45:53,519 --> 00:46:00,199
following down that same path where you

1062
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:02,318
know OG's shard and Run's cab saav and

1063
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:05,439
just with those two alone you've covered

1064
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,960
a huge swath of consumers in terms of

1065
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,679
they're like yep I'll happily take that

1066
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,039
um and I know obviously it's a bit of a

1067
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:15,358
stretch in terms of an analogy but I

1068
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,358
think there are some elements that are

1069
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,679
you know

1070
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,920
comparisons uh I I'd love to hear what

1071
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,279
what's your thoughts on the future

1072
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,920
delivery and do you think we might

1073
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,920
follow a similar model where we get to

1074
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,639
this point where it is just a small

1075
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,720
handful of accepted ver

1076
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,159
Idols well I think I mean the one thing

1077
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:40,159
that's always going to be different for

1078
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:42,199
cannabis and and wine is wine all the

1079
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:43,039
diversity in wine is just around flavor

1080
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,239
and

1081
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:49,079
Aroma it's all just

1082
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:52,919
ethanol so there's no chemical diversity

1083
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,720
in terms of the drug side of wine you

1084
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,119
know maybe a little bit you could argue

1085
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,639
that you know some some different types

1086
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,838
of alcohol have a slightly different

1087
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:03,759
effect whether it's whiskey or vodka or

1088
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:05,000
wine or beer um there's obviously a lot

1089
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,319
going on there's a lot of chemistry

1090
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,559
there but the main driver is one single

1091
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:13,000
thing so cannabis will always be more

1092
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:13,839
complicated than that in that there's a

1093
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,119
lot of

1094
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:19,279
drivers um to to to create this effect

1095
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,358
which we still don't fully understand

1096
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,839
but I think the the issue is and why I

1097
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,639
do think it will follow like wine and I

1098
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,440
think it'll follow like a lot of other

1099
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:32,960
products or commod agricultural

1100
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:37,880
Commodities is that you can't create a

1101
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:40,760
functioning supply chain with that much

1102
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,480
diversity and so so it's like it's not

1103
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,800
about the diversity in the gene pool

1104
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,559
it's about the diversity in the supply

1105
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,079
chain which ultimately means the

1106
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,599
selection of the

1107
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:56,400
consumer right so there's this whole

1108
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,318
Paradox of choice thing where if you

1109
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,160
give people too many choices they can't

1110
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:03,279
make a selection analysis paralysis

1111
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:05,078
where it's just like I don't know what

1112
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,400
to choose because it's just I just see

1113
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:08,280
too many stars it's like picking out a

1114
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,280
star in the Milky

1115
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,440
Way and I think that with cannabis more

1116
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,160
than any other crop especially

1117
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,960
considering it's the top crop you know

1118
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,358
in a state like California or in the US

1119
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:25,119
you know is that the farmer has to pick

1120
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:28,119
from thousands of cultivars essentially

1121
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:31,039
um and the distributor has to decide

1122
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:33,119
what to purchase the retail has to

1123
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,838
describe you know decide what to put on

1124
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:41,519
the shelf and then the consumer has to

1125
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:44,880
decide what to purchase um and it's like

1126
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:47,039
there's you it just it it crashes the

1127
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,358
whole system falls apart and then the

1128
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,199
other thing is like and the farmer has

1129
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:53,798
to do this every cycle every or every

1130
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,919
year it's because it keep keeps changing

1131
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:58,400
there's no Foundation to grow on there's

1132
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,400
no like people don't grow the same Cult

1133
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,838
of our four years in a row in four

1134
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,880
different places in the US in order to

1135
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:08,519
have like agronomic data on how it grows

1136
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,480
well or to you know to you know even for

1137
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,400
breeding to exist like breeding you know

1138
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,960
improving crop Improvement is about you

1139
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,440
you got to select the crop first and

1140
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,358
then improve it you know if you spend

1141
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,358
five years breeding a cultivar that

1142
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:24,798
nobody wants anymore then that you know

1143
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:26,119
so so that to me is the issue is like

1144
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:28,798
you know you want to maintain the

1145
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:30,240
diversity in the gene pool and you want

1146
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:32,838
to make sure that you always have the

1147
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,558
ability to Pivot and all the the

1148
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:36,759
complexity and all the chemistry is

1149
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,440
represented in the gene pool but at the

1150
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,200
same time you want to drive products to

1151
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:44,559
the consumer in a way that meets their

1152
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:46,239
needs and demands right and while doing

1153
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,400
that you want to create a functioning

1154
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,679
supply chain so that the farmer can feed

1155
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,960
their family and the retail Shop is open

1156
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:58,480
and everyone's doing well so how do you

1157
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,159
do that without um limiting

1158
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,480
diversity to me it's about creating the

1159
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:07,118
lanes of you know these kind of bulk

1160
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,639
Lanes of what cannabis can be um in

1161
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,920
terms of their

1162
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,920
chemistry um which is really hard and

1163
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,000
really complicated because that requires

1164
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,240
you know the consumer to learn about all

1165
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
these things just like we're to the

1166
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,558
point that we mentioned before about

1167
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,960
sativas you know um but that to me is

1168
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:24,519
the only way to really create a

1169
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,920
functioning supply chain I mean I hear

1170
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:29,400
that these words cultivar dependent so

1171
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,440
much as a disclaimer in our industry for

1172
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,480
like oh the reason we couldn't you know

1173
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,119
we can't tell you what the light recipe

1174
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,240
for these you know this with these LED

1175
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,760
lights because it's cultivar dependent

1176
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,159
or we can't tell you you know what the

1177
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,200
nutrient you know schedule should be or

1178
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,000
whether this is susceptible to powdery

1179
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:48,159
mildew in this region or not because

1180
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,280
it's cul of our dependent or we can't

1181
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:53,279
tell you you know so we can't really

1182
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,440
build this bigger functioning supply

1183
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,680
chain and the last thing we want to do

1184
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,880
is end up with limited diversity and

1185
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,558
like you know um Rob and I have written

1186
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,680
we write we have a column in cannabis

1187
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:08,599
business times called um um growing

1188
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:11,598
pains and it kind of highlights a lot of

1189
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:14,680
the challenges of like these

1190
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,838
Transitions and you know you see you saw

1191
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:21,199
in like in apples for instance apples

1192
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:24,599
are also a clonally produced um very

1193
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:26,399
heterozygous crop and the diversity in

1194
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,960
apples was just narrowed and narrowed

1195
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,720
and narrowed and narrowed to the point

1196
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,720
where we just had like Granny Smith and

1197
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,558
red delicious and you know a few other

1198
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,279
apples were just like that's like you

1199
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,960
have a green apple and you have a red

1200
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,720
apple and because they need to be these

1201
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,720
things they need to be they need to

1202
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,759
transport well they need to be shelf

1203
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,000
stable and you know resistant to pests

1204
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,079
and blah blah blah so they narrowed the

1205
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,199
genan pool to the point where you know

1206
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,720
people demanded a better Apple and now

1207
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:55,679
you know we see this big you know

1208
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:57,480
emerging Apple breeding industry where

1209
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,318
we've got all these amazing Fuji and

1210
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,719
honey crisps and all these really groovy

1211
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,558
apples of today but that was because a

1212
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:07,598
stepped in and said no we need to dumb

1213
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:09,680
things down and simplify it so that we

1214
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,318
can create the supply chain that

1215
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:14,960
functions so we need we do need to do

1216
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,880
that with cannabis because we do need to

1217
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,119
you know we do I mean especially for the

1218
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,599
farmer I think you know and the consumer

1219
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,039
really is the the two people that move

1220
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,760
Miss out the most the consumer is not

1221
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:28,199
getting the chemistry that they could

1222
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,079
because they're not getting access to

1223
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,798
the plants the diversity of what the

1224
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,280
chemical profile could could be because

1225
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:36,639
they're getting so much of you know

1226
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,599
Limon Cherry gelato or you know or so

1227
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:41,879
much a blue dream or whatever it is um

1228
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,280
but the grower the farmers really you

1229
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,960
know just can't build a robust model of

1230
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,440
production when they constantly are

1231
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,679
chasing their tail for like I don't know

1232
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,519
what I don't know what to grow next

1233
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:57,879
season that's going to sell you know and

1234
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:59,440
um so yeah it it's that that to me is

1235
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,760
and I I think that there's probably like

1236
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,159
a fixed to

1237
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:08,160
number in terms of like what that

1238
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:10,318
analysis paralysis number is for all

1239
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,879
crops where you can have a huge amount

1240
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,079
of diversity in rice or you can have a

1241
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,400
huge amount of diversity in some other

1242
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:22,039
crop but in each individual Market you

1243
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,240
can't um like I'll give an example and

1244
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,798
this might I don't know this might be

1245
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:27,000
even going down the hole too much but

1246
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:31,280
years ago

1247
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,639
a friend had this idea of doing a um a a

1248
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,519
cannabis bird book um that we would kind

1249
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:40,838
of copy the oton society's bird book for

1250
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:42,480
consumers so that they could learn about

1251
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:44,519
the different varieties of different

1252
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,079
cultivars and they could go to

1253
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,920
dispensaries and they would know what

1254
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:50,880
you know just like a a someone who buys

1255
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,798
a bird book could grabs orb oculars and

1256
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,358
goes to the park and they can spot a

1257
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:58,199
bird and after we started doing a little

1258
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,400
research just like 10 years ago or so

1259
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:00,838
started to do a little research and I

1260
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,838
started to compile some stuff and I

1261
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:05,519
started to go wait a second for one

1262
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:09,480
people don't even agree on what the name

1263
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:12,199
of the bird is and then every dispensary

1264
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,039
you go to just like every Park you go to

1265
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,639
there's a whole bunch of different birds

1266
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:18,358
and you don't see those birds at the

1267
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:19,598
other Park you know so you go to one

1268
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:21,078
dispensary and you learn these 10

1269
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,559
varieties that are amazing oh I love

1270
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:24,440
these then you go to another like how

1271
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,599
come you guys don't have any of those

1272
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,159
you know or they just renamed them to

1273
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:33,000
something else you know so the consumer

1274
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:37,039
is just completely out of the loop and

1275
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,760
is can't ever figure out what is a house

1276
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:42,759
finch or what's a red tail hawk or what

1277
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,280
anything is because

1278
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:48,079
we've over complicated things we've

1279
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,640
almost sold the dream of the feno hunt

1280
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:53,119
and the whole unicorn searching thing to

1281
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:56,798
the consumer as

1282
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:59,200
well um so that prevents the supply

1283
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:01,519
chain on their side ever from developing

1284
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,719
so they can't become the informed

1285
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,199
consumer where at least in wine which

1286
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:06,719
you're totally right I mean here in

1287
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:09,118
California I think the numbers are

1288
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,679
exactly the same where like maybe even

1289
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,400
two or three varieties produce the bulk

1290
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,239
of the whole state but the consumer

1291
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,119
learns the different appellations the

1292
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:21,000
consumer learns the different varieties

1293
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,920
the consumer learns a bit and they over

1294
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,519
time learn where their preferences are

1295
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,159
and that that's once again that's just

1296
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:31,599
for aroma that's just for mouth feel and

1297
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:34,639
sugar content and um it's not it's a lot

1298
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:38,720
easier for someone to be a wine snob

1299
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:40,879
than to be a a weed snob um but they do

1300
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,639
learn and it takes time it took a lot a

1301
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,160
long time for you know the the French

1302
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:50,000
and Italian wine industry to to create

1303
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:52,159
that culture and that knowledge base it

1304
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,719
took California a long time to do that

1305
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:56,920
so it's going to take a long time but

1306
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,519
the main thing is to build that consumer

1307
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,280
base that really has that ability to say

1308
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:05,559
like this is what I want you know they

1309
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,119
have to experience it so it means

1310
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:09,240
everyone's got to kind of step up and

1311
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,119
take some risks to actually present

1312
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:14,959
unique chemistry unique um plant you

1313
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,160
know Aroma profiles all that stuff and

1314
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,199
not just you

1315
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:23,480
know dumb down to the lowest common

1316
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:25,000
denominator which is you know I I hate

1317
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,920
to say it but you know we're in this

1318
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,559
weird candy gas world where you know

1319
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,519
dessert flavors sell really easy and

1320
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:36,519
maybe even just because they your mind

1321
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:38,798
thinks of dessert before you consume it

1322
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:42,000
or whatever you know it's just you're on

1323
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:44,400
a totally different path um so we need

1324
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,039
to figure out how to get brands that can

1325
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,440
kind of like cultivate and curate and

1326
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:52,799
experience for the consumer so the

1327
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:56,240
consumer becomes informed and the

1328
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:58,318
consumer drives the Breeders and cultiv

1329
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,558
cators to continue to provide the

1330
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:04,239
products that they demand um that that

1331
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:06,240
to me is like the only way to bring you

1332
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:09,479
super long-winded way to bring back

1333
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,598
sativas for one is because you know

1334
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,358
unlike Amsterdam in the 90s you know the

1335
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,039
Dutch the Dutch coffee shops they would

1336
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:18,440
pay you more for a sativa and they'd pay

1337
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:20,520
you more for organically grown because

1338
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,519
they knew you as a grower it cost you

1339
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:26,280
more to grow something that was longer

1340
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:27,759
flowering and lower yielding you know so

1341
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,599
but they knew they had to have it on the

1342
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,039
on the on the menu so they did it and

1343
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:35,880
that's why even today I bet you it's

1344
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:38,920
probably an artifact of that in

1345
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,480
Amsterdam there's more Haze varieties

1346
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,280
than there is in

1347
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,480
California I mean Haze is still all over

1348
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,319
Amsterdam you know last I checked it's

1349
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:51,519
still there and and like try to walk

1350
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:54,400
into dispensaries in LA and get piff and

1351
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:57,480
Super Silver Haze and original Haze and

1352
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,599
Neville's Haze and five hazes and like

1353
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,119
it's just not around cuz people don't

1354
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:05,760
grow it CU people won't pay what it

1355
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:09,358
takes to grow a you know 14 to 20 week

1356
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,680
plant that yields less than the eight or

1357
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,798
nine we

1358
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:15,838
plant totally totally so many really

1359
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:18,400
good points there I I want to quickly

1360
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:22,119
follow up with with with what you just

1361
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,519
said in mind what do you think is the

1362
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:28,280
future of hom growing what do you think

1363
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:30,000
it'll look like as time goes on because

1364
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,359
I mean at the moment the trajectory

1365
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,318
seems that more and more sort of small M

1366
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:38,000
and pop businesses getting pushed out of

1367
00:58:35,318 --> 00:58:39,920
the market and just as a general

1368
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,079
sentiment like I don't have figures at

1369
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,920
my disposal to quote but like it seems

1370
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,000
like less and less people are growing as

1371
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,159
time goes by to a certain extent um and

1372
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,798
bigger operations are popping up in

1373
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:54,639
their place what does the future of

1374
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:58,199
homegrown look like to you and as a

1375
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:01,679
followup do you think that homegrown

1376
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:04,480
will still lead the way in the sort of

1377
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:07,000
changing Market innovation of like

1378
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,719
strain popularity because I think that

1379
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,719
there's still a strong argument to be

1380
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:14,038
made that everything up until now has

1381
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:16,679
all relatively speaking come from the

1382
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:19,160
smaller grows like especially if you

1383
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:20,960
look at like mac and then onto run and

1384
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:24,719
of course all the OG and all that was

1385
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,599
all in garages but like I guess you know

1386
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,480
nowadays you could say well the popular

1387
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:31,119
thing at the moment is kind of like the

1388
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,400
rs11 and that sort of stuff and I think

1389
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,039
you could still make a small argument

1390
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,720
that that stuff even though those guys

1391
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,520
do have a little bit more room at their

1392
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:42,118
disposal it's it's still not glass house

1393
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:44,798
you know it's not like that sort of

1394
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:46,880
thing so from my point of view all the

1395
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:49,000
new strains that take the market by

1396
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,440
storm come from the small Growers and

1397
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,559
that's kind of what you were saying in

1398
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,358
the last answer and that they're

1399
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,519
expressing this is what we want like the

1400
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,639
effects and what not do you think that

1401
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:02,559
that will continue or do you think at

1402
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:04,358
some point big facilities will take over

1403
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,079
and start bringing cuz you know

1404
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:07,920
surprisingly we haven't seen a clone

1405
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,798
take over the market where it's like

1406
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,599
this was found at Glass House in a 1

1407
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:14,440
million seed finger hunt or whatever um

1408
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:15,920
I know a bit of a complex question but

1409
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,159
I'd love to hear your

1410
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,400
thoughts uh well I think plant plant

1411
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:24,199
people are weird like that and that I

1412
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,200
mean you know I grow a bunch of

1413
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:30,358
different you know I don't have a a you

1414
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:33,960
I just ran a house here in in um Ventura

1415
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:36,838
County and but I remember last year I

1416
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:40,240
sat down with my kids and we cro we had

1417
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:42,358
35 different edible plants grown in the

1418
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:44,679
backyard and some of them were really

1419
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:46,000
scraggly and just surviving and and I

1420
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:48,879
remember we had like six different types

1421
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,318
of tomatoes and there's more tomatoes in

1422
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,358
the backyard than there at the grocery

1423
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:56,639
store variety wise right and you know

1424
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:59,318
like a bigger more diverse variety of

1425
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:02,000
tomatoes and and like when I go I used

1426
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:04,759
to go to this little uh Nursery in West

1427
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,798
LA um that had all these amazing

1428
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,119
Tomatoes I'll use that as an example

1429
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:10,838
because tomatoes also were heavily you

1430
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,400
know um

1431
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:15,038
bottlenecked um and all these varieties

1432
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,160
I've never even heard of I've never

1433
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:19,000
heard their name they look interesting

1434
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:20,480
they got Stripes some of them are round

1435
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,760
some of them are pearshaped some of them

1436
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,358
are orange some of them are yellow some

1437
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,680
of them are purple some are black you

1438
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:28,038
know and you realize like there's a

1439
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,798
whole whole world of tomato breeders and

1440
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:34,240
tomato enthusiasts in this Horticultural

1441
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,719
side that it's always going to be there

1442
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:38,118
right and and then over the years you

1443
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:40,519
started to see those varieties slowly

1444
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,200
pop up in the market you saw heirloom

1445
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:44,119
tomatoes come back you know for years

1446
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:46,078
people used to think oh we can't afford

1447
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:47,798
to grow heirlooms because they they

1448
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,200
don't transport well and they don't you

1449
01:01:47,798 --> 01:01:53,239
know last that long and who's going to

1450
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:54,558
pay you know $4 a pound for a tomato

1451
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:56,159
when they can get them for a dollar or

1452
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,720
two and it's like well there's lot of

1453
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,679
people who will pay $4 a for tomatoes if

1454
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:03,480
they're really good and so I think

1455
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:07,358
there's this kind of like this plant

1456
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:10,199
hobbyist passion thing that keeps the

1457
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,960
genetic diversity going and luckily a

1458
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:15,038
lot of those guys still even they even

1459
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:17,119
work for commercial grows you know like

1460
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,599
you meet plenty of Growers who have

1461
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,240
insane amount of diversity in their home

1462
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,519
and all this weird stuff that they could

1463
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:26,358
never grow commercially because their

1464
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,920
boss wouldn't ever let them do that

1465
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:32,838
um but that's not going to stop them you

1466
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:35,000
know um and and I do think that that

1467
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:37,599
that that that that's encouraging and I

1468
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,480
I that's you know and I say this a lot

1469
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,278
you know and it's you know I don't know

1470
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,119
where but to me K the Cannabis is like a

1471
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:46,639
coyote and then it's super Elusive and

1472
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,880
it's like you can't really train it or

1473
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:51,239
capture it and it's really clever and

1474
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,358
right when you think you've you know

1475
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:55,358
figured out you know what it is or what

1476
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:58,719
it's going to be or whatever it just

1477
01:02:55,358 --> 01:03:01,038
pivots and it becomes something else um

1478
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:03,000
so I think that that's part of part of

1479
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,920
the nature and the chemical complexity

1480
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,318
is that we'll never be able to just rain

1481
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,240
it in and it'll always take these

1482
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:14,199
backyard enthusiasts and the

1483
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:18,519
Horticultural side to keep feeding the

1484
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:20,838
egg side you know hopefully um because

1485
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:23,719
cannabis I think you know like there's

1486
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:26,038
two tracks that we're on right now which

1487
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:27,639
is one is exploring the complexity

1488
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:30,119
around the the

1489
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:32,639
human um plant

1490
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,200
relationship you know re emerging out of

1491
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:35,838
prohibition and people are trying

1492
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:37,679
cannabis for the first time and all

1493
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:40,119
these new Delivery Systems and all this

1494
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,440
stuff so it's really complicated and

1495
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:44,680
it's like can be many different things

1496
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,599
it could be you know non psychoactive

1497
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:49,798
even um and then on the other side is

1498
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:52,559
just the very simple nature of cannabis

1499
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:55,278
as a plant that's grown by people like

1500
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:57,960
other plants that it's actually a pretty

1501
01:03:55,278 --> 01:04:00,798
fairly plant to grow grows in a lot of

1502
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:03,079
different climates it's very elastic to

1503
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:05,318
different ways of being cultivated and

1504
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:08,000
you know indoors Outdoors little plants

1505
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:11,759
big plants Vining plants bushing plants

1506
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,358
creeping plants you know so like it

1507
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,359
really wants to grow as you know like it

1508
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:20,199
really wants to thrive but but the other

1509
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:22,558
side of it the how and why we need to

1510
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:25,798
have the plant is way more

1511
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:29,240
complicated um and that's the thing that

1512
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:31,119
that I I fear that we might lose and

1513
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:34,000
that you know in this

1514
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,519
reemergence that all these isolated

1515
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,440
populations of people around the world

1516
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:44,079
that created these this diversity you

1517
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:46,679
know um pre-prohibition or up into and

1518
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:51,278
through prohibition all of that is about

1519
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:54,480
to experience the same dynamic as modern

1520
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:56,480
agriculture right and cannabis isn't

1521
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,679
even scalable like modern agriculture

1522
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,880
it'll never be grown like wheat or corn

1523
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:03,278
or

1524
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:05,480
rice um because we don't need that much

1525
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:08,039
of it for for drugs I mean if if we're

1526
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,519
growing it for food or fiber for grain

1527
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:12,599
and fiber then um then it makes sense

1528
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:14,079
that it can be treated like egg but we

1529
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:15,720
can't treat it like an Agricultural

1530
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,359
Product we can't treat it like grapes or

1531
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:20,078
Apples because we don't need to grow

1532
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:23,519
that much so we got to be careful how we

1533
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:26,160
put it in the Box it doesn't really fit

1534
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:28,159
in the way other products do

1535
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:31,318
you know so when you talk about Pharma

1536
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:35,000
and big egg getting into cannabis it'll

1537
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:37,278
never be those things you know um it's a

1538
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,559
limited amount of of of this crop that

1539
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:44,239
needs to be produced for people um drug

1540
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:46,599
type you know so uh we got to be really

1541
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:50,318
cautious about scaling it up and letting

1542
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:52,318
egg and letting big companies move in

1543
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:54,798
because in theory just a few people can

1544
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:57,400
grow I mean a few groups could grow the

1545
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:59,278
majority of the can AB for the world

1546
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,039
because it's not like corn and rice

1547
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:02,358
where you just need millions and

1548
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,480
millions and millions and millions and

1549
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:07,920
millions of acres to feed the bulk of

1550
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,559
the calories for all of humans cannabis

1551
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,200
consumption about how many people need

1552
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:13,000
you know how much each person needs to

1553
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:15,239
consume of this plant is relatively

1554
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,760
small compared to the other things so

1555
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:20,159
it's like we got to with because of the

1556
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,480
smallness of it we have to have a little

1557
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:26,118
bit more of a big picture about it and I

1558
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:28,400
don't know if that that you know

1559
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:31,440
speaks to what you asked but I mean to

1560
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:35,680
me that's the the the challenge around

1561
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,200
the diversity is that like um it's

1562
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:39,719
something that's incredibly diverse but

1563
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:42,239
you also don't need that much of it it's

1564
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:45,959
a sub it's a drug it's a substance you

1565
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:49,199
know it's not a staple like other big

1566
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,199
crops um so so you know God forbid

1567
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:54,000
someone should just mass-produce the red

1568
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:56,639
delicious version of cannabis then it

1569
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,920
just becomes one thing

1570
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:01,558
you know and that could easily happen I

1571
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,079
mean it could be mandated that way

1572
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,319
through regulations that you know

1573
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:09,039
cannabis has to be this because you know

1574
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,960
whatever body decided that it shouldn't

1575
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,960
be the other thing you know and we

1576
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,760
decided it potency can't be Beyond this

1577
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,519
amount it shouldn't have too much of

1578
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,160
that or it shouldn't have too much of

1579
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:20,798
this um and maybe that's maybe that

1580
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:22,239
complexity around creating those

1581
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:25,079
guidelines is part of the reason why it

1582
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:27,038
hasn't happened because it's not alcohol

1583
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:30,480
it's not as simple as just regulating it

1584
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:34,400
based off of one thing which is ethanol

1585
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,880
or one thing which is THC it became all

1586
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,000
these other things and kind of CBD was

1587
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,480
the gatekeeper for that just saying oh

1588
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,880
my God it can be something totally

1589
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:47,519
different and look how much that really

1590
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:50,640
helped push the discussion forward um by

1591
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:52,838
changing people's opinions on what it is

1592
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,598
you know so we want it to we want to

1593
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:56,038
have that diversity and that ability to

1594
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:57,680
Pivot and that ability to change

1595
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,920
opinions and to produce different

1596
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:02,960
products and to you know um so yeah it

1597
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,079
needs to stay diverse so it needs to

1598
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,880
stay in our backyards and we need more

1599
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:12,480
custodians and and Shepherds than

1600
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,400
ever yeah 100% I can I can totally agree

1601
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,600
with that and I guess as a as a quick

1602
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,838
follow on do you have any thoughts on

1603
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,480
what we might be able to do to help

1604
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:26,158
Safeguard some amount of the genetic

1605
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:29,079
diversity outside of just consumer

1606
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:31,318
demand because like in an Ideal World

1607
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:34,359
consumers would demand that diversity

1608
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:36,400
and then easy fix you know um the

1609
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:38,480
companies are going to do it but I guess

1610
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,920
I'm interested in trying to think like I

1611
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,039
don't even know if it's possible but is

1612
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,279
there some way to try to help ensure it

1613
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:47,560
stays around you know even in the

1614
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:50,319
absence of that I'm not entirely sure

1615
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:53,798
and as a as a quick follow on do you

1616
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:56,560
fear that you know some of the big a

1617
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:59,119
companies are really sort of of licking

1618
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,839
their chops at the ideas of real

1619
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:02,399
commercialized cannabis I I remember

1620
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,920
when I was writing the questions for

1621
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,960
this I I jokingly thought to myself like

1622
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,119
you know do you think there's a

1623
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,920
whiteboard somewhere in Monsanto where

1624
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:14,000
they've already got a Terminator Gene in

1625
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,960
mind for some uh you know maloi or

1626
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,079
something like you know what I mean uh

1627
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,039
what what are your thoughts on

1628
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:20,920
preserving the genetics and and do you

1629
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,198
think that uh we're going to go down a

1630
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,399
dark

1631
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:26,798
path I mean well well definitely I mean

1632
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:28,759
I don't know I mean it's not I don't

1633
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:30,960
think we're going on a a darker path

1634
01:09:28,759 --> 01:09:33,198
with cannabis than anything else in life

1635
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,920
I mean it's just the nature of you know

1636
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:40,519
the modern system right the modern

1637
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:43,199
manuscript um so consumerism and you

1638
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,560
know the way we engage with products you

1639
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,519
know people don't always make the best

1640
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,039
decisions with the food that they eat or

1641
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,080
the cars they buy or whatever so we

1642
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:53,039
can't expect them all to becomed

1643
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:55,920
informed cannabis consumers and keep the

1644
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,279
diversity alive based off of their their

1645
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,760
consumption needs you know so it is

1646
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:04,519
definitely up to us um you know to have

1647
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,760
a little bit more play a bit more of a

1648
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,400
role in that and I think that's why that

1649
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,640
you know honestly the hom grower is

1650
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:13,559
really important that way because the

1651
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:16,159
pressures on um the agronomic side don't

1652
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,560
exist so if someone's got some plants in

1653
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:20,759
the backyard they don't really care if

1654
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,440
they come in and the first week of

1655
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,640
October or the last week of October as

1656
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:27,198
long as they don't mold out or or all

1657
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,840
the way into de December even you know

1658
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:30,719
or you know whether they're in their

1659
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,800
tent if it grows for nine weeks or 10

1660
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,679
weeks doesn't really have a big impact

1661
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,600
where like the CFO for your big company

1662
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:38,158
is like might say nothing over nine

1663
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,600
weeks you know it can never happen not

1664
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:43,119
in this facility it's like you know um

1665
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,920
so that is I think that's really

1666
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:48,158
important and to to maintain that and

1667
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,679
you know and that is happening I that

1668
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:55,479
I'm not afraid of that at all um but

1669
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:59,800
what what I do worry about is

1670
01:10:55,479 --> 01:11:01,799
the overc commodification of like the um

1671
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:04,320
the inter like if cannabis overnight

1672
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,520
became an international like let me back

1673
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,759
back it up a little bit like think about

1674
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,280
what would have happened to cannabis if

1675
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:13,320
prohibition never

1676
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:15,759
happened right if it just fell fell the

1677
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:18,639
regular track because think about how

1678
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,360
cannabis was is an ancient crop but

1679
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,640
industrial agriculture was just getting

1680
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:25,359
rolling as prohibition happened you know

1681
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,440
and Industrial agriculture would have

1682
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:31,759
happened to cannabis for the past 80

1683
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:33,599
some years right so I think we would

1684
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,320
have lost a lot of that diversity so

1685
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,880
it's it's it's it's kind of like the

1686
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:40,840
blowback of these guys who tried to you

1687
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,639
know put cannabis in jail they ended up

1688
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,840
opening it up in a way that they could

1689
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:48,159
never imagine um in the marketplace now

1690
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,039
the diversity in these land rais

1691
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:51,920
populations and the diversity around the

1692
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,760
world might have had a big impact from

1693
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,880
prohibition but the marketplace

1694
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,560
diversity I think was

1695
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:00,800
was a big gift because it would have

1696
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,360
been definitely you know it's just if

1697
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,719
you think of you know when you when you

1698
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:07,198
look at a a a a large field of cannabis

1699
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:09,119
and you see some varieties that do well

1700
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,719
and some don't to Big Egg they're just

1701
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:13,559
like okay we only grow the ones that do

1702
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:15,279
well regardless of you know what anyone

1703
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,199
thinks you know we're going we're going

1704
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:18,759
to move in One Direction you know and

1705
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,599
that's how you end up with that kind of

1706
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,159
bottleneck but

1707
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:25,760
um

1708
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:28,599
um in terms of moving forward

1709
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,320
I mean I don't know it's it's really

1710
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:34,320
hard to

1711
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:36,399
see how big EG and the Monsanto of the

1712
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:39,639
world could

1713
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:41,719
really capture cannabis from could

1714
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:44,359
capture the diversity and limit it you

1715
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:48,399
know it's really hard it's like the cats

1716
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:51,639
out of the bag um and I know like what's

1717
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:53,479
an example I know like in the um Rob

1718
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:56,880
told me this story years ago about the

1719
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:58,319
the um the wine industry in the USSR

1720
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,520
being

1721
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:04,359
completely um bottlenecked because they

1722
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,760
had decided they wanted to grow this

1723
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:10,079
only you know one or two varieties for

1724
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,840
Mass um you know for the the whole for

1725
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,399
the whole USSR we don't we don't need

1726
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:17,319
the diversity we want to streamline it

1727
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:18,839
for distribution and yada yada um and

1728
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:20,840
but it was the guys it was the gardeners

1729
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:23,319
who kept you know vines in their

1730
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,560
backyard that kept all that diversity

1731
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:29,158
and were able to reinvigorate

1732
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:32,719
the the wine industry after the USSR

1733
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:36,079
fell um so I'm not really worried about

1734
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:40,920
the diversity I'm worried more about

1735
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:43,920
like the social experiment of cannabis

1736
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:46,399
you know of like what and and you know

1737
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,800
you see like gummies and vape pins have

1738
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:52,119
definitely taken over um in a big way

1739
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,279
because they're socially more

1740
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:57,679
approachable and they fit into people's

1741
01:13:54,279 --> 01:14:01,960
lifestyles easier but I sometimes wonder

1742
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:04,760
you know if if we're going to fit in

1743
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,359
cannabis the right way back to that you

1744
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,440
know why are we growing why is there so

1745
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:10,079
much Afghan influence in modern cannabis

1746
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:15,359
and not that there's a right or a wrong

1747
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:17,840
way but is it um is it going to be

1748
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:19,319
beneficial for Humanity in some kind of

1749
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,440
way I don't know I mean that's a kind of

1750
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:28,439
a lofty a lofty you know thought but

1751
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:29,599
um I personally feel like there's um

1752
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:33,279
that there definitely that there has

1753
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,360
been something lost in modern weed you

1754
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:37,840
know that there's just a little bit and

1755
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,799
maybe it's maybe it's because Aroma and

1756
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,639
you know loud cannabis has like become

1757
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:46,719
so much more popular but um just some

1758
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:48,840
subtle nuances that I think would be you

1759
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:52,079
know

1760
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:53,800
helpful no it's it's funny I hope no one

1761
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:56,519
takes offense when I say this when you

1762
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:59,000
said that it reminds me of like you know

1763
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,239
when nii is proclaiming the death of God

1764
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,039
you know it's like something's changed

1765
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:04,839
it's hard to articulate but there's a

1766
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,760
little something that's changed and it's

1767
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,679
kind of

1768
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,719
undeniable um look I I agree with all of

1769
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:12,719
that and that is that is cool to hear

1770
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,480
that story about the USSR and how you

1771
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,158
know like there will be people much like

1772
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:19,718
our listeners and ourselves who will

1773
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:22,960
likely be be safeguards for some of

1774
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:25,079
these genetics longterm but I want to uh

1775
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,359
give people who might not have the

1776
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:29,399
pleasure of knowing your backstory a bit

1777
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,920
more information which will help ground

1778
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:33,920
some of these answers a bit more so

1779
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,600
after where I think what 1 hour deep

1780
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,840
let's ask our our usual first question

1781
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:43,239
tell me about your first experience with

1782
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,560
cannabis um yeah I mean I I can't

1783
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:48,279
remember my first experience because I

1784
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:51,520
mean we my parents both found cannabis

1785
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:55,119
early in their lives um my dad was from

1786
01:15:51,520 --> 01:16:00,000
Alabama and my mom was from Florida and

1787
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:03,639
and they both found cannabis um as young

1788
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:07,960
adults and decided to move to California

1789
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:12,760
in the early 60s on separate paths and

1790
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:15,840
met actually my mom and dad met um in

1791
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:17,800
the middle of the night over a joint you

1792
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:22,440
know because that was the world that

1793
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:25,119
they lived in and um so it's always been

1794
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:27,238
there it's always been a part of my life

1795
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:29,920
it's always been somewhat

1796
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:34,599
normalized I'd say some of my earliest

1797
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:37,239
memories in life are watching you know a

1798
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:39,920
a pipe or a joint go around the circle

1799
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:41,718
I'm the youngest of six I have um you

1800
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,279
know my oldest brother is 10 years older

1801
01:16:41,719 --> 01:16:49,359
than me so um consumption was just

1802
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:52,800
normal all around me and and cultivation

1803
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:55,039
to some extent as well so it was always

1804
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,400
there you know and the smell was always

1805
01:16:55,039 --> 01:17:00,679
there and the people were always there

1806
01:16:57,399 --> 01:17:02,638
and the plant was always there um it's

1807
01:17:00,679 --> 01:17:06,239
it's just been kind of the background of

1808
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:09,000
my life in a way and it was kind of the

1809
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:12,000
the connective tissue with the community

1810
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:16,039
that I grew up in was Cannabis and they

1811
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,479
were back to the land beat ni um people

1812
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:22,639
I was born in Big Sir California

1813
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:24,519
1969 um and by that point you know there

1814
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:26,279
already a little bit of a community

1815
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,120
there one of the first places where you

1816
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:29,679
could argue there was kind of a new

1817
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:34,279
world

1818
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:36,359
um uh cannabis culture and and Industry

1819
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:37,840
a little bit people were cultivating and

1820
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:41,158
selling and

1821
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:44,400
celebrating um bigir had the the harvest

1822
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:49,879
parties which started in'

1823
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:52,000
67 or so um through family friends that

1824
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,639
lived um my parents were living on a

1825
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,198
place I think it was plaset Creek in big

1826
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:59,639
Su and and they invited a friend to come

1827
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:03,079
and stay with us and him and his family

1828
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:05,119
in 66 or so and that was Patrick Cassidy

1829
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:08,238
and we moved from plaset and then

1830
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:10,960
Patrick um came up and started growing

1831
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:15,039
um cannabis there and then by I think

1832
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,960
67 started having these Harvest parties

1833
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,560
where people you know could kind of

1834
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:22,279
freely come and celebrate and they would

1835
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:25,159
um you know it would be a sea of VW

1836
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:27,960
buses and and you know hippies back to

1837
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:29,719
the Landers and beatnicks and musicians

1838
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,560
and all kinds of far up people who would

1839
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:36,119
come to Big Sir and kind of feel

1840
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:39,280
open um so that was that was where it

1841
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:42,158
all started for me and then as a young

1842
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:44,679
adult or sorry as a young child we moved

1843
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:48,879
to New York City and then to Los

1844
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:53,399
Angeles um but my older brother stayed

1845
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:57,760
in big Su or moved back to Big by 77 or

1846
01:18:53,399 --> 01:19:01,638
something like that and um cultivated in

1847
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:05,719
um in Big Sir for years so that was my

1848
01:19:01,639 --> 01:19:07,840
um my strong relationship with the plant

1849
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:12,000
and the community and all that was

1850
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:14,719
definitely founded in biger even though

1851
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,079
I still live most of my life in SoCal

1852
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:18,480
but my f part of my family was there and

1853
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:21,559
that's where most of the herb we

1854
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:25,479
consumed was grown and that's where

1855
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:27,960
that's where it all started for me

1856
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:30,919
wow what a what an incredible

1857
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:32,679
introduction I mean it sounds like it's

1858
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,800
been there the whole time which is

1859
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:39,000
really cool your experience with it goes

1860
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:41,840
so deep i' I'd love to hear first off do

1861
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,359
you ever have any recollection of your

1862
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:47,239
parents ever telling you of what they

1863
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:49,519
considered to be really memorable herb

1864
01:19:47,238 --> 01:19:51,279
or you know what what do you think it

1865
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,000
was like for them what were they

1866
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:56,759
consuming was it import was it the early

1867
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,960
stuff produc in California did they ever

1868
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,960
tell you much about their

1869
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:05,158
experience yes um well I had a very

1870
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:07,279
close relationship with both my parents

1871
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:13,000
and and we you know talked about

1872
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:16,158
cannabis a lot um my dad was um you know

1873
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,039
also imported a bit in the late 60s and

1874
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:22,399
early

1875
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:24,399
70s and um and grew and but actually

1876
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:25,198
here's a funny story is I actually asked

1877
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:28,799
my

1878
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:30,638
mom um about the first time she consumed

1879
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:35,960
cannabis which would have been in

1880
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:40,000
Gainesville Florida in 1959 or 1960 or

1881
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:42,480
something and I asked her like specifics

1882
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,198
about like the joint and how big it was

1883
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:47,000
and how many people smoked it and what

1884
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,439
happened when they smoked it and I tell

1885
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,359
you back to the potency thing her

1886
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:55,519
description sure was of some people who

1887
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:57,479
got really really high you know like

1888
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,560
I mean they got they went through the

1889
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:02,839
full you know the full just giggles and

1890
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,520
wacky and then philosophical then

1891
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,760
paranoid and all of that stuff off of a

1892
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,199
little I mean between four people

1893
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,079
couldn't had to be a quarter gram of

1894
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:15,238
import you know flower from that they

1895
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:17,319
got from you know their beat Nick friend

1896
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:19,879
who knew guys at the Jazz Club or

1897
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:21,399
something and um but I always thought

1898
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:24,960
that was interesting because it wasn't

1899
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:27,319
like like the story of like smoking um

1900
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,960
you know 70s homegrown that was leafy

1901
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:32,039
and barely got you high or something it

1902
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:36,239
was like no whatever they smoked worked

1903
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:38,039
um but you know but yeah the the the the

1904
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,079
Big Sur was all about you know for the

1905
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:44,439
most part it was all mostly Mexican

1906
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:46,639
varieties grown there um into the 70s

1907
01:21:44,439 --> 01:21:48,599
and then you know with some Colombian

1908
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:53,600
and Panamanian and then a little bit of

1909
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:56,120
Thai and then by the mid 70s um the

1910
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,280
African influence came came in from Malo

1911
01:21:56,119 --> 01:22:00,639
the corn cops in

1912
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:02,119
7677 but um yeah that was it and they

1913
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:05,279
were all I mean that was that was kind

1914
01:22:02,119 --> 01:22:06,960
of the that was part of why I had this

1915
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:09,439
this big imprint on these narrowly

1916
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,359
fridas is because all my early

1917
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:16,559
introduction with Canabis was all the

1918
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:19,519
not the same profile but some common

1919
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:24,080
common ground let's just say you know in

1920
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:26,600
terms of effect um so yeah um but yeah

1921
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:29,359
we we um we saw a lot and and saw a lot

1922
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:31,679
of cannabis import throughout my youth

1923
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:33,319
too you know cannabis every you know if

1924
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:36,399
people bought and

1925
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:39,119
sold um from all around the world and

1926
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:42,198
and people were often bringing in you

1927
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:45,599
know things from from everywhere um you

1928
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:47,960
know coffee tins from Hawaii

1929
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,920
and not a lot I didn't see honestly I

1930
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:53,480
never saw a lot of like brick weed and

1931
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:55,760
stuff like that um until like my teenage

1932
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:58,919
years when my other friends would

1933
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:02,960
present flower that they found and stuff

1934
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:05,560
but um saw a lot of uh interesting

1935
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:08,119
different profiles you know just one I

1936
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:10,639
guess one thing that would um was a big

1937
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:13,359
imprint on me as the kid is how visually

1938
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:16,840
different Cannabis used to be from

1939
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:19,920
region to region and from you know from

1940
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:23,199
variety to variety just visually

1941
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:25,480
stimulating big big Spears and balls and

1942
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:28,519
bright red hairs and orange hairs and

1943
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:33,678
lime green and dark green and golden and

1944
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:36,560
brown and purple and all that

1945
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:39,880
stuff yeah wow I mean I can only imagine

1946
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:42,039
especially when it was so sort of raw

1947
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,920
and coming from the the land race spot

1948
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:46,920
in many instances that would have been

1949
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:50,560
really really cool I guess certainly one

1950
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:53,119
of the uh frequently Asked fan submitted

1951
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:56,159
questions from our patreon listeners was

1952
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:57,760
many of them sort of asked mult like

1953
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,679
many questions but they all sort of fell

1954
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,280
into one of two um you know broader

1955
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:05,960
questions the first one being what was

1956
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:08,198
it like to grow in the Big Sir area

1957
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,960
itself because many people commented

1958
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:13,638
quite a foggy area right like it's high

1959
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,158
humidity I'm assuming or just issues

1960
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:18,359
with moisture what what was that like

1961
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:20,079
and did that lend itself I guess a bit

1962
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:22,359
to the fact that you guys were growing a

1963
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:24,880
lot of sativas was that part of it and

1964
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:27,039
then as a followup to that can you tell

1965
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,719
us a bit about you know the faved Big

1966
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:32,560
Sir hly weed ye yeah um well yeah

1967
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:36,039
definitely people were growing all

1968
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:38,360
sativas so that that susceptibility to

1969
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:40,399
mold and mildew wasn't really nearly as

1970
01:24:38,359 --> 01:24:43,238
much of an issue but people were also

1971
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:45,679
growing up out of the fog line you know

1972
01:24:43,238 --> 01:24:48,279
up on The Ridges where you could you

1973
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:51,920
know get out into the sun made a big

1974
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:54,759
difference um a big difference obviously

1975
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:58,399
you know for certain varieties but um

1976
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:00,920
yeah Big Sir holy weed is um it's the

1977
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:05,198
story of stories you know it's it's uh

1978
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:08,440
one of the few like um you know it's the

1979
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:12,359
it's the aaal goals of the US you know

1980
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:14,839
so it's it's filled with L and I am you

1981
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:17,039
know totally responsible for part of the

1982
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:21,800
misinformation that's been spread around

1983
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:25,319
over the years um but uh I can give you

1984
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,639
the the story The the the story as I

1985
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:28,799
know it and then all the different

1986
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:32,880
versions that are told which are all

1987
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:36,159
much more interesting um but um

1988
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:38,319
essentially Patrick Cassidy who was the

1989
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:39,679
one who did the the harvest parties and

1990
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:43,359
was really one of the first you know

1991
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:46,719
commercial growers in California he was

1992
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:49,479
growing flower and a friend another

1993
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:52,719
family friend um said hey man your weed

1994
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:55,799
is like holy weed you know and that was

1995
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:59,198
it and so then that became Big Sir holy

1996
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:02,679
weed and it was predominantly

1997
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:05,519
Mexican um but the thing is is you got

1998
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:08,399
to remember people didn't clone people

1999
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,719
didn't really breed we can get into like

2000
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,799
in a minute if you want to talk about

2001
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:13,480
how CIA kind of came about because that

2002
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,159
that book was written by family friends

2003
01:26:13,479 --> 01:26:17,759
as

2004
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:20,839
well um but so there the idea that big

2005
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,800
sir holy weed was a line or this

2006
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:26,079
lineage it really was a class it was

2007
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:29,000
really good weed grown and originally it

2008
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:33,439
was weed grown by Patrick you know but

2009
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,960
it could have been of various descent um

2010
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:38,319
but then it quickly became such a

2011
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,520
brandable thing that a lot of Growers

2012
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:42,960
who grew in Big Sur were calling their

2013
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:45,199
flower Big Sir holy weed and that

2014
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,920
stretched all the way into the 80s and

2015
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,638
all the way past Way Beyond when all the

2016
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,880
different hybridization happened people

2017
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:55,400
were still selling it as big star holy

2018
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:57,679
weed um so

2019
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:59,359
that's the truth behind it it's kind of

2020
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,920
like an Appalachian it's kind of like

2021
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:03,920
just Big Sir bud it's a good bud from

2022
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,840
Big Sir you know which is also what I've

2023
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,679
heard you know the Alaska Thunder [ __ ]

2024
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,360
story from some guys I met in up Alaska

2025
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:12,279
they said that's the same thing Alaskan

2026
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:14,599
it's good it's good herb from the valley

2027
01:27:12,279 --> 01:27:17,359
it's the manusa valley and this is the

2028
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:19,480
you know whatever you know I don't know

2029
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:23,158
um but so that is that is the truth and

2030
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:27,479
what kind of the the story for me was

2031
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:30,879
that when I when I bred sage in

2032
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:33,439
Amsterdam and I brought um I found this

2033
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:36,679
unknown hay

2034
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:37,678
Afghan female and I didn't know you know

2035
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:41,319
what it

2036
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:42,880
was um and I C made the C and then I

2037
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:46,319
decided I wanted to make some seeds so I

2038
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:48,600
brought Big Sir seed and that big sir

2039
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:52,679
seed was of African lineage it was

2040
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:55,000
chamba um and I made the cross and so it

2041
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:57,480
was this unknown female times this

2042
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,319
chamba Afghan cross and then I did a

2043
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:02,039
back cross and made a few made some

2044
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:04,759
parents and stuff and so when some of

2045
01:28:02,039 --> 01:28:07,000
the first batches of seeds were sold as

2046
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:11,679
I think it was labeled as Sage times Big

2047
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:14,920
Sir holy weed so the story kind of that

2048
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:16,440
that there was Big Sir holy weed in Sage

2049
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,158
which is true because there's Big Sir

2050
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:22,638
Afghan I mean Big Sir African weed in

2051
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:24,519
sage and there's Haze in there and it's

2052
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,319
all part of the Big Sur story it's all

2053
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:29,080
part of the Central Coast story it's all

2054
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:32,279
part of the killer weed grown on the

2055
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:34,719
hill story but there is no lineage and

2056
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:37,920
that's the main thing you know and then

2057
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:40,439
to comp to complicate things further you

2058
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:44,319
know friends family and friends were

2059
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:45,479
growing under to get out of the fog they

2060
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,840
were growing right underneath the

2061
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:50,718
Franciscan

2062
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:54,239
Monastery um and it's a Hermitage you

2063
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:56,480
know and so that was another level to

2064
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,039
holy weed and I perpetuated that story

2065
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:00,079
by saying like Yeah The Holy weed is

2066
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:02,719
Holy weed it was grown by The Hermitage

2067
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:05,319
and blah blah blah so then over time you

2068
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:07,920
start hearing this story about a monk

2069
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:09,479
and this monk was a bunk named Perry and

2070
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,840
he was at the Buddhist from the Buddhist

2071
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,599
well the Buddhist Monastery thing in Big

2072
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,039
Sir happened years later and it's at a

2073
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,760
totally different

2074
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:21,719
location totally has nothing to do with

2075
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:24,639
it and you know and in the Perry thing

2076
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:26,719
and the zakus purple it's like yeah it

2077
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:29,319
was Mexican cannabis cuz the majority of

2078
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:32,319
the Cannabis was Mexican in Big

2079
01:29:29,319 --> 01:29:34,319
Sir but the actual story of a guy who

2080
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:37,039
sourced it and found it and preserved it

2081
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:38,559
and gave it that's all just lore that's

2082
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,639
all just made up and then there's

2083
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,880
there's even African things that it came

2084
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:45,880
from Olatunji the drummer and all this

2085
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:48,800
stuff you know there's truth to it

2086
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:51,960
Olatunji was a family friend and he

2087
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:54,719
would play in Big Sir but he didn't

2088
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,880
bring flow you know it was more of us

2089
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,359
sharing these African varieties with

2090
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:02,359
them saying look at this great Malawi

2091
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:03,839
and Tanzanian stuff we're growing here

2092
01:30:02,359 --> 01:30:05,920
um so there's all these different

2093
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,880
stories about the monk named Perry and

2094
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:11,399
was he a Franciscan or was he Buddhist

2095
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,880
and the African influence from Olatunji

2096
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:15,719
all these things and and just the

2097
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:18,679
reality is it was just a guy saying to

2098
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:21,279
another guy you grow really good weed

2099
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:24,440
you know and it's kind of like I think

2100
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:27,599
that that's the same for Maui woi Alaska

2101
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:29,960
[ __ ] and maybe a bunch of other

2102
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,719
you know aaal gold and whatever it's

2103
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,520
like is it was it a breeding project

2104
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,760
where someone created a lineage and does

2105
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:39,560
that lineage last

2106
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,480
today is a big difference from someone

2107
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:45,080
saying this was great amazing flower

2108
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:48,158
that you grew this time you know and so

2109
01:30:45,079 --> 01:30:52,760
it became just a thing and it still is

2110
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:54,519
today you know and and I still you know

2111
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,840
I have a a cult of our

2112
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:59,440
that I selected out of my sage and I

2113
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:01,960
call it Big Sir and I call sometimes I

2114
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:05,519
even call it holy weed because it

2115
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:08,039
embodies that it has that that that

2116
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:11,800
signature that I remember as a kid of

2117
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:14,238
that type of cannabis it has those genes

2118
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:16,480
in there from that Haze influence and

2119
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:20,399
from that chamba

2120
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:23,359
influence um and it's amazing iy

2121
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:27,039
uplifting cannabis so I'm happy to use

2122
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:29,359
to throw the Big Sir on there but you

2123
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:32,158
know there is no one thing called Big

2124
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:34,960
Sir holy weed you know and the people

2125
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:37,439
who went on to breed with different

2126
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,239
things they legitimately got seeds that

2127
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:43,000
were called holy weed and they did come

2128
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:45,238
from weed that was sold as holy weed and

2129
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,880
some of the guys who have lines today

2130
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:51,198
it's great weed and it is Mexican

2131
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:53,560
descent cannabis from Big Sir so it it

2132
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:59,118
also deserves the credit of being called

2133
01:31:53,560 --> 01:32:02,360
holy weed um today but the actual story

2134
01:31:59,118 --> 01:32:04,799
of a guy and how it happened it's that's

2135
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:07,118
just a it's you know as far as I know

2136
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:09,880
that there's no no validity to it and I

2137
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:13,039
can't find one single person that can

2138
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:15,480
corroborate any of the you know the

2139
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:17,399
folklore on online whereas the other

2140
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:19,959
stuff I just grew like these were Big

2141
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:22,719
Sir holy weed was a name from like back

2142
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:25,118
to you know my earliest memories of

2143
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:28,239
cannabis it's like that came along with

2144
01:32:25,118 --> 01:32:29,719
it so it was never like something that I

2145
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:33,000
discovered or learned about it was just

2146
01:32:29,719 --> 01:32:35,480
part of your life you know and it was

2147
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,359
never you know anything other than it

2148
01:32:35,479 --> 01:32:42,479
just being great cannabis from Big Sir

2149
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:45,519
you know um but of a certain lineage yes

2150
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:48,959
of a certain class yes of a

2151
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:51,199
certain type yes and I think that's an

2152
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,279
important thing back to the land race

2153
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:57,238
thing and what we wanted cannabis to be

2154
01:32:54,279 --> 01:33:00,599
it is a very specific thing you can't

2155
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:02,118
come up with an OG from from sorry not

2156
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,400
picking an OG it's like one of those

2157
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:06,079
things just a it's a great go-to but you

2158
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:08,279
can't pick an OG and grow it in big Ser

2159
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:09,920
call it holy weed you know just because

2160
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:12,960
it was grown in that region because it's

2161
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:16,480
not just cannabis from Big Sir and you

2162
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:20,679
know but it it is a certain you know

2163
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:23,039
chemical class you could say um but yeah

2164
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:24,920
there's there's the the the online

2165
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:28,158
stories are way cooler than just you

2166
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:31,158
know the reality is usually much

2167
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:33,039
simpler yeah isn't that often the case

2168
01:33:31,158 --> 01:33:37,000
well look that's that's so interesting

2169
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:39,399
to hear that I guess I'd love to ask

2170
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,118
given that you do see people referencing

2171
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:44,638
it sometimes in breeding work and given

2172
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:47,399
that it is something that's not very

2173
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:49,960
well represented in people's minds just

2174
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:52,439
for anyone wondering including myself

2175
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,520
How would how would you describe I know

2176
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:56,638
that it's a broad thing the holy weed

2177
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,520
but the one that you sort of Envision in

2178
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,480
your mind how would you describe it is

2179
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:02,520
it is it like a plant that looks like a

2180
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:05,399
haze plant and smells like a haze plant

2181
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:06,840
to you is it do you think the Mexicans

2182
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:08,399
were similar to the ones that were used

2183
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:11,239
in Haze or they were a bit different and

2184
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:13,118
it wasn't quite as racy how would you

2185
01:34:11,238 --> 01:34:14,678
sort of just describe smoking it the

2186
01:34:13,118 --> 01:34:18,439
smell and the effects for anyone who

2187
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:20,319
hasn't tried it I mean I I to be honest

2188
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:22,799
like then I'd have to really think that

2189
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:26,198
if there if there was ever a holy weed

2190
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:27,760
so like it's a spectrum right it's a

2191
01:34:26,198 --> 01:34:30,118
spectrum of the like I can tell you the

2192
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:33,760
first time I grew what someone else was

2193
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:35,439
was someone gave me in 94 seeds of biger

2194
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:38,840
holy weed a friend from Santa Cruz and I

2195
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:41,439
grew it out and it looked exactly like

2196
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:45,199
what I remember cannabis from the 70s

2197
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:48,678
being it was big giant green Mexican

2198
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:51,279
redhair sativa plants and it was just

2199
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:52,560
mediocre High though you know maybe I

2200
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:54,399
didn't maybe I didn't select the right

2201
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:57,320
seed you know I only G it out of a few

2202
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:59,519
seedss but it was classic Mexican

2203
01:34:57,319 --> 01:35:01,118
California weed just big giant you know

2204
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,400
Christmas tree

2205
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:06,599
structure um and and to me I mean that's

2206
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:10,479
why like when I say like Haze embodies

2207
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:12,039
that in modern cannabis and a lot of and

2208
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:14,919
that's and like to all the the breeding

2209
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:17,679
work that's been done I I fully believe

2210
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,399
that the seed producers today who have

2211
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,960
big sir holy weed in their lineage got

2212
01:35:19,399 --> 01:35:24,039
it from people who got seeds out of

2213
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:26,880
flour from those original things that

2214
01:35:24,039 --> 01:35:29,560
were called holy weed but remember it's

2215
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,600
the original things it's back to that

2216
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:35,080
you've got 100 plants in one bag and

2217
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,400
next year there are 100 different plants

2218
01:35:35,079 --> 01:35:37,880
and next year there are 100 different

2219
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:39,879
plants and next year there are 100

2220
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:43,480
different plants so if you bought Big

2221
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:46,279
Sir holy weed from 73 to 78 or

2222
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:48,479
something it was never one thing even if

2223
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:50,399
you bought it from just from that one

2224
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,359
producer you know what I mean cuz for

2225
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:54,638
one nobody breeding breeding you know

2226
01:35:52,359 --> 01:35:57,319
for one segregating Mal is really

2227
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:59,239
difficult right so so like people who

2228
01:35:57,319 --> 01:36:00,679
were and when I was a kid nobody called

2229
01:35:59,238 --> 01:36:02,799
themselves breeders they just produced

2230
01:36:00,679 --> 01:36:04,560
seed for next year so everyone was

2231
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,920
constantly producing seed for next year

2232
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,039
and there wasn't you know I'm just

2233
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:11,319
saying it wasn't what people assume it

2234
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:13,399
is today you didn't have Grow rooms you

2235
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:15,359
didn't have Chambers you didn't have

2236
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:18,679
isolation you didn't have any of those

2237
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:20,359
things to create lineages and it wasn't

2238
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:22,359
you know David Watson wasn't producing

2239
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:24,198
holy weed so there wasn't like a

2240
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:28,359
concerted breeding effort over five

2241
01:36:24,198 --> 01:36:30,399
years to develop something so that's why

2242
01:36:28,359 --> 01:36:33,799
when I came to

2243
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:35,638
Amsterdam and I had been smoking hazes

2244
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:38,039
and Northern Light crosses and all these

2245
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:42,000
stuff and skunk ones and then when I did

2246
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:43,840
did the seed batch in my backyard um in

2247
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,399
my Courtyard and I had the one little

2248
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:50,360
plant in the corner that was literally 4

2249
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:53,198
Ines tall maybe and it had less than a

2250
01:36:50,359 --> 01:36:56,158
gram of flour on it but I went down and

2251
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:59,118
give it little sniff and it was just

2252
01:36:56,158 --> 01:37:02,479
like instant like time portal to my

2253
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:05,759
childhood of that that Aroma that

2254
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:08,319
profile that biger flavor and it wasn't

2255
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,400
to me it wasn't being I didn't want I

2256
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:12,158
didn't call it biger holy weed even in

2257
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:15,238
my mind at that point it was just the

2258
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:18,759
smell of my childhood of cannabis from

2259
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:20,799
my childhood so it was like a a instant

2260
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:22,920
marker so that's where I knew I was like

2261
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:25,480
whatever is in this plant that's what I

2262
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:28,719
remember and that's what I want it to be

2263
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:31,759
for me so then it was just a matter of

2264
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,158
you know finding some other plants to

2265
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,639
cross it with in order to ra seeds but

2266
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:39,319
that original female that unknown female

2267
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:42,319
had it in there and I assume it was Haze

2268
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:44,880
that was contributing to that because it

2269
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:47,679
was unknown so that's why I say like you

2270
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:50,840
know hay embodies that and so does so

2271
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:52,440
does maloi and so does a lot of other

2272
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,560
things that are out there that I still

2273
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:58,359
encounter you know I love the African

2274
01:37:54,560 --> 01:38:00,440
haze from Ace um Ace seeds it like it

2275
01:37:58,359 --> 01:38:02,679
rocks my boat and when I smell it and I

2276
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:05,759
get in there I'm just like that is the

2277
01:38:02,679 --> 01:38:10,480
smell the look everything of what I

2278
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:14,000
remember cannabis to be as a kid um so

2279
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:16,759
that that you know so that that's in in

2280
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,920
in as much as I'd love for there to be

2281
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,960
like a

2282
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,560
stronger you know connection if someone

2283
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,039
came out of the Woodworks and said hey

2284
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:28,440
yeah I've got some seed that I got from

2285
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:29,840
Patrick Cassidy's 1974 Harvest and you

2286
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:32,638
know and that's what my big sir holy

2287
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:35,239
weed is today then yes you could just

2288
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:38,239
call that big sir holy weed and just be

2289
01:38:35,238 --> 01:38:40,519
just say it is you know but the reality

2290
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:43,519
is is what you look at where and how

2291
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:46,520
many people sold flour out of Big Sur as

2292
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:49,960
holy weed for how long and what the

2293
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:54,800
possible lineages could be it's

2294
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:57,198
everything you know and you know so

2295
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,840
that's that's just is what it is but but

2296
01:38:57,198 --> 01:39:01,839
the few things that the few things that

2297
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:04,800
survived like Dolores Mexican variety

2298
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:07,800
and chamba the African variety those

2299
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:11,880
things were selected and developed and

2300
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:14,880
kept somewhat isolated and they did have

2301
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:17,679
that big sir holy that time capsule

2302
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:21,520
thing from that period and those lines

2303
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:23,679
were worked in used in modern cannabis

2304
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:26,719
today and that's what's you know

2305
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:29,560
contributes to the sage that I grew and

2306
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:32,279
the breeding work I do today it's still

2307
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:34,800
every selection I make is towards that

2308
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:38,319
original profile so even though I've

2309
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,560
crossed Sage with chamba I've crossed

2310
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:42,559
Sage with OG I've crossed it with sour

2311
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,880
I've crossed it with Asian fantasy I've

2312
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,639
crossed it with a bunch of different

2313
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:47,719
things that are all over the

2314
01:39:45,639 --> 01:39:49,920
Spectrum the thing that I'm selecting

2315
01:39:47,719 --> 01:39:52,000
for just because I want to stay in my

2316
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,719
Lane because you know terpinolene is my

2317
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,279
jam and I love that you know the

2318
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:58,198
uplifting effect is I'm selecting for

2319
01:39:56,279 --> 01:40:00,359
that first sniff that I had in the

2320
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:03,439
corner in the courtyard in Amsterdam in

2321
01:40:00,359 --> 01:40:04,399
1994 where I was just like oh my God

2322
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:07,759
that's the

2323
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:09,759
smell and it's the same thing I'm that's

2324
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,639
that's what I want cannabis to be for me

2325
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,000
and I think that some people might enjoy

2326
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:15,480
it as

2327
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,279
well I love that I love that as a big

2328
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:20,718
fan of topen myself I'm I'm All About

2329
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:22,920
that I wanted to quickly ask before we

2330
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:24,920
moved on because the we had a few people

2331
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:27,158
ask this one on the patreon while we're

2332
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:30,399
talking about the big sir Holly weed

2333
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:32,238
they they saw that episode of uh where

2334
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:34,559
where you showed up to Jim Belushi's

2335
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:36,638
cannabis farm people wanted to know did

2336
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,080
you end up giving him some uh some big

2337
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:39,319
so Hollywood is there any chance they

2338
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:41,679
might be able to get it through his

2339
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:43,880
brand at one point and then as a

2340
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:46,920
followup you mentioned it earlier and I

2341
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:48,760
I made a note to loop back you said oh

2342
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:51,920
let there's there's a different story

2343
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:54,000
about the progression towards sensia I'd

2344
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,719
love to hear that in the area what was

2345
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,439
that like transitioning from seeded to

2346
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:02,639
seedless and how did that change the

2347
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:04,799
game yes um yeah well the I did let me

2348
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:07,560
just the the I did the episode with Jim

2349
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:11,400
balushi which was a total blast and I

2350
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:14,280
had a fantastic time and I you know I

2351
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:16,759
love working with Jim and all his team

2352
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:19,118
and I actually really appreciate what

2353
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:22,639
they're doing you know they're they're

2354
01:41:19,118 --> 01:41:26,559
really um kind of rare in cannabis and

2355
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:29,039
that they do see a big value in genetics

2356
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:31,679
and unique profiles and that they kind

2357
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:34,279
of want to differentiate themselves as a

2358
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:36,840
brand around that which is pretty pretty

2359
01:41:34,279 --> 01:41:41,559
wild you know he he really went out on a

2360
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:44,360
limb with the Colombian stuff and um so

2361
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:46,639
that that was really what motivated that

2362
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:48,920
in my working on that episode with them

2363
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:50,960
was that like these guys are for real

2364
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:54,319
they want better weed in their brand and

2365
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:57,158
they also want to tell the story um um

2366
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:59,198
and so yeah so I told the story on the

2367
01:41:57,158 --> 01:42:00,920
show you know it's a long story and it's

2368
01:41:59,198 --> 01:42:03,079
you know how TV goes so things get

2369
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:05,118
edited down but I tried to just kind of

2370
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:08,599
distill it down to the same thing I told

2371
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:12,198
you that it's not just one thing um it's

2372
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:14,440
kind of more a class or a region or or

2373
01:42:12,198 --> 01:42:19,759
or you know and yes I'm very much

2374
01:42:14,439 --> 01:42:23,399
working on getting um that into in into

2375
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:25,199
um blushi farms for sure um because I'm

2376
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:28,319
I'm super passionate about people

2377
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:29,799
getting you know access to what at least

2378
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,559
some people think is really you know

2379
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:34,719
worldclass cannabis I do think that you

2380
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,320
know even if it's in small batches

2381
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:39,639
people should have the ability to try it

2382
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:41,118
and so yeah I'm working towards getting

2383
01:42:39,639 --> 01:42:43,039
it's been a long it's been a long

2384
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,000
journey you know with me with sage we've

2385
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:48,439
been we've been dancing together for 30

2386
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,039
years so I keep a catalog alive and I do

2387
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:53,839
continue to do some breeding work and I

2388
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:55,079
I think that we're going to see uh um

2389
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:56,599
you know just like we're having this

2390
01:42:55,079 --> 01:42:58,479
conversation I'm having this

2391
01:42:56,599 --> 01:43:01,560
conversation more often that we're going

2392
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:04,519
to see brands in the market and the

2393
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:07,400
consumer slowly starting to ask you know

2394
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:09,960
for for different options you know so

2395
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:14,399
I'm I'm excited to try and make that

2396
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:17,679
happen um and the uh what was the other

2397
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:22,118
half sorry that question you oh CIA

2398
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:25,359
yes so this is um CIA was a book written

2399
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:27,000
in I I should grab let me grab a copy

2400
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:29,359
off the shelf so I don't butcher this

2401
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,880
really quick sounds

2402
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:35,960
good

2403
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:38,679
so sensia marijuana flowers it's a book

2404
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,158
by Richardson and woods I have a hard

2405
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:43,399
time with the names because they're not

2406
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:46,920
real names they're aliases photography

2407
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:49,079
by Eric Woods um marijuana flowers by

2408
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:52,440
Jim Richardson it's a great book it's

2409
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:53,719
the first time that I'm aware of and

2410
01:43:52,439 --> 01:43:56,279
others have

2411
01:43:53,719 --> 01:44:00,359
um agree that's the first time that the

2412
01:43:56,279 --> 01:44:03,960
the tech on pulling males was widely

2413
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:07,479
disseminated that people didn't know how

2414
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,800
to make seedless cannabis and um

2415
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:10,678
obviously you know people had grown

2416
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:12,599
plenty of seedless cannabis just because

2417
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:14,800
the law of averages you know you flip a

2418
01:44:12,599 --> 01:44:17,480
coin you know you're likely to get a

2419
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,119
heads pretty often or a tails and plenty

2420
01:44:17,479 --> 01:44:22,118
of people I'm sure just had a female in

2421
01:44:19,118 --> 01:44:24,960
the backyard and grew and smoked you

2422
01:44:22,118 --> 01:44:28,319
know seedless and I know it goes back

2423
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:30,359
far into literature into you know that

2424
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:32,799
we we we've known how to make seedless

2425
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:35,158
cannabis um for a while but the in

2426
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:37,920
modern world it wasn't something that

2427
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:40,319
was widely known and even most of the

2428
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,719
Imports CIA that people brought in

2429
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:46,519
usually had some

2430
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:52,118
seeds um but the story I was told was in

2431
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:55,760
1974 or so um a batch of Tai weed

2432
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:59,639
entered into to um big

2433
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:01,639
sir and the people who purchased it were

2434
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:06,880
like totally blown away at how seedless

2435
01:45:01,639 --> 01:45:09,359
it was and they um through the Importer

2436
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,159
contacted the Growers and The Growers

2437
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:15,519
basically told them the easy you know

2438
01:45:11,158 --> 01:45:18,719
pull a mail that's it simple simple so

2439
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:23,040
um I'm not sure why the word cmia was

2440
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:26,639
already known um and why there's not a

2441
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:28,639
Thai word in the book um but as far as I

2442
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:32,000
know that's where the authors got the

2443
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:33,880
idea was from Thai flower and obviously

2444
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,560
they'd been smoking s Amia and in the

2445
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:38,118
market I guess that word was heavily

2446
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:40,760
used already for seedless or less

2447
01:45:38,118 --> 01:45:43,719
seedless flow so as soon as they knew

2448
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:46,960
how to do it they um they did it it has

2449
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:49,359
a forward the forward is from um from

2450
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:54,118
David Crosby actually of Crosby Stills

2451
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:55,679
and Ash um and so anyway this was the

2452
01:45:54,118 --> 01:45:58,880
first time that they really you know

2453
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,399
spread the word and um the far out part

2454
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,920
is when they learned about it they knew

2455
01:46:00,399 --> 01:46:05,158
right away like oh we need to grow a

2456
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:07,760
crop and photograph the crop and then

2457
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:09,359
write a book you know it wasn't like

2458
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,360
they were doing it and then they just

2459
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:14,238
documented it it's like they literally

2460
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:16,039
did they they grew this crop for the

2461
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:17,638
purpose of photographing it for the

2462
01:46:16,039 --> 01:46:18,639
purpose of writing this book for the

2463
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:22,639
purpose of

2464
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:24,359
sharing um the concept of pulling males

2465
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,239
so so as far as I know from all the old

2466
01:46:24,359 --> 01:46:29,759
Cali Growers and stuff that I know this

2467
01:46:26,238 --> 01:46:31,238
is where they learned how to make cmia

2468
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,920
was from this one book and there were

2469
01:46:31,238 --> 01:46:36,879
some family friends um uh so yeah that

2470
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,399
was a interesting little I just and I I

2471
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,079
just learned this just recently a couple

2472
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:41,799
years ago that it was thae flower I

2473
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:43,760
never knew I always assumed it was just

2474
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,520
Mexican flower that they had contacted

2475
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,520
someone in Mexico and I know there's

2476
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,159
other stories for how other people had

2477
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:52,239
shared the knowledge and stuff but as

2478
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:55,439
far as I know this book was the first

2479
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:56,799
time in Bob and David also and Mel Frank

2480
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:58,559
and all these guys they all they all

2481
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,480
agree this was the first time that was

2482
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,480
widely

2483
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:06,959
distributed wow and I mean how how did

2484
01:47:03,479 --> 01:47:09,359
it change the landscape like for example

2485
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:11,000
was there an immediate realization that

2486
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:12,799
the value of the crop had gone up

2487
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,920
significantly or was there like a year

2488
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,199
or two of delay because I'm assuming

2489
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:19,520
when you gave that story I I see it in

2490
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:21,960
my mind perfectly someone just has one

2491
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,159
plant in the backyard it's a female

2492
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,760
they're sitting around with their mates

2493
01:47:23,158 --> 01:47:27,319
and they're like wow it was really good

2494
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:31,239
this year wasn't it like not not exactly

2495
01:47:27,319 --> 01:47:32,719
sure why um was it the same thing when

2496
01:47:31,238 --> 01:47:34,319
they pulled the MS it took a minute

2497
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:37,359
before they were like hey we actually

2498
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:38,599
got something here or like how did that

2499
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:40,920
go and and was there any other

2500
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:43,440
unexpected repercussions or flow on

2501
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:45,399
effects I mean I don't know I'd have to

2502
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:47,638
go and get back and do some research in

2503
01:47:45,399 --> 01:47:50,279
the community but if from what I heard

2504
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:51,840
it was around 74 and this book was

2505
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:56,000
published in

2506
01:47:51,840 --> 01:48:00,000
76 so they grew the crop in

2507
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:01,880
75 um and at that point by 75 people

2508
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,359
were growing a lot of cannabis and big S

2509
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:08,118
all over the place you know and so it

2510
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:10,719
was just seated weed everywhere so from

2511
01:48:08,118 --> 01:48:13,399
what I gather it happened right away I

2512
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:15,158
mean it's just like uh you know like the

2513
01:48:13,399 --> 01:48:17,519
internet turning on or something once

2514
01:48:15,158 --> 01:48:20,719
people realize oh no this is a mail pull

2515
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,920
your males it became pretty quick

2516
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,359
obviously you know people aren't always

2517
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,599
going to be successful in doing that and

2518
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:27,439
they're going to leave males that they

2519
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:29,079
didn't you know know were there get

2520
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:31,238
pollinated by their neighbors or stuff

2521
01:48:29,079 --> 01:48:33,760
like that but no I think it was pretty

2522
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:36,279
widely adapted and not just by the

2523
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:39,000
locals in Big Sur I mean it just it

2524
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:41,039
spread around the world and everybody

2525
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,158
quickly realized like duh oh my God is

2526
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:45,198
that easy that's all I have to do it

2527
01:48:43,158 --> 01:48:46,920
just pull the males but then I'm sure

2528
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:48,519
the big the next big you know thing was

2529
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:50,279
like oh my god I've got to pull half of

2530
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:53,040
my crop I got to plant half a crop and

2531
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:56,800
then kill it like I didn't really think

2532
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:59,118
it that way um so yeah no that was that

2533
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:01,119
was a big thing and I'm sure you know

2534
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:02,839
that that it's interesting though but

2535
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:06,880
that happened right around the same time

2536
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:11,920
that camp started ramping up and Big Sir

2537
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:14,679
got hot and you know in actually in

2538
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:17,480
1977 there was an article in LA Times

2539
01:49:14,679 --> 01:49:20,599
about the Harvest parties you know and

2540
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:22,959
it was full you know colored pictures in

2541
01:49:20,599 --> 01:49:24,400
in the in the newspaper like hey these

2542
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:27,800
hippies are just like growing weed up

2543
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:30,439
here and having a big party you know um

2544
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:32,679
so Camp got really heavy you know and

2545
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:34,279
they started um busting people and

2546
01:49:32,679 --> 01:49:37,158
ripping plants out of the ground right

2547
01:49:34,279 --> 01:49:39,399
at that same time so right when when

2548
01:49:37,158 --> 01:49:41,719
everyone was kind of like learning how

2549
01:49:39,399 --> 01:49:43,638
to grow cannabis and getting better seed

2550
01:49:41,719 --> 01:49:46,439
and you know making their own crosses

2551
01:49:43,639 --> 01:49:48,400
and establishing their own little their

2552
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:51,198
own little production they had to go and

2553
01:49:48,399 --> 01:49:54,198
run deep deep deep into the hills into

2554
01:49:51,198 --> 01:50:00,079
this new model of Gorilla growing which

2555
01:49:54,198 --> 01:50:01,759
is like was all about uh growing and not

2556
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:04,000
it was no more it wasn't about botney

2557
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:06,599
and horiculture anymore it was about not

2558
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,719
getting busted just that was it right

2559
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:11,599
100% so like it was like my first

2560
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:13,520
memories of seeing plants like you know

2561
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:15,360
commercial production I don't like to me

2562
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,960
it looked like a field but I'm sure it

2563
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:20,519
wasn't that big but it was definitely

2564
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:23,520
rows of cannabis like grown in a patch

2565
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:26,840
like all in one place in like the mid

2566
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:29,480
late 70s but then by the just a few lat

2567
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:31,920
years later you never saw that you just

2568
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:33,598
saw a plant here and up plant there and

2569
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:35,800
up plant here they were just scattered

2570
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:38,679
around on the hillside with this you

2571
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:40,480
know all this drip line connecting

2572
01:50:38,679 --> 01:50:43,480
everything and just the whole idea of

2573
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:45,598
just kind of growing cannabis where you

2574
01:50:43,479 --> 01:50:48,359
could kind of tend to it like a gardener

2575
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:50,639
or end to it like a farmer have it next

2576
01:50:48,359 --> 01:50:52,359
to your home you know next to your your

2577
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:55,800
vegetable garden for instance that was

2578
01:50:52,359 --> 01:50:57,679
all gone and it quickly became you know

2579
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,400
growing cannabis was about dressing up

2580
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:01,279
in camos and going out in the middle of

2581
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:04,319
the night and carrying chicken wire and

2582
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:07,319
drip line way way way out into the into

2583
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:09,000
the Backwoods in order to not get busted

2584
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:10,679
which you can imagine like that changes

2585
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,560
everything in terms of like what the

2586
01:51:10,679 --> 01:51:15,880
plant needs to be and how to grow the

2587
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:17,960
plant what what type of plant to grow um

2588
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,279
just everything changed you know

2589
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:21,520
different that's that's where I can't

2590
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:25,198
get over like this whole how much

2591
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:27,679
prohibition shape not just the gene pool

2592
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,919
but what we consider to be cannabis what

2593
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:32,000
we want from Cannabis you know how we

2594
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:34,679
interface and engage cannabis it's all

2595
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,920
just either an artifact of prohibition

2596
01:51:34,679 --> 01:51:40,118
or blowback from

2597
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:43,399
prohibition um so

2598
01:51:40,118 --> 01:51:46,559
yeah yeah I mean totally totally it's

2599
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:51,638
it's hard to understate the impact it's

2600
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:54,719
it's had isn't it I wanted to ask what

2601
01:51:51,639 --> 01:51:57,800
like you obviously grew up so heavily

2602
01:51:54,719 --> 01:52:01,198
surrounded by all of this what was the

2603
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:03,520
stimulus for you to think I need I need

2604
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,638
to head to Europe was it all of this

2605
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:08,199
prohibition around you I'm assuming you

2606
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:09,760
were probably near at the end of high

2607
01:52:08,198 --> 01:52:11,879
school when you started thinking about

2608
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,400
going to Amsterdam what was that

2609
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:15,239
transition like from being a kid

2610
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:19,118
surrounded by it in California to

2611
01:52:15,238 --> 01:52:21,039
thinking I got to go to Europe um well

2612
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:23,399
cannabis in California had gotten really

2613
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:26,719
crazy in the 80s because of all the zero

2614
01:52:23,399 --> 01:52:29,158
tolerance laws and stuff so it became

2615
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:31,760
less fun that's for sure I mean like

2616
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:37,078
just there was the stress around it was

2617
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:39,480
pretty pretty intense um but for me um

2618
01:52:37,078 --> 01:52:43,198
my childhood friend Adam Dunn had moved

2619
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:45,598
to the to Amsterdam and you know he

2620
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:47,598
would send me postcards and we would

2621
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:49,199
chat and he'd come and visit me from

2622
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:50,599
time to time and he was always just like

2623
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:53,598
come on out it's insane you won't

2624
01:52:50,599 --> 01:52:56,199
believe it and was always kind of like

2625
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:59,360
yeah you know I'm I'm uh thinking about

2626
01:52:56,198 --> 01:53:02,719
it one day I'll get out there and um I

2627
01:52:59,359 --> 01:53:05,519
also had a family friend um my dad was a

2628
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:07,000
musician and back in Big Sir had a band

2629
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,480
and they're called Big Sir light and

2630
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:12,560
power and the guitar player was Al

2631
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:15,559
shakman who was also um Nina Simone's

2632
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:18,760
lifetime guitar player and Al was living

2633
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:20,719
in Paris and I had um met up with alen

2634
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:22,520
LA and he basically said come on out to

2635
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:24,560
Paris and all he was outside of Paris

2636
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:26,079
somewhere he said come on out and I'll

2637
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:27,639
you know I'll be your mentor and I'll

2638
01:53:26,078 --> 01:53:31,198
teach you jazz guitar and you can come

2639
01:53:27,639 --> 01:53:33,039
and stay with me and um so Adam was

2640
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:36,039
saying come to Amsterdam and Al was

2641
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:38,319
saying come to France and I was kind of

2642
01:53:36,039 --> 01:53:40,639
wavering and then one day I just came

2643
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:42,439
home and someone stole my my truck with

2644
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:44,039
all my tools in it I was working as a

2645
01:53:42,439 --> 01:53:46,198
doing carpentry and stuff of the time

2646
01:53:44,039 --> 01:53:48,319
and the second I saw and I saw the truck

2647
01:53:46,198 --> 01:53:50,559
driving away and just like just like a

2648
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:53,118
lightning Flash and like boom Amsterdam

2649
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:56,639
I'm going I'm out of here

2650
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:59,279
and I got a um um and I was 23 at the

2651
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:00,960
time um I got a one-way ticket and I

2652
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:03,158
told my friends and family I said I'm

2653
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,800
going to be gone for probably a month no

2654
01:54:03,158 --> 01:54:08,679
more no more than a

2655
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:11,440
year um and I end up staying for six

2656
01:54:08,679 --> 01:54:13,359
years um but anyway I came to Amsterdam

2657
01:54:11,439 --> 01:54:18,039
just to hang out and see the scene to

2658
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:20,960
see what it was like um which was wild

2659
01:54:18,039 --> 01:54:23,760
um just Queen's Day you know oh my God

2660
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:27,399
just the things the fun we had you know

2661
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:29,800
all the all the old squat parties and

2662
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:32,559
and uh you know just Amsterdam in the

2663
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:33,960
early 90s was just a blast and I had a

2664
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,760
really good time there for a few months

2665
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:40,560
and then I went and hitchhiked down to

2666
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:43,239
Paris in your classic you know American

2667

01:54:53,078 --> 01:54:58,000
had been Comm I had been communicating

2673
01:54:54,719 --> 01:55:00,679
with Al via postcard and phone cards you

2674
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,520

2679
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:17,480
Al had moved back to the US somewhat

2680
01:55:13,479 --> 01:55:19,959
abruptly and I was just kind of stranded

2681
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:21,839
in Paris with like no money and my

2682
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,960
guitar and a backpack and just like kind

2683
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:26,039
of like hm what what should I do now you

2684
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:29,960
know I was I really came here to do

2685
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:35,319
music and I just kind of contacted

2686
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:37,760
Adam and um decided I had a met a girl

2687
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:40,279
who was um working at ciny seeds at the

2688
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:41,520
time Monica and I called her up and

2689
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:44,679
she's like why don't you come up here

2690
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:48,320
and just hang out and we became a

2691
01:55:44,679 --> 01:55:51,719
couple and within a few months I started

2692
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:54,238
growing cannabis indoors and then a few

2693
01:55:51,719 --> 01:55:57,279
months later I started PL popping seeds

2694
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:59,678
in the backyard and a few months later I

2695
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:02,198
built up another little grow and you

2696
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:04,158
know I was just I had settled and then I

2697
01:56:02,198 --> 01:56:06,238
decided I was never coming back I you

2698
01:56:04,158 --> 01:56:08,039
know I loved Amsterdam so much I decided

2699
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:13,279
I would live there for the rest of my

2700
01:56:08,039 --> 01:56:17,078
life um and was found Sage which was fun

2701
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:18,920
because it was something new and um all

2702
01:56:17,078 --> 01:56:20,599
that you know Cannabis Cup stuff was

2703
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,960
going on and the culture was kind of

2704
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:23,840
growing there was kind of a buzz in the

2705
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:26,599
city it was this epicenter it was really

2706
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:29,199
cool and Adam was well connected and new

2707
01:56:26,599 --> 01:56:31,360
people and started his hemp clothing

2708
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:34,319
company um it's just a really exciting

2709
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:36,759
time to be there and then prop 215

2710
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:39,439
happened and California you know made

2711
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:42,599
this big shift and I started thinking

2712
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:44,439
about why I was in Amsterdam and you

2713
01:56:42,599 --> 01:56:46,639
know kind of missing family and missing

2714
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:49,399
geography missing the mountains and the

2715
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:52,319
coast and stuff like that and decided to

2716
01:56:49,399 --> 01:56:54,759
come back and try my hand at you know

2717
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:57,519
doing what I was doing in Amsterdam in

2718
01:56:54,760 --> 01:57:00,719
California um which is kind of what

2719
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,880
brought me back here and I brought seeds

2720
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:05,480
brought sage seeds back and continued to

2721
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:08,560
breed and just kept moving

2722
01:57:05,479 --> 01:57:11,678
forward let me quickly ask one question

2723
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:14,880
before we continue on which is what was

2724
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:18,319
the creation of sage like you know can

2725
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:20,599
you take us through the steps of was it

2726
01:57:18,319 --> 01:57:23,000
was it planned was it just like a happy

2727
01:57:20,599 --> 01:57:25,319
accident was it the case that you pop

2728
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,520
one of the parents and then thought oh I

2729
01:57:25,319 --> 01:57:29,719
got to work with this like how did it

2730
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:32,639
sort of go down well it was after

2731
01:57:29,719 --> 01:57:34,399
growing indoors for a couple cycles and

2732
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:36,679
you know coming from a com being a

2733
01:57:34,399 --> 01:57:39,359
California boy I wanted to grow outside

2734
01:57:36,679 --> 01:57:42,239
and I wanted to grow from seed so I

2735
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:44,759
basically accumulated a bunch of seed

2736
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:46,839
from random places it was all nothing

2737
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:49,520
purchased never not a single I've never

2738
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:52,319
bought a seed in my entire life um there

2739
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:54,920
were seeds that were gifted to me seeds

2740
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:58,559
that fell out of a joint that I was

2741
01:57:54,920 --> 01:58:02,319
rolling and I had a few of them that

2742
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:05,679
were unlabeled but

2743
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:07,238
segregated meaning like I would like if

2744
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:09,158
something was special I'd wrap it up in

2745
01:58:07,238 --> 01:58:11,158
like a little rolling paper or something

2746
01:58:09,158 --> 01:58:14,799
to designate it from just being another

2747
01:58:11,158 --> 01:58:18,359
seed right and when I planted in the

2748
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:21,039
backyard 100 or so seeds and in the

2749
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:22,719
corner I planted in pots instead of the

2750
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:25,319
ground a few of these

2751
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:29,279
I think this might be special kind of

2752
01:58:25,319 --> 01:58:31,840
seeds um but one of those seeds didn't

2753
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:33,759
grow very much it was just sitting in

2754
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:36,440
the corner in too big of a pot probably

2755
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:40,000
germinated late and was just

2756
01:58:36,439 --> 01:58:42,399
struggling um and that was the one that

2757
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,639
I smelled and had the flower that that

2758
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:46,439
smell and I right away luckily I'd

2759
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:48,920
already you know I'd been kind of diving

2760
01:58:46,439 --> 01:58:50,439
in big into learning about how to grow

2761
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:53,960
and got all the grow books I could and

2762
01:58:50,439 --> 01:58:57,039
I'd already met Rob and all these people

2763
01:58:53,960 --> 01:59:00,118
and so I knew about revegging plants so

2764
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:03,279
I plucked off enough flower off that one

2765
01:59:00,118 --> 01:59:05,719
little plant in order to dry it and

2766
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:08,719
smoked it and right away it was just

2767
01:59:05,719 --> 01:59:10,960
like holy [ __ ] this is really special by

2768
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:13,880
far the best thing out of the whole

2769
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:18,039
backyard um and I started to rev it it

2770
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:21,199
slowly slowly crawled out of flour and

2771
01:59:18,039 --> 01:59:24,960
reved and grew out the mom made some

2772
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:26,678
cuts and did an indoor round and the

2773
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,118
rest is history it was didn't have a

2774
01:59:26,679 --> 01:59:29,880
name for it at

2775
01:59:28,118 --> 01:59:31,399
first

2776
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:34,319
um

2777
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:37,238
and sold it I think I think at the first

2778
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:38,759
time I sold it I sold it as Maui Mist I

2779
01:59:37,238 --> 01:59:41,198
think because the gray area had just

2780
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:42,679
opened up the coffee shop and they

2781
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:46,198
wanted to sell some but we didn't have a

2782
01:59:42,679 --> 01:59:48,920
name and it was similar to a haze or

2783
01:59:46,198 --> 01:59:49,919
a c mist or something so we called it

2784
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:53,760
Maui

2785
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:56,880
Mist um but it had that SA age smell

2786
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:59,000
once again that not only reminded me of

2787
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:01,359
this flower from Big Sir but it also

2788
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:05,560
reminded me of Big Sir itself the The

2789
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:07,359
Sage Brush kind of um chapparel smell

2790
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:12,480
which is terpinolene is in you know

2791
02:00:07,359 --> 02:00:14,198
Salvia the sage plant um so um one night

2792
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:16,439
I just kind of had this Epiphany and I'd

2793
02:00:14,198 --> 02:00:18,960
been reading you know and and meeting

2794
02:00:16,439 --> 02:00:20,479
Rob and meeting um and learning about

2795
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:25,000
cannabis

2796
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:27,238
um and really liked the a the um

2797
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
afghanica as opposed to Indica because I

2798
02:00:27,238 --> 02:00:30,598
was always puzzled as a kid I remember

2799
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,039
seeing products and grocery stores

2800
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:34,760
called Indica there was like Inda rice

2801
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:37,039
and it would say right on the label Inda

2802
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:39,639
rice is a type of rice grown in India

2803
02:00:37,039 --> 02:00:40,840
you know explaining what Indica meant so

2804
02:00:39,639 --> 02:00:42,400
I always thought it was kind of puzzling

2805
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:46,560
that all these plants from Afghanistan

2806
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:49,519
were called Indica so once just smelling

2807
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:50,880
sage and having this sagey smell that me

2808
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,719
and Adam were talking about like oh it's

2809
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:57,000
got the sagey smell I just thought of

2810
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:58,960
the the acronym an acronym um sativa

2811
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,880
afghanica genetic

2812
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:03,480
equilibrium because it was it had a

2813
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:06,679
strong sativa

2814
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:10,519
effect um but it was chunky and it came

2815
02:01:06,679 --> 02:01:13,520
in under 70 days so it had the Afghan

2816
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:16,400
influence on the agronomic side but it

2817
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:18,880
had the sativa influence on the effect

2818
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:21,158
so then I had a female an all you know a

2819
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,560
female that was growing and you know by

2820
02:01:21,158 --> 02:01:25,479
that point um th seeds was already in

2821
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:28,800
business and just the idea was like well

2822
02:01:25,479 --> 02:01:33,319
we should turn this into a seed line um

2823
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:36,880
so I used the chamba um Afghan cross and

2824
02:01:33,319 --> 02:01:44,238
found a mail from that

2825
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:47,440
and found a sage uh Sage times chamba um

2826
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:49,559
female and a sage times chamba male and

2827
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:52,559
I believe I back crossed that male

2828
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:55,119
against the sage female

2829
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:58,039
and from there I found I believe is

2830
02:01:55,118 --> 02:02:00,078
where the sage male and the sage female

2831
02:01:58,039 --> 02:02:03,279
came that would eventually used be used

2832
02:02:00,078 --> 02:02:07,880
to make the seeds for sage for th

2833
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:10,078
seeds um so it's like uh it's 12 and a

2834
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:12,880
half% chamba I

2835
02:02:10,078 --> 02:02:15,078
think um yeah I have the lineage

2836
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,359
somewhere I I could figure it out but

2837
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:21,439
but yeah wow is it's kind of like a like

2838
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:23,359
a sage bx1 F2 almost by the sounds of it

2839
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:27,000
yeah yeah that's that's about exactly

2840
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:30,279
what it is yep cool okay and I mean Gosh

2841
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,479
Look it's it's a a very popular strain

2842
02:02:30,279 --> 02:02:34,198
like people know about it I don't know

2843
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:35,678
if you're if you know the numbers and

2844
02:02:34,198 --> 02:02:38,000
I'm not exactly looking for them but

2845
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:40,560
like would you say that it was certainly

2846
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,560
commercially successful or was it just a

2847
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:46,599
strain that people happen to know a lot

2848
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:48,360
about um I mean it when I was growing it

2849
02:02:46,599 --> 02:02:50,119
in Amsterdam it created a buzz cuz it

2850
02:02:48,359 --> 02:02:52,359
was something new and it was good and a

2851
02:02:50,118 --> 02:02:53,839
lot of people wanted to smoke it and and

2852
02:02:52,359 --> 02:02:55,799
there was definitely hype I mean there

2853
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:58,239
was people you know trying to buy cuts

2854
02:02:55,800 --> 02:03:01,560
and stuff like that

2855
02:02:58,238 --> 02:03:03,839
um and then a lot of people who bought

2856
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:05,400
seeds were able to find really special

2857
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,279
varieties there's a lot of diversity in

2858
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:11,039
there as you could tell just by looking

2859
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:12,920
at that that cross um so there's a lot

2860
02:03:11,039 --> 02:03:16,319
to sort through let's just say that

2861
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:18,480
right it's not a homozygous line at all

2862
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:20,359
um but in that sorting there's a lot of

2863
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:22,919
really magical stuff that all still

2864
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:27,039
still kind of in that one spectrum of

2865
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:30,158
that Sage class that tpine kind of thing

2866
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:32,319
um so little pockets people found it and

2867
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:36,078
it was really different and it was a

2868
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:41,359
great breeding tool because it had this

2869
02:03:36,078 --> 02:03:43,719
kind of soaring effect and um you know I

2870
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:46,158
I had more I had more luck with the

2871
02:03:43,719 --> 02:03:50,000
crosses I made with it than just the P

2872
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:51,319
age just because um you know and I I

2873
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,679
think you could say the same maybe for

2874
02:03:51,319 --> 02:03:56,920
th seeds like sage and sour really

2875
02:03:53,679 --> 02:04:00,039
nailed it and that brought both of those

2876
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:02,800
worlds together um I've had some other

2877
02:04:00,039 --> 02:04:06,118
Sage sour crosses um from other people

2878
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:08,599
that were really amazing um and the I

2879
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:13,039
used OG quite a bit in Crossing with

2880
02:04:08,599 --> 02:04:15,920
sage but always selected for um Sage

2881
02:04:13,039 --> 02:04:18,359
traits um on the Kim on the on the

2882
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:23,239
effect side um so it was a really good

2883
02:04:18,359 --> 02:04:27,679
breeding parent to bring um some of that

2884
02:04:23,238 --> 02:04:30,118
hazy sativa side into your hybrids you

2885
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:32,359
know um so that's what you started to

2886
02:04:30,118 --> 02:04:37,198
see a lot of these you know the the

2887
02:04:32,359 --> 02:04:38,479
folos AG and um I'm trying to think of

2888
02:04:37,198 --> 02:04:40,339
what is the other one that's kind of

2889
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:41,638
popular that was going around the

2890
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:46,719
[Music]

2891
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:48,239
um uh God it's a a rename um yeah I

2892
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:49,840
can't remember but there's a there's a

2893
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:51,319
there's things and I run into people all

2894
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,880
the time who tell who tell me there's

2895
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:55,639
things in their line that Sage is in

2896
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:58,760
their line like I know Green b a lot of

2897
02:04:55,639 --> 02:05:02,078
his stuff has sage in it um I know all

2898
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:06,000
the sour best [ __ ] ever sbse that has

2899
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:08,198
sage in it um you know so it became a

2900
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,039
part of things more than it became

2901
02:05:08,198 --> 02:05:13,238
something on its own um and I think that

2902
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:15,519
kind of also speaks just to the need

2903
02:05:13,238 --> 02:05:19,198
agronomically to create hybrids for the

2904
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:23,360
market it's just really hard to stay in

2905
02:05:19,198 --> 02:05:26,678
the the later flowering world

2906
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:31,279
um but to me you know to me sage and

2907
02:05:26,679 --> 02:05:33,078
Hayes and Jack and um Durban and train

2908
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:36,039
wreck and all these things they're all

2909
02:05:33,078 --> 02:05:38,198
in this kind of trening class and some

2910
02:05:36,039 --> 02:05:39,920
of them work better for growers in some

2911
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:42,799
ways and some of and also they've all

2912
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:44,520
been mixed up by the way you know

2913
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,639
there's there's definitely train wreck

2914
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:49,800
out there that is Sage you know and

2915
02:05:47,639 --> 02:05:51,480
that's that's happened a few times and

2916
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:53,079
that happens just like there's durans

2917
02:05:51,479 --> 02:05:54,519
out out there that aren't Durban and

2918
02:05:53,078 --> 02:05:56,558
there's Jacks that are Durban and Durbin

2919
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:59,719
that are Jacks and stuff so that that

2920
02:05:56,559 --> 02:06:02,800
terpinolene signature kind of became a

2921
02:05:59,719 --> 02:06:04,639
you know a thing you know so I know

2922
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:08,520
people who've used it to breed into

2923
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:10,480
their other tpine dominant lines um just

2924
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:13,040
because it brings I think I think the

2925
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:15,439
one big attribute that Sage had in terms

2926
02:06:13,039 --> 02:06:17,559
of you know what it offered that Hayes

2927
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:20,198
didn't was it was earlier flowering and

2928
02:06:17,559 --> 02:06:22,599
chunkier but still had that same soaring

2929
02:06:20,198 --> 02:06:24,960
effect

2930
02:06:22,599 --> 02:06:27,199
yeah nice nice and I like the way you

2931
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:29,118
said you know it's sort of it's worked

2932
02:06:27,198 --> 02:06:31,399
its way into many things more than being

2933
02:06:29,118 --> 02:06:33,158
its own thing I think that's sort of all

2934
02:06:31,399 --> 02:06:34,679
you can really hope for as a breeder

2935
02:06:33,158 --> 02:06:38,000
really right cuz nothing's going to stay

2936
02:06:34,679 --> 02:06:39,559
around forever unless you made OG and

2937
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,880
let's face it we're not all going to be

2938
02:06:39,559 --> 02:06:41,880

2939
