thank you for having me so first

48
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,118
question as always you probably know

49
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,560
what it is

50
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,560
what was your introduction to cannabis

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,680
right probably about um

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,759
14 uh smoking with friends

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,040
um would have been some moroccan hush

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,280
mixed with tobacco um

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
that's the sort of way that a lot of

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
people in the uk

57
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,598
sort of smoked it at that time

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,599
so yeah that was the first experience

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,560
didn't really get

60
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,598
high from it and probably too much

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,039
tobacco

62
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:24,079
mixed with it but probably

63
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,799
two weeks three weeks after that and

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,599
same group of friends we got together

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,760
and we smoked it in a bong and

66
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:37,839
i definitely got high anyway i couldn't

67
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,840
move off that couch for a while

68
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,518
i don't suppose you remember what

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,560
strains were going around back then was

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,319
it just

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
just whatever i mean back in the days of

72
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,759
hash there kind of wasn't really strains

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,879
but i don't know

74
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,639
what was it no we had we had a lot of

75
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,159
like import

76
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,518
like thai steak coming in and also

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,639
like brickweed from

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,519
africa and places like this um

79
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,000
very seeded but um the first time i ever

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,039
smoked the african

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,840
like i got a high that was unlike

82
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,759
anything i'd experienced from hash

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
the feeling in my legs the tingling

84
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,959
feelings

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,080
almost like psychedelic to some extent

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,080
and from that day i just

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
always ask the guy can can you get more

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
of this this this is the stuff that i

89
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,518
want to smoke i don't want to be smoking

90
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,158
the hash anymore

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
um so that's what i've tried to find

92
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,039
more of

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,799
um but at the time there wasn't really

94
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,798
any skunk or anything like this

95
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,158
so that's interesting there's like a few

96
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,840
points in that one i guess it goes

97
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,158
without saying your favorite land race

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,799
is african

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,479
um yes because of the memories it being

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,239
brings back definitely and the high

101
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,359
the high that it has it has something

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,640
special about the african wheats

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
the thing which is really interesting

104
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,318
about the africans is there's actually a

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,280
fair bit of diversity within the african

106
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,280
land races but

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,878
you know obviously durban poison just

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,719
gets the main wrap

109
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,318
do you think it was durban poison that

110
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,759
you smoked as a kid or something else

111
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,438
because the thing which people often

112
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,358
mention about durban poison is

113
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,639
it's not all that potent so based off

114
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,399
your story i would almost

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
tend to think it probably wasn't what do

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,918
you think

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,279
no i'm gonna say it was probably

118
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,478
something like

119
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,758
like a malawi interesting and you think

120
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,199
it was like the full-on

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,560
cobb type thing or just some malawi

122
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,439
um well because of the color of it

123
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,839
um it had this like almost golden edge

124
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,759
to it

125
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,599
so from

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,439
looking into it a little bit more i'd

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,000
say it could have been some sort of

128
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,519
malawi cobb type thing

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,279
okay interesting have you ever toyed

130
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,079
around with doing that yourself with any

131
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,119
modern stuff

132
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,839
like you doing the cobb method we did me

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,800
and a friend

134
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,519
a friend of mine grew out of malawi gold

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,360
and he vegeta outside in the uk

136
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,599
or for most of the season and brought it

137
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,160
in to flower it at the end

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,400
and flowered it for like almost 22 weeks

139
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,680
and the plant was huge it was just one

140
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:20,560
plant growing under four or four hundred

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,360
and yeah again the high off that was

142
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,959
amazing

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,038
and we tried to make some cobs out of

144
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,560
that and bury him in the ground

145
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,959
so yeah that was that was a fun

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
experience that's full on

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,120
and so have you ever considered trying

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,319
to find that stuff and breed with it or

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,478
is it just considered

150
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,560
gone in your mind um i do have some

151
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,519
malawi seeds that a friend collected

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,519
while he was

153
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:48,879
out in malawi um i'm yet to start them

154
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:52,079
they're they're still in the collection

155
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,478
um hope to pop them maybe one day soon

156
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,318
and so if we rewind back what was your

157
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,359
first grow like you know what strains

158
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,240
were you running and what type of

159
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,240
technology were you using

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,199
okay um so the first strain

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,319
would have been okay okay this is how it

162
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
uh

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,879
it came my friend was growing out the

164
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,839
strain we did we got a light

165
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,639
we'd set it up in his room and we were

166
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,599
growing a

167
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,120
tight some thai seeds but at this time

168
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
we hadn't really figured out the whole

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
12

170
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,519
12 thing and if the plant was just

171
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,239
growing

172
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,279
and we sort of scrapped the idea after

173
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,639
that

174
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:36,159
later on i got some hindu cush seeds

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,519
and i found a book um

176
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,439
in an old little bookstore and

177
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,758
this book like said in it about the

178
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,839
whole 12 12 light regime

179
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,919
and it was just like a light bulb moment

180
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,318
i got my plant i got the hindu kush

181
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,839
seeds planted them

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,840
and set up the light and away i went and

183
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,119
i was basically just feeding it basic

184
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,918
stuff here it's like

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,280
i got some chicken poo i got some wood

186
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,359
ash

187
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,719
and that's what i was basically feeding

188
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,360
the plant it was very basic

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
and so just to fast forward for a quick

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
second

191
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:18,399
what's your growth style now you know

192
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:21,840
are you organic bottled synthetic

193
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,879
um i've pretty much grown every single

194
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,638
way

195
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,959
and for the last couple years i've been

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,960
doing a lot of cocoa growing

197
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:34,000
um using bottled feeds and

198
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,918
also did a bit of hydro but this was

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,959
more to do with like really

200
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:42,478
testing my plants and seeing

201
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,799
what did well in certain situations um

202
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,680
with a hydra i could do a lot of tests

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,520
about removing certain nutrients and

204
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,360
seeing which plants drink more um

205
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,560
which plants take up more nutrients

206
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
stuff like this

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,000
but now i'm actually going back to my

208
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,598
original

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
way of growing which i've always grown

210
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,240
which is organic

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,960
but without the bottle feed and making

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,478
more of my

213
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,878
own ferments and teas and

214
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,680
stuff like this which i do outdoors so

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,840
i'm bringing

216
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,560
my outdoor organic methods now indoors

217
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,119
so you've got some pretty insane photos

218
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,759
of

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
your strains not necessarily all of them

220
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,759
from your garden but

221
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,400
you know some really full-on photos just

222
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,360
towering colas things like that

223
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,958
do you feel like when that level of

224
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,120
quantity is being produced

225
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,038
from a single plant it is at the

226
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,599
detriment of other qualities like you

227
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,519
know

228
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,120
quality yes i've noticed in the past

229
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,320
with a lot of strains that are big

230
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,360
yielding

231
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,160
they tend to lack quality but obviously

232
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,959
through selection and

233
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,079
the gene pools that we are using now you

234
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,239
can achieve both

235
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:02,160
yeah um but saying that

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,000
my the plans that i prefer the most

237
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:10,000
are on the more medium side of yield

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,519
but the new that the jungle juice

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,759
which uh i'm smoking today that has both

240
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,440
the quality and the yield the yields are

241
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,958
like outstanding

242
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
and people just keep picking this over

243
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:26,639
everything at the moment

244
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,639
so um yeah you can get both definitely

245
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,919
so if we just go back now for a moment

246
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,639
how was it that you decided to get into

247
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,599
breeding

248
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,799
was it like a eureka moment on your own

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,480
was it

250
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,919
you thought you could improve on what

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,920
was already there or was it just a bit

252
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,240
of an accident

253
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,039
the first one was a bit of an accident

254
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,919
it was

255
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,838
um a blueberry that hermed and

256
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,439
pollinated some of the

257
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
stuff the stuff in the room that me and

258
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,200
a friend were growing which at the time

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,278
was

260
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:03,200
a white widow um a hemp star

261
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:06,639
bubble gum we had a skunk number one

262
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,240
i missed a nice hash plant we were

263
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,439
growing a lot of hash plant at the time

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,159
as well

265
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
and a lot of casey brains things so a

266
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,439
few things got pollinated by the

267
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,759
blueberry

268
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,959
and i started germinating the seeds and

269
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,399
that's when i realized like we're not

270
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,278
getting any males

271
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,799
they're all feminized seeds that's when

272
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,000
i realized that we've made like

273
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,240
feminized seeds um

274
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,839
it was probably a few years later from

275
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,320
that point

276
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,240
that i was growing a lot of like dutch

277
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,839
seed companies out

278
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,278
and just found them being quite lacking

279
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,519
and that's when i thought right i think

280
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,439
i can actually make something a little

281
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,480
bit better than this

282
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,360
so i already had a plant that we call

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,879
nap which was like a hindu kush type

284
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,159
plant

285
00:10:52,879 --> 00:11:01,519
which was like super resinous

286
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:04,319
um like knockout sleepy type of high

287
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,799
and but the the flavor was maybe lacking

288
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,480
it had this slight like aniseed

289
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,559
hashy type taste and

290
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,240
so i thought i can improve on that and i

291
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,679
crossed the

292
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,240
santa maria hayes mail onto that

293
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,719
and this is what later on went to makes

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,799
the

295
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,440
mantis which is one of my like first

296
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,240
main breeding project where i had i had

297
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,240
a goal at the end

298
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,278
yeah and so i mean if we look at the

299
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,160
mantis for a quick moment

300
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,958
online the genetics listed is knapp

301
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,159
cross to

302
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,958
santa maria hayes was it a santa maria

303
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:48,639
hayes hybrid or just santa maria

304
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:51,679
no santa maria hayes i found it in some

305
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
haze uh flowers that i was smoking in

306
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,159
holland

307
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,879
and i found like five seeds in it

308
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,278
so i spoke to the guy in the coffee shop

309
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,679
and

310
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,399
he told me that he had a santa maria

311
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,199
male

312
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
that probably pollinated it so i took

313
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,639
those seeds home

314
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,799
thinking uh they might be feminized

315
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,879
we'll see if he's telling the truth

316
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,799
and i got two females and

317
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,799
three males and did the selection from

318
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,759
them

319
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,759
so mantis went on to do a few different

320
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,879
projects the one i'm interested in

321
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,759
is the cali schnapple kush now kelly

322
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,838
schnapple

323
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,519
clone from sonic there's also another

324
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,720
one in the states from dynasty just so

325
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,560
everyone knows not talking about that

326
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,360
one talking about the one from sonic

327
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,359
what is it about the mantis og hybrid

328
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
you know you found the one you're after

329
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,320
what was it about that that you were

330
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,719
thinking this is going to pair really

331
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,278
well with the cali schnapple

332
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,800
um it was mainly to uh i wanted to add a

333
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,759
little bit more

334
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:56,799
of that oh gee sort of flavor into the

335
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,838
curry snapple because the cabbage napple

336
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,199
has an amazing flavor but i just wanted

337
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,160
to

338
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,680
bring something more to it so that's

339
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,799
adding that mail was

340
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,759
the idea of that um but the cali snapple

341
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,799
on its own is an

342
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,600
amazing plant like super tropical sort

343
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,799
of

344
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,040
flavors that come off it amazing

345
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,838
and the yield's huge yeah and the

346
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,000
biggest plants i've grown

347
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
full on so just looking back at a

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
comment you made before about

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,720
getting those seeds from amsterdam

350
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,200
almost some parallels with the uh

351
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,519
mr soul story from brothers grimm what

352
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,079
did the females turn out like from that

353
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,759
because you know you used the mantis

354
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,759
males or females was it the males

355
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,560
yeah i used a male from them onto the

356
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,319
female nap here

357
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,479
so the the females that came from those

358
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,360
seeds uh

359
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,079
one of them was like a haze but with a

360
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,919
little bit more structure to it

361
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:03,120
um and the other one had this sort of

362
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,759
lime terp which is what you get in the

363
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,759
mantis

364
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,159
and so would you ever consider like

365
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,838
f2ing and

366
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,000
just further line breeding it or is it

367
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,279
just more of like a breeding i have done

368
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
the month is now i've taken i'm made the

369
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:23,120
f2 line which i did release

370
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,198
um who cannabis did a nice article

371
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
on them there's a little bit of

372
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,439
variation but

373
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
so so much less variation than i would

374
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,240
expect you

375
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:38,639
and then i took it to f3

376
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,839
i've made two batches of f3

377
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,440
and released one of them and then

378
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,279
this year i'm going to take you to f4

379
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
what do you expect out of the f4s i mean

380
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,000
given the f2s didn't show all that much

381
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,320
variation as one might expect you'd

382
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,360
similarly think the f4s would be pretty

383
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,480
limited in their variation as well right

384
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,839
yeah and i'm going to do the f4s from a

385
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,639
much larger population as well um

386
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
so i'm going to probably use like five

387
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,799
females or maybe two

388
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,879
two or three males from a selection of

389
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,599
maybe 50 or 100

390
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,559
and then that will be the the f4 that

391
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
i'll finally release again

392
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,319
and so that's interesting i've been

393
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
talking to a few people about this idea

394
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
would you then want to release those

395
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,320
seeds as labeled like

396
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,519
just just a mixture from all of them and

397
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,959
that's just you know it all just comes

398
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,679
from one batch or would you want to

399
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,278
isolate

400
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,519
individual females and be like you're

401
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,799
buying a packet from this female

402
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,039
because a few breeders have done that

403
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,679
before like dungeon vault he does that

404
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,039
with a few different phenotypes of a few

405
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,159
different strains but

406
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,838
i think it'd be interesting if more

407
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,559
people got on board or do you just think

408
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,160
for

409
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,359
in terms of like not bottlenecking

410
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,919
things you just want to mix it all

411
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,240
together and release it like that

412
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,360
yeah for that reason so it doesn't

413
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,399
bottleneck to the

414
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
the genetics um but i would definitely

415
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,360
use

416
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,399
the five females i would use would all

417
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,839
be five females

418
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,240
that all resemble each other still

419
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,000
i wouldn't want it to be too varied the

420
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,198
main thing i go for with the

421
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,480
with the mantis is that the the lime the

422
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,000
lime

423
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,680
like opal fruits do you know opal fruits

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,679
no no okay we had like opal fruits i

425
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,479
think they're called starbursts now

426
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,519
but um you get you get the green ones

427
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,360
and

428
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,560
it just just reminds me of having them

429
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,560
as a kid

430
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,799
so that's the main thing i go for with

431
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,799
the mantis

432
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,439
and so if we look at some of the other

433
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,639
lines you've lime breaded the

434
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,279
i'm going to say this wrong is it the

435
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,079
pure sang or the purse

436
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,958
okay the person yeah that that's that

437
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,000
was a

438
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:53,679
sonic thing um he selected

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,278
that from seeds from barney's

440
00:16:53,679 --> 00:17:00,638
um coffee shop and he got them from

441
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,958
from derry and i remember seeing it in

442
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,198
the

443
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,119
canner bible jason king's canon bible

444
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,639
and he mentions it in there the person

445
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,678
hayes

446
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,038
but i think sonic was the only guy who

447
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,240
who like she kept those seeds going

448
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:20,240
and bred that line so it's

449
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:25,120
he he line bred it i just took it to f4

450
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:28,720
um later on um so it's mainly his work

451
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,839
um but yeah he he uses a purse sang in a

452
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,400
lot of his crosses

453
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:38,240
and i've used that breeding male as well

454
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,480
and yeah it's a it's a great male and

455
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,558
great plant to use as a super like

456
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,960
like i won't want to compare it to

457
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,200
amnesia but it has that similar terp to

458
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
amnesia but much more sativa and much

459
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
more fruity almost like bubble gum

460
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,240
fruity

461
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
like an old super silver haze or

462
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,919
something

463
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,119
it's interesting i was gonna ask what do

464
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
you like about it but you just kind of

465
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,199
banged it out

466
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,200
so something that's been kind of popped

467
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,400
up in a few of the answers is

468
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,720
you know this underlying theme of

469
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
dutch genetics and you know things

470
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,079
coming from holland

471
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
how do you feel holland influenced the

472
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,558
landscape of

473
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,480
the uk breeding scene because i think

474
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,798
like for me personally from the outside

475
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,038
point of view it seemed like for a while

476
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,279
when holland first started to stagnate

477
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,960
and say the early 2000s

478
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,319
kind of felt like that rippled a bit to

479
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,880
the uk

480
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,960
how do you feel about that yeah and i

481
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,480
think this is when you've seen

482
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,759
a influx of more people actually

483
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,200
selecting things and keeping more clones

484
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,879
and actually making their own seeds

485
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,919
around this sort of time

486
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,520
um yeah definitely

487
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:54,160
like uh the one main strain that i think

488
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,960
played a big role in the uk is the uk

489
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,080
cheese

490
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,120
which also came from dutch seeds

491
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,918
you know skunk number one

492
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,719
yeah i mean it's almost like synonymous

493
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,960
in the uk

494
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,480
like good weed is just called skunk in

495
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,240
many places i remember at least when i

496
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,319
was there in 2010

497
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,839
like hydro was called skunk like you

498
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,399
know like like good indoor

499
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,519
quality high quality weed was skunk and

500
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,880
the other stuff was just

501
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,200
import do you feel like there were some

502
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,160
kind of unsung heroes in terms of

503
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,319
strains

504
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
that did help build the scene like i've

505
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,200
only recently become aware of it through

506
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,400
a few friends um

507
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,759
shout out to vic firth but uh psychosis

508
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,000
you know that's from like the same the

509
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,960
exodus crew those same guys who did the

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,400
cheese

511
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,400
are there any other ones that you know

512
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,759
of that you feel like did really help

513
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
build the scene but maybe didn't get

514
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,480
that spotlight because

515
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,480
cheese was like the poster child

516
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,240
yeah um there's a couple of strains that

517
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,359
there was about there was one that we

518
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
kept coming across

519
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,798
uh called i just it was just called i

520
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,759
it was i'm almost along those same sort

521
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,240
of like fruity skunk lines

522
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,319
that like typical dutch skunk but on

523
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,519
that fruity side

524
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:12,480
um and

525
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,720
yeah that was one that stood out for me

526
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,200
um

527
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,720
yeah definitely it was it was later on

528
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
that like the nap

529
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
that clone that i passed around to quite

530
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,280
a few people

531
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,280
um and yeah i suppose

532
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,839
psychosis was always a nice standout

533
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,519
strain it's very similar into in terms

534
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,678
of with cheese

535
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,960
like if you put them both in there in

536
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,120
the same jar

537
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,440
i think you'd struggle to pick them out

538
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,239
yeah it all comes down to who grows it

539
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,519
and

540
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,359
yeah i think that plays a big role

541
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,038
and so how do you feel about the way

542
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,678
things are now in the uk

543
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,119
where you know at least for the masses

544
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,080
cali is king

545
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,519
and seems like you know those import

546
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,599
packs are like

547
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,359
the be all end-all do you think this is

548
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,119
a healthy culture or it's maybe

549
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,319
detracting from what's

550
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:07,599
a really blooming scene at the moment

551
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:10,158
yeah um i

552
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,038
i yeah the whole the the cali packs and

553
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,120
stuff like this

554
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,480
it's all gone a bit crazy the whole the

555
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,279
prices and stuff like that

556
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,240
i've heard of these things go for is

557
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,440
just

558
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,000
unbelievable um

559
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,798
i've not tried a lot of these sort of

560
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,558
like

561
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,960
new cali elites yeah

562
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,240
but from what i hear from a lot of my

563
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,038
friends

564
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
again it all depends on who's grown it

565
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:37,759
and

566
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,960
i think a lot of these things are coming

567
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,038
over to the uk

568
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
are probably stuff that they can't sell

569
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,079
in a lot of places

570
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,000
that probably would fail a lot of tasks

571
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,558
it's certainly interesting the idea if

572
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
we don't go to clones

573
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,759
what do you feel about clones it seems

574
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,279
like you know with

575
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,919
the uh advent of clone shippers existing

576
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,440
the number of clones in different

577
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,960
countries particularly the uk has just

578
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,279
gone through the roof

579
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,038
i've seen people in the uk with clones

580
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,440
that i would almost swear

581
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,119
would still be incredibly hard to get in

582
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,159
in the usa you know like they seem so

583
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,678
tightly held

584
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,760
do you think that a lot of the stuff

585
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,159
that is being flaunted around

586
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,200
is real i almost get the impression that

587
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,440
maybe

588
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,240
people are just getting s ones or you

589
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,759
know because like

590
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,120
for example if you say i've got sour

591
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,558
diesel you're probably familiar with the

592
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,038
situation it's like

593
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,319
is it the real sour diesel and so you

594
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,679
know what i mean do you feel like a lot

595
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,119
of the stuff that's coming in is the

596
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,519
real deal or maybe people

597
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,279
are just a bit optimistic or maybe

598
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,599
getting swindled or you know somewhere

599
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,440
in the middle

600
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,879
yeah i think there's a lot of clones of

601
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,200
each thing and

602
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,440
people will find a bag seed and whatever

603
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,159
they find in that's what they'll name it

604
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,720
so yeah i imagine that a lot of these

605
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,320
clones aren't the original ones

606
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,839
um yeah i'd agree i'd agree

607
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,200
to say that yeah so how do you go about

608
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,319
sourcing your clones if there's

609
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,840
something kind of

610
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:10,798
in the us and maybe you're not really

611
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,240
sorry and um and maybe you know without

612
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,440
obviously talking about getting it to

613
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,679
spain like

614
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,720
do you find it's hard to source things

615
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,038
or does

616
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,679
spain got plenty to offer where's that

617
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,319
stand for you as a breeder

618
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,919
yeah i i tend to work with a lot more

619
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,319
seeds to be honest now

620
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,280
i used to work more with clones and

621
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,798
elite clones like the sfv the bubba

622
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,798
i've just got the bubba back from a

623
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,240
friend um

624
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,839
so i'll definitely be working with that

625
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,359
more but the rest of the us elite things

626
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,879
um i'm not too bothered about getting as

627
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,918
the original clone

628
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,480
like i've got crosses where i know the

629
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,640
originals have been used

630
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,919
people like from colorado and people

631
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,320
like that

632
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,000
um so yeah i i prefer to do that i think

633
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,359
a lot of the problems come from sharing

634
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,880
clones you see

635
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,519
and with america having a big problem

636
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,679
with like russet mites

637
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,359
pm um i'd rather not take in clones from

638
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,880
places like that

639
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,479
do you feel like you can almost stand

640
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,720
behind your work more

641
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,679
when you're using both mother and father

642
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,679
that you've found from seed

643
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,840
yes because then it is fully your

644
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,080
selection on both sides

645
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:30,000
um i think we can select our own elites

646
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,240
i think most people can even select

647
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,919
elites from packets of seeds mine

648
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,440
so i think a lot of it is hype

649
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,960
and i think it i i could select a plant

650
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
and give it to a certain person if they

651
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,038
hyped it the way they typed over strains

652
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:50,158
it would become just as popular um

653
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,599
so yeah i think that plays a big role i

654
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,640
find a lot of these elites that

655
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,558
have spoken to friends they say that

656
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,480
some and not even that stand out

657
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:02,240
compared to other stuff that

658
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:06,240
they've selected or tried for me so

659
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,359
um yeah interesting you bring that up

660
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,880
because

661
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,359
i've kind of been having thoughts like

662
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,120
that myself i pop a lot of seeds pretty

663
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,959
regularly and i guess i just

664
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,719
commonly think to myself like geez i'm

665
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,480
finding a lot of keepers

666
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,159
and then like i look at the numbers and

667
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
it seems pretty proportional

668
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,520
but um yeah that's always made me think

669
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,520
like

670
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,720
is the barlow or what so here's the

671
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,720
question

672
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,159
how often is it you come across a plant

673
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,278
you pop from a seed

674
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,120
and you're thinking to yourself wow this

675
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,359
this is really like you know a notch

676
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,879
above what i would normally consider a

677
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,798
good plant this is like

678
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,159
you know like definitely clone only

679
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,679
possibly one of the best plants i've

680
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,760
ever grown you know how often does that

681
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,880
happen

682
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,000
quite regular to be honest um especially

683
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,840
if you're growing things

684
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,839
from if the person sent you a packet

685
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,038
of something like i've recently grew up

686
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,720
the the bodhi

687
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,919
uh soulmate um he sent me a few packets

688
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,839
of different things

689
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,240
and like there was a little bit of

690
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,000
variation but there's two females from

691
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,359
the song me

692
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,278
that could easily both be elite strings

693
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,479
but the smells of them the growth on

694
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,119
them is amazing

695
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,079
i'm yet to try them both but i know

696
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,199
that's going to come through on the

697
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,639
flavor

698
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,600
so yeah um both of them

699
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,038
both standout plants and i see this a

700
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,798
lot i've just grown out some stuff from

701
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,558
colorado

702
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,319
amazing plants again so this is what i

703
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,839
i work towards this is what i want

704
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,639
everybody else to have they grow a

705
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,720
packet of my

706
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,559
of my seeds and they find

707
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,159
out with a 10-pack five plants that

708
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,200
they're gonna struggle to

709
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,880
pick a keeper from yeah it's always a

710
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,640
good problem to have when you've got to

711
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,840
uh pick your keeper isn't it too many to

712
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,320
choose from

713
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,879
yes yeah this is what everybody should

714
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,278
be getting from their seats

715
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,000
yeah we have such a gene pool to choose

716
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,558
from

717
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,919
nowadays it's not like it was like 10

718
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,119
years ago

719
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,400
um so everything that people

720
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,119
are breeding um people should be able to

721
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,159
find

722
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,599
uh keepers in every packet especially if

723
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,039
people are putting the work in as well i

724
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,398
see a lot of just people

725
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,798
releasing a lot of f1s but i would like

726
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,879
to go

727
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,319
down that line myself more just because

728
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,120
i can get through

729
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,480
more strains in a shorter amount of time

730
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,239
and i think that's the

731
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,480
the line i'm going to be going more

732
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,480
towards because

733
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
i like popping seeds all the time making

734
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,038
new things all the time

735
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,919
so yeah definitely go along those lines

736
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,519
so interestingly mandarin is one of the

737
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,520
ones i knew from you

738
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,519
before i'd ever done any serious kind of

739
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,398
research you know i always do some

740
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,759
good research before every interview so

741
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,359
after i kind of looked into it a little

742
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,200
more seriously

743
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,639
quickly noticed one half of its age in

744
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,919
orange

745
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,759
and the thing which kind of jumped to

746
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,200
minded that is is

747
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,720
you probably haven't heard it but we

748
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,120
recently did an interview with james

749
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,240
bean

750
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,158
and he actually posed the

751
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,558
you know the proposition that tangi is

752
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,960
possibly just an agent orange offspring

753
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,200
or

754
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,200
s1 or maybe just a cut of it saying that

755
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
he had done some filos testing and that

756
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,960
was what it indicated

757
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,240
surely you've grown tangy it's big all

758
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,240
around the world did you see any

759
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,000
similarities between the age and orange

760
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,480
you use for mandarina

761
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,839
and tangies would you feel like there's

762
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,640
maybe any similarities between them

763
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,319
there are some similarities um i always

764
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,600
said that tanji was a

765
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,480
nyc diesel uh that's what i always

766
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,519
thought it was

767
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,759
because they have a nyc diesel

768
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,038
clone that i found found out recently

769
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,319
that goes around spain

770
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,240
and they call this the mandarina cut and

771
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,079
when i found that i was like that that's

772
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,120
that's that's like tangy

773
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:59,359
so that just reinforced the force i sort

774
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,719
of already had that tangi was a

775
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:06,000
nyc diesel but it could easily be a

776
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,440
agent orange because i find these same

777
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,079
when i've crossed the mandarina with

778
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,480
other things like the sour diesel

779
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:17,599
i get those same turps coming out like

780
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:22,079
the nyc diesel with tangy type things

781
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:26,719
whereas mandarina is a lot more sweeter

782
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:28,240
fizzy sherbet type orange smells

783
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,960
well what's interesting to me is like

784
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,200
you made mandarina a few years ago now

785
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,159
however as far as i can tell from the

786
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,558
timeline

787
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,240
you made it just kind of before right

788
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,678
when the whole hype around the citrus

789
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,798
terpene was just taking off and

790
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,360
obviously

791
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,720
tangy was a big proponent of that but

792
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,000
did you have any idea that was going to

793
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
come about like did you

794
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,159
have a sense that this kind of you know

795
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,240
orangey mandarin

796
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,159
terpene profile was about to just take

797
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,720
the scene by storm or

798
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,520
was it a bit of a fluke like seems like

799
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,480
it came out at a perfect time

800
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,599
yeah like we really enjoyed the agent

801
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,319
orange

802
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,759
from subcool that that was just a

803
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,278
standout plant

804
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,759
we passed that clone around so many

805
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:16,000
people um

806
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,519
so working with that was just

807
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,679
we were gonna do it anyway because it

808
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,599
was such a nice plant

809
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,038
um i thought the orange thing was

810
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,319
fizzling out to be honest

811
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,398
because so many people were getting

812
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,359
tired of that orange turp

813
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,599
but i think the new generation and how

814
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:35,599
things come around in circles

815
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:37,199
like with fashion and everything else um

816
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,798
things make a comeback and i think that

817
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,038
it was perfect timing

818
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:44,480
that they saw yeah that came back as i

819
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,480
was working the mandarina line

820
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:49,519
and what was it about the you know the

821
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,320
male you used in that cross

822
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,398
that was right the uk pineapples some

823
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,480
shiva in there and even dynamite

824
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,000
what was it about that which you thought

825
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,640
just paired well with it because

826
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,919
essentially it seems like it's imparted

827
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,559
how would you put it

828
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,278
kind of mellowed a bit of the sugariness

829
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,519
at least i'm

830
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,720
the asian orange i'm familiar with like

831
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,480
a sweet orange

832
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,399
so like mandarina you know it's added

833
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,599
like a bit of sourness taking a bit of

834
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:14,719
sugariness

835
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,519
what do you think the male brought to

836
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,120
the table yeah the

837
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,240
the pine of my shiva mail um

838
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,359
i mainly was putting that onto the

839
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,278
cheese

840
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,759
and the pineapples to do like almost

841
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:32,319
like a pineapple back cross

842
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,558
and also to cross it with the cheese

843
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:38,240
because of that skunkiness

844
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:42,158
um at the time i had a pot of gold

845
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,319
there was also a nice like sweet skunky

846
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,399
apple sort of terp going on with that

847
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,319
one i thought i crossed that without so

848
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,918
i was going for a skunky type thing this

849
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,319
is what i was working

850
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,159
but then i had the agent orange i had

851
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,879
the crowberry

852
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,880
i had the bubba kush and also the jack's

853
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,679
cleaner clone from subcool

854
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,760
so at the time i thought okay well i'll

855
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,000
pollinate them at the same time

856
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,200
so they were all just real experimental

857
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,519
whereas

858
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,319
that's why it sort of took a back burner

859
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,319
for a while

860
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,079
but then after a few people trying it

861
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,158
and saying it was really nice

862
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,599
i thought okay i'll definitely work that

863
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,320
line in the future

864
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,839
and when i came to spain that's when i

865
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,158
started to finish the line

866
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:27,119
so it was quite a few years it was a big

867
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,960
gap from start to finish

868
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,639
yeah well are there any other lines like

869
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,240
that which you've been working over you

870
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,440
know many years

871
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,440
uh the jungle kush

872
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,360
that's something that i've done so the

873
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,480
original cross was

874
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:46,079
sfv the clone

875
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,919
the bubba kush clone and the hawaiian

876
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,199
the hawaiian was added to add like a

877
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,759
little bit more vigor

878
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,600
to to those to those strains um

879
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,000
and then from those seeds i work that

880
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,319
line

881
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,319
crossing them together and doing a

882
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,759
little bit of selection

883
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,558
and then that's what i release as the

884
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:10,558
actual jungle push then later on

885
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:14,000
so the mantis the mandarina

886
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:16,798
and the jungle kush are the

887
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,839
three lines that i've worked really

888
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,278
everything else is

889
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,879
mainly f1 after that okay and was the

890
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,200
first release of the jungle kush

891
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,840
labelled like f2 f3 or

892
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
did you just call it jungle kush just

893
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,959
jungle kush

894
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
yeah same with the mandarina even though

895
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,558
i worked the line in that

896
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,399
it's because it's never sort of released

897
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,798
so the original ones

898
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,879
just go between maybe a few friends that

899
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,038
are testing it and stuff like that

900
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,278
and then what i actually release will be

901
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,759
the worst line and that is

902
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,038
what i release because that's as close

903
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,240
to the mother that i

904
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,599
most people have tried as well would you

905
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,679
consider

906
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,079
kind of adding those generations onto

907
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,240
future packets just in the fact that

908
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,798
these days it seems almost standard that

909
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,038
the more generations a line has

910
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,079
put into it you know you can almost

911
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:07,759
charge a bit more

912
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,838
for each generation because you know you

913
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,358
have put work in for each generation

914
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,199
or would you still just always want to

915
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,159
keep it you know just simply

916
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,279
jungle push for example no i definitely

917
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,480
want to put like i

918
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,480
haven't got a catalog or anything like

919
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,719
that at the moment

920
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,639
so i'd like to put catalog together and

921
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,039
maybe in there put a little bit more

922
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,760
of the history and the actual breeding

923
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,279
work of each string

924
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,760
i think that would be a good option just

925
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,000
because if nothing else

926
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,119
potentially other breeders you know like

927
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,838
they're always looking

928
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,480
for you know potentially more work

929
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:42,719
stocks

930
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,918
more stable more predictable generally

931
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,279
and also

932
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,199
you know hopefully you haven't wasted

933
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,879
your time working a line that was a dud

934
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,319
so you know kind of a good indication if

935
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,078
you've bothered to work it's probably

936
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,639
pretty good

937
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,839
yeah no definitely and you you like the

938
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,800
mandarina is so

939
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,239
stable for for that for that smell that

940
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,079
it has on it

941
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,159
anything that you cross it with i mean

942
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,400
so many people have uh i've even seen

943
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,399
some small little breeders that are on

944
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,358
my instagram and that they've used

945
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,559
the mail of it i reversed it made a few

946
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:16,319
lines for

947
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:19,519
karma and stuff like that so um

948
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,559
and it's it's a very dominant trait now

949
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,559
because of how it's been bred

950
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,679
so you've mentioned a few uk breeders

951
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,519
and you know i've mentioned one or two

952
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,679
why do you think it is that a lot of the

953
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,920
uk breeders don't get as much notoriety

954
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,879
as some of the us breeders do you think

955
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,559
it's

956
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,400
the fact that just the culture is a bit

957
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,838
different or do you think there's

958
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,960
not as many breeders per capita type

959
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,480
thing in the uk

960
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,480
what do you think the situation is

961
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,679
i think it definitely comes down to

962
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,078
location and

963
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,679
the whole scene the american scene is

964
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,240
totally different

965
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:59,919
to the uk scene yeah

966
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,239
the outdoor scene that they have there

967
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,880
as well yeah i think

968
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,519
the selections that they've been able to

969
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,358
do

970
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,119
even since the 60s and stuff like this

971
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:12,159
in america

972
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,960
they have a a good genetic pool of

973
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,078
plants

974
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,400
yeah and so did people

975
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,720
not really keep seeds from those early

976
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,400
import hash because it seems like

977
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,959
that's kind of the most valuable stuff

978
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,160
going around at the moment

979
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,119
no yeah i think like even

980
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,559
the old like hippie types that i knew

981
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,640
and stuff like that

982
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,078
like they never even kept hash even

983
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,960
though they brought back all sorts of

984
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,240
different things from

985
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,400
india and places it's because

986
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,519
we haven't got that outdoor scenery

987
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,559
whereas people

988
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,239
when they came back from their travels

989
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,440
back to america those seeds could be

990
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,598
planted straight in the ground and

991
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,679
people could grow them out

992
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,200
yeah that's interesting and so do you

993
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,838
think overall

994
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,519
the ability to have an outdoor season in

995
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,239
general just really benefits the

996
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,358
community

997
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,319
like the scene so to speak yes yes

998
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,358
definitely

999
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,240
definitely i even see it here in spain

1000
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,239
and

1001
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,759
visiting like older growers and stuff

1002
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:15,039
like that they have some

1003
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,359
strains that they've kept for years and

1004
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,159
they're things that i've never like even

1005
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:19,679
smelt before

1006
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,279
some of the smiles that come from these

1007
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,358
old sativas

1008
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,720
and stuff that they've kept uh yeah very

1009
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,000
impressive

1010
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:31,118
um i grew a few out last year

1011
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,159
and um yeah some of the

1012
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,760
terps he had one that was an afghan

1013
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,239
cross

1014
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,720
and it smelled like straight up

1015
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:44,078
chocolate from dna genetics

1016
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,679
like straight up chocolate so that was

1017
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,200
quite impressive

1018
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:51,039
um but yeah so definitely the outdoor

1019
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,639
scene definitely uh

1020
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,639
improves those genetics i think

1021
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,879
and so you just touched on it you're now

1022
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,719
in spain what's the spanish seem like

1023
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,280
you know you're our first person from

1024
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,159
the

1025
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,320
spanish region who's given able to give

1026
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,799
us the rundown which is obviously

1027
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,720
in my opinion the kind of hot place to

1028
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,160
be in the eu right now would you agree

1029
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:19,118
and what's it like from your perspective

1030
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,759
um yeah i think how it's portrayed on

1031
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,119
the

1032
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,200
internet and is is totally different to

1033
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,039
how it is in reality

1034
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:31,039
um in catalonia now

1035
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,239
um some of the clubs are starting to be

1036
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,199
recognized and

1037
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,879
they're going down that line of sort of

1038
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,799
legality

1039
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,720
but how they're going to actually

1040
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:46,320
regulate it and stuff like that i

1041
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:49,039
i really don't know um the rest of spain

1042
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,920
no if you you can't take any any

1043
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:55,039
cannabis on your personal self outside

1044
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,599
um if you're in your own house doing it

1045
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,639
you're

1046
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,039
you you are permitted to do that growing

1047
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,199
it

1048
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:05,920
is is a big gray area really so

1049
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,439
um but barcelona sense is is the place

1050
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,440
where

1051
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,639
it is changing and going towards the

1052
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,838
right way

1053
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,279
where you have a lot of clubs now um

1054
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,279
they have the span of this every year

1055
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,480
which is a really big event

1056
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,599
um so yeah it's going in the right

1057
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,358
direction

1058
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,320
this is a much more relaxed than the uk

1059
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,880
how the general public view it here as

1060
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,920
well

1061
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,680
is is a lot more relaxed and so how do

1062
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,159
you feel about spanish you know

1063
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,559
a lot of people in the states uh have

1064
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,799
mixed feelings about cops for a variety

1065
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,799
of reasons do you think like

1066
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,839
the spanish cup's pretty good you know

1067
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,640
it's not

1068
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,519
not really any whispers of corruption or

1069
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,838
any people who

1070
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:55,199
are you know causing any mishaps

1071
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:56,239
so far i i've seen none of that and it

1072
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,919
seems to be

1073
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,559
like the the best flower or the best

1074
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,800
extract

1075
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:08,078
does win um a group of friends of mine

1076
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,440
and a deborah tree fabulous

1077
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,000
which like a extract company they

1078
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,920
entered the sour mandarina extract and

1079
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,920
they got second place

1080
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,639
so um there's there's definitely no

1081
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,358
uh it can't be sort of bought how they

1082
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,559
judge it

1083
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:30,480
as well is quite fair in the way

1084
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:33,039
they do it um i'd like to see the actual

1085
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,760
the actual voting to show that

1086
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,199
afterwards

1087
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,880
that would be interesting i like how

1088
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,960
they do that on

1089
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,920
the ic mag cup i think that's a very

1090
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,760
sort of

1091
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,760
uh transparent good one

1092
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,719
nice and so how do you

1093
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
interact with all the other breeders in

1094
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,199
spain you know there's a few notable

1095
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,679
ones like

1096
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,519
charlie garcia and the guys from canada

1097
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,239
biogen are the first ones to jump to

1098
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,559
mind

1099
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,159
do you have a lot of interaction with

1100
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,039
those guys or is it everyone's just kind

1101
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:06,078
of doing their own thing at the moment

1102
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,838
yeah i don't tend to sort of uh

1103
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,240
get into the whole scene out here too

1104
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,719
much i'm quite far from barcelona

1105
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,000
and i'm like out in the sticks in the

1106
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,519
country

1107
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,679
um so yeah i i i'm not

1108
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,679
sort of i don't get involved in that

1109
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,598
side of things too much out here

1110
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,960
and when i go to spannabis um

1111
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,880
i meet up with some of the breeders

1112
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,519
there and stuff like that and

1113
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,079
yeah it's a good event for that even

1114
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,400
though

1115
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,200
they have a cup and stuff it's more

1116
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,680
about

1117
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,358
going seeing old friends new people

1118
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,199
seeing what people have

1119
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,039
seen how the the blood has changed over

1120
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,719
the last few years is get just getting

1121
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,358
better and better and better so

1122
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,559
i can only see it in the next two three

1123
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,598
years

1124
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:54,880
um it's going to be some amazing stuff

1125
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,318
available in all of these places and so

1126
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,760
what's the coolest thing you've ever

1127
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:02,800
seen at the cup in terms of budweis

1128
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,680
um there's a few places that have some

1129
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
nice stuff

1130
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,078
um right but the most like place that

1131
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,039
i'll actually like to chill out

1132
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,400
is like there's a place called um our

1133
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,759
backyard

1134
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,000
um that has a nice vibe about it and

1135
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,359
they

1136
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,159
always tend to have some nice stuff in

1137
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,920
there um one place i haven't checked out

1138
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,639
yet but they tend to stock a lot of my

1139
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,920
things and that is the plug

1140
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:31,039
um that's another place seems to have

1141
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,318
like a nice vibe about it um

1142
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,800
but yeah like i see i also see like a

1143
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,159
price

1144
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,640
increase as the i've

1145
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,239
i think the bud can be cheaper i think

1146
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,598
the prices need to be brought down

1147
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,358
definitely

1148
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,359
i think that will happen as things go

1149
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:52,400
more towards the legal side of things

1150
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:55,920
okay and do you think

1151
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:59,200
that the development of a scene

1152
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,760
is largely dependent on the number of

1153
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,838
people

1154
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,200
popping seeds because i've got this

1155
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,358
theory that

1156
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,318
if everyone stops popping seeds

1157
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,078
essentially

1158
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,599
everything will come to a standstill in

1159
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,800
terms of progression

1160
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,519
do you think that's the case 100

1161
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,599
yes because nothing new will be found

1162
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,079
everyone grows the same stuff

1163
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,599
everyone grows the same clone i see it

1164
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,839
happen in holland

1165
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,760
where everyone just wants to grow clones

1166
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:30,318
even in the uk

1167
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:33,839
but this the feminist seed market

1168
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:36,719
i think this is where most people

1169
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,880
in europe and the uk want to go down the

1170
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,919
lines of feminized seeds

1171
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,200
um but i think in the future i think

1172
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,838
even people are going to come away from

1173
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,318
that

1174
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,960
who who are more serious about it and be

1175
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,358
popping

1176
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,280
regular seeds and going through more

1177
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,519
regular seeds doing their own breeding

1178
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,200
doing their certain selection

1179
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,960
because i love to see other people's

1180
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,078
work because everybody selects something

1181
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,159
totally different

1182
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,519
i can give the same packages as seeds

1183
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,838
three different people

1184
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,159
and tell them to do some breeding work

1185
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,358
and what they end up with will be

1186
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:11,679
three totally different things totally

1187
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,480
and so we've mentioned a lot of breeders

1188
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:13,919
so far

1189
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,000
who are some of the ones who you really

1190
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,680
look up to or you you know you're really

1191
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
fond of the work they do

1192
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:23,279
[Music]

1193
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,960
okay um bodhi at the moment i'm

1194
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,319
very impressed with his work i've always

1195
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,000
been a like

1196
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,440
enjoyed talking to him and seeing his

1197
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,960
stuff online

1198
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,960
and breathe but he used to do a lot of

1199
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,119
good threads and when he used to do his

1200
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,159
trips just like south america and stuff

1201
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,318
like this yeah

1202
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,960
and uh nepal so yeah i i admire bodhi

1203
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,159
definitely

1204
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,318
he's a he's he's a good guy

1205
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,279
would there be anyone you'd want to do a

1206
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:53,119
collaboration with

1207
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,200
um i'd probably like to do

1208
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,318
a couple more things with sonic because

1209
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,919
um

1210
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,838
in the past me and him used to do a lot

1211
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,639
of work together in that

1212
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,519
and i like the lines that he's worked

1213
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,879
with

1214
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:09,599
so yeah maybe some of him i'd love to do

1215
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,519
one with bodhi that would be amazing

1216
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,559
yeah and so to kind of be devil's

1217
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,719
advocate

1218
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,239
what strain you know if the kind of the

1219
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,559
proposed idea is you're each going to

1220
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:20,879
bring

1221
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,960
one side of the strain to the table

1222
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,400
which strain and you can even choose

1223
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,240
which whether it's the male or the

1224
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,599
female what would you want to bring to

1225
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,239
the table

1226
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,119
uh well from both those people well no

1227
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,279
on your part

1228
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,960
if you were say to do a cross with bodhi

1229
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,319
don't worry about him for the moment

1230
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,318
what would you want to bring to the

1231
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,318
table on your half you can pick male or

1232
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,318
female but one of your strains

1233
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,838
you know what would you most kind of

1234
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,279
want to stand behind or what do you

1235
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,119
think would work the best with one of

1236
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,240
his lines

1237
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,079
i think the jungle kush or the mandarina

1238
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,479
just those two lines just because of how

1239
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,039
they breed and how strong they are

1240
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,519
bigger

1241
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,519
everything yeah turps yeah those two

1242
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,240
so i've had this interesting theory for

1243
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,879
a little bit now basically that

1244
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:09,118
a long time ago i used to get pretty bad

1245
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,800
anxiety with certain sativas generally

1246
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,318
you know like the more stronger ones

1247
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,200
pretty typical with what most people

1248
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:16,639
would describe and then as time went by

1249
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,039
i kind of didn't really get

1250
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,480
that anxiety anymore for a long time i

1251
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,880
was thinking to myself

1252
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,760
oh you know like i've just had like a

1253
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,680
tolerance

1254
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,119
build up to sativas in general and i'm

1255
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,159
now able to have these more racy ones

1256
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,440
because you know like i've worked my way

1257
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,358
up to a type thing

1258
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,760
but then thinking back on in general i

1259
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,759
was like you know what like

1260
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,480
back when i was getting anxiety from the

1261
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,960
sativas i had anxiety in general

1262
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,318
and nowadays when i can smoke them i

1263
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,318
don't actually get anxiety anymore i

1264
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:46,239
haven't in a very long time

1265
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,759
and so it makes me think do you think

1266
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,719
like a lot of that

1267
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
even with weed for example is down to

1268
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:52,639
where you're at

1269
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,639
personally because like a lot of people

1270
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,199
will say oh you know don't do a dmt trip

1271
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,679
if

1272
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,199
for example you really you're depressed

1273
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,118
or you're anxious because

1274
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,639
that type of stuff can be aggravated and

1275
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,519
come out do you think that even applies

1276
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,519
to weed as well

1277
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,399
i think it like we'll go to we'll say

1278
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,118
answer the dmt one first and say like

1279
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,960
look

1280
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,480
if you are feeling like anxious or

1281
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,880
depressed than that i want to say

1282
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,559
not to take it i think to do it with the

1283
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,119
right person

1284
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:25,199
yeah in the right space is definitely

1285
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,640
more to do with it than anything else

1286
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,480
obviously the mindset

1287
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,480
comes with it like the better mindset

1288
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,880
you're in but then

1289
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,318
you're going for an experience so

1290
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,838
sometimes it can help with different

1291
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,880
mindsets

1292
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:43,199
so with cannabis

1293
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,200
um i would say

1294
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,199
yeah like one of my friends he gets a

1295
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,399
bit anxious with the sativas and that

1296
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,358
and still does but as he's got

1297
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,358
older he's been able to handle it a

1298
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:58,480
little bit better definitely

1299
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,598
um i think does that answer your

1300
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,280
question i hope

1301
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,200
yeah no for sure it's interesting it's

1302
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,040
one i want to kind of think more about

1303
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,318
myself contemplate and see where we get

1304
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:07,759
to

1305
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,599
so a quick little question i wanted to

1306
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,520
ask where does the name banana man come

1307
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,640
from

1308
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,440
uh-huh that's a funny or not um

1309
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,440
right at the time i i was the only one

1310
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,960
just growing regular seeds all the time

1311
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,639
all my friends were growing feminized

1312
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,240
seeds and

1313
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,159
i was going today grows and i'm just

1314
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,519
picking up bananas everywhere

1315
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,960
so i'm thinking like i'll use a bit of a

1316
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:30,639
joke i'm like telling them i'm more of a

1317
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,960
banana farm i keep coming here just

1318
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,960
picking up bananas all day

1319
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,720
so when i went online i thought okay

1320
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,480
banana farmer and then

1321
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,239
and i thought no actually banana man i

1322
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,559
like the cartoon

1323
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,479
so yeah and that's how the name came

1324
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,319
about really

1325
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,318
that's awesome what stuff are you

1326
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,599
testing out at the moment

1327
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:54,480
uh like my friends just done like a big

1328
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,760
like grow over orange soda so i'm

1329
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,559
testing out some of them and i've just

1330
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,680
done a new

1331
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,000
jungle kush times jungle push again like

1332
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,318

1333
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,480

1334
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,558
different phoenix of that

1335
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,480

jungle dog venus

1339
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,599
which was a star dog across with the

1340
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,599
jungle kush

1341
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,359
again though limited i only released so

1342
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,200
many i think there's like a couple of

1343
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,119
packets still available at so

1344
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,759
other places but i probably won't make

1345
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,760
that one again

1346
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,480
how do you feel about the common hype

1347
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:32,800
strains you mentioned the gorilla glue

1348
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,079
a lot of people you know kind of hate on

1349
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,039
the hype strains but at the same time

1350
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,200
they love them

1351
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:42,639
where do you sit um

1352
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:46,399
no i i like a lot of them like there's

1353
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:49,679
the gt4 it it makes some real nice hash

1354
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,039
and yeah it's a good all-round strain

1355
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,960
like the ones that stood the test of

1356
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,960
time like like the og's

1357
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,119
and sours and stuff like that they're

1358
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,920
amazing the newer things like the

1359
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,160
cookies i do like the cookies

1360
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,039
i haven't tried like the gelato and a

1361
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,920
lot of these new

1362
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,440
ones from like and what else was there

1363
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,519
the sunset shirt

1364
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,200
things like this i'm yet to try them so

1365
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,920
and do you like to breed with the

1366
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:20,719
cookies i mean i know you have

1367
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,440
yes um i think it's good for breeding

1368
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,759
and

1369
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,679
from breeding with it i see so many

1370
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,079
fennels are so similar to like bubba

1371
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,719
when i breed with bubba as well

1372
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,599
definitely like those cherry pie type

1373
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,439
phenos are

1374
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,920
popping up as well so it's quite

1375
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,519
interesting when you breed a bit

1376
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,119
whatever the f1 durbin is

1377
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,960
if he's quite interested to find out

1378
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,480
what that actually is i don't think

1379
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,159
anybody actually knows to be honest

1380
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,719
that's my opinion on it

1381
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,719
yeah do you think it's the case that no

1382
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,759
one knows what the f1 derby is or that

1383
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:55,279
maybe it's just something completely

1384
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,960
i think they probably found it in a bag

1385
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,160
seed or something

1386
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,480
and they don't actually know what the

1387
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,679
parents is just like

1388
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,679
so many other things that have been

1389
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,399
found in backseat and people

1390
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,279
don't really know what the full parent

1391
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,720
is

1392
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,000
is yeah and so

1393
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,358
how do you feel about the idea of

1394
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,358
breeding with s-ones

1395
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,440
okay um i've just done a cross with an

1396
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,039
s1

1397
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:26,960
i'm testing it out now uh it's an

1398
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:30,400
s1 from a fruity purple og

1399
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,000
cross with og kb line so i've just

1400
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,240
crossed that with my jungle

1401
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,199
and i'm gonna see how that comes out but

1402
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,919
my s1 of my mandarina

1403
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,838
i wasn't happy enough to release them as

1404
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,960
a feminized line

1405
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:47,199
um i've grown other s ones out in the

1406
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,960
past of like some chem strains and stuff

1407
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:52,558
like this

1408
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,760
i've not really been impressed uh

1409
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,319
compared to the actual clone so

1410
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,079
yeah and so how do you feel about fem

1411
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:03,199
lines in general is it something we can

1412
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,559
expect from you in the future um yeah

1413
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,639
i'm definitely going to be making more

1414
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,920
phone lines in the future

1415
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:12,960
i made some mandarina phone lines

1416
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,680
and also some sour diesel phone lines

1417
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,960
last year and they've come out with some

1418
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:21,358
good results

1419
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:24,400
um the jungle juice and the orange soda

1420
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:27,838
was made with my jungle kush

1421
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,480
with the sour diesel reverse and also

1422
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,199
with the

1423
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,000
mandarina with the sour diesel reverse

1424
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,639
to make the orange

1425
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,199
soda but i did it the other way around

1426
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,558
as well

1427
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,838
i reversed the mandarina onto the sour

1428
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,680
diesel

1429
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,358
i also did the jungle push onto the

1430
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:44,960
mandarina and the mandarina onto the

1431
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,440
jungle kush

1432
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,400
and i've definitely seen that the

1433
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,440
dominant

1434
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,599
plan is the plant that you reverse

1435
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,440
like all the ones that i reverse with

1436
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,960
the sour diesel of that like slightly

1437
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,440
cyber diesel stretch and have more sour

1438
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,599
diesel

1439
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,159
taste with the mandarina whereas when

1440
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,039
you reverse the mandarina

1441
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,440
you get those more short sativa phenos

1442
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,119
and more mandarina taste coming out

1443
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,200
so it's been quite interesting insanely

1444
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,519
of way around with the jungle

1445
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,279
um i've seen some quite interesting

1446
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:18,318
things with like reversing and stuff

1447
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,359
like even

1448
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:24,000
reversing like i've had a male

1449
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,639
that produced pistols this was somebody

1450
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,639
else's clone

1451
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,599
and i use

1452
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:32,558
i've got seeds from it so i've floured

1453
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,079
it fully out

1454
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,920
collected the seeds from the mail

1455
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,000
and grew those seeds out and i'm getting

1456
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,519
50 50 male and female from them which i

1457
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,119
didn't expect

1458
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:48,559
so that's been quite interesting as well

1459
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,559
have you finished flaring them out

1460
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,159
yeah yeah yeah i got 50 50 male and

1461
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,599
female from the seeds

1462
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,519
but this was this was that was a couple

1463
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,880
years ago that one happened

1464
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,639
and were the females stable yeah

1465
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,160
the female was like a female from that

1466
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,000
liner

1467
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,279
so would you consider further using

1468
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,039
those seeds or they just weren't that

1469
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,400
good in general

1470
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:14,079
no they just went in the stash yeah

1471
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,559
nice so one thing i noticed is that

1472
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,960
you've used c99 in a few year strains

1473
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,599
and

1474
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,199
a lot of these strains came out before

1475
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,280
brothers grim came back

1476
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:25,679
would you consider re-releasing some of

1477
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,800
these strains with the new c99

1478
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:32,000
or what's your plans for that

1479
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,920
um no because they're back now

1480
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,358
um i probably won't work with that line

1481
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,119
anymore um

1482
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:39,039
at the time they weren't around the

1483
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,680
cindy 99 was an amazing plant

1484
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,558
that was a line worked by a friend of

1485
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:46,078
mine

1486
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,920
from greed bay and he worked the line

1487
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,440
for many years from the original bros

1488
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,720
grim and then

1489
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,720
i continued working that line to

1490
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:58,318
f4 um and i've just used

1491
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:00,399
a female that i've selected from those

1492
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,400
f4 seeds and

1493
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,160
pollinated that with the jungle kush and

1494
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,200
that's like i just named it jungle jane

1495
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:07,920
at the moment

1496
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:09,919
but i'm testing them out at the moment

1497
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,440
to see what they come out like

1498
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:17,039
but cindy 99 is a real special plant and

1499
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:21,440
uh that that pineappley

1500
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:23,279
uh fruity turp that something special so

1501
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,119
yeah i'll probably i won't work with

1502
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,720
that like now it's back

1503
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,640
it'd be interesting to see what they

1504
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,639
make

1505
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,838
so have you had a chance to try the new

1506
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,239
one and has your

1507
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:36,400
f4s you know has it varied over the

1508
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:39,679
generations compared to

1509
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,519
what the original is essentially

1510
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,719
no everything that you grow from the

1511
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,440
f-4s

1512
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,199
are just pure cindy's they're just all

1513
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,880
coming out so similar

1514
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,879
and there's not much variation and

1515
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,079
it was already almost like a stable line

1516
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,720
to work with anyway

1517
00:55:54,079 --> 00:56:00,240
so um it was i think it's quite easy

1518
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,239
my friend worked the line over the years

1519
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,078
just just on high

1520
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,519
and then i worked it on those pineapple

1521
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,880
things so yeah

1522
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:12,079
it's come out amazing so

1523
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,200
where do you rank different attributes

1524
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,599
in kind of your hierarchy of breeding so

1525
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,358
in your mind is it the case that you

1526
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,119
don't care if it's big or small yielding

1527
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,719
if it's just really good smoke like

1528
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,240
that's the goal or

1529
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,838
do you try to have you know a bit of a

1530
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,118
compromise between you know

1531
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:30,798
like commercial value or

1532
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,798
where where do you sit on that are you

1533
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,960
breeding entirely ahead stash what's the

1534
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:37,599
go

1535
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,079
no i i think like one of the main things

1536
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,359
for me

1537
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:45,200
is like the vigor of the plant and

1538
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:49,519
how well it can handle like

1539
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:50,960
mites is it resistant to powdery mildew

1540
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,639
these are some of the main things for me

1541
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,000
at the moment i think this is what

1542
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,000
most of the market needs to start

1543
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,880
looking towards because of how things

1544
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,599
are going

1545
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,480
so um yeah definitely that rent is quite

1546
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,920
high for me

1547
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,798
and flavor is is the main thing but the

1548
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,240
high

1549
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,239
that's that's down to different

1550
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:09,919
different lines that i work each line

1551
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:12,798
that i work has a different height about

1552
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,760
it and i think that comes with turps as

1553
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,960
well then

1554
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,640
i'm finding that certain turps like the

1555
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,838
orange things for instance

1556
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:24,480
the orangey things are on those lower

1557
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,880
thc sides the people that extract it

1558
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,920
get a little bit less return so that

1559
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,358
comes from like those

1560
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,318
orangey sort of things and but yeah

1561
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:35,838
so it's interesting have you done any

1562
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:39,119
work with the whole

1563
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,159
you know the the how should i say newly

1564
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,640
discovered

1565
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:43,358
land of terps in that people are adding

1566
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,759
you know like

1567
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:46,719
food grade terps back to concentrates

1568
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,640
and stuff now and

1569
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,039
the overwhelming feedback i've heard is

1570
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:53,358
that it's it's not quite the same and

1571
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:53,679
it's definitely not as good as if it was

1572
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,480
like

1573
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,838
natural terps in there do you know much

1574
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,358
about this and how do you feel about the

1575
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,759
turp scene do you feel it's like the new

1576
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:04,880
flavor of the month thing

1577
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,839
um yeah i think for the future i think

1578
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,960
it's going to hold a lot of benefits the

1579
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,558
terps

1580
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,358
um i think breeding point of view as

1581
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,480
well

1582
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:19,838
certain terps are definitely

1583
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,400
stock mites certain terps encourage mice

1584
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:24,798
to come to the plant so i think that

1585
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,079
side of things but the whole thing about

1586
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:30,639
adding other plant tips to

1587
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,119
cannabis extract and all that i don't

1588
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:35,118
agree with that to be honest

1589
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,880
i think tips are quite a volatile sort

1590
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,160
of solvent anyway

1591
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,559
to be smoking a lot of

1592
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:43,759
um but yeah i think it's going to be

1593
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,440
interesting what

1594
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,000
all this testing and stuff like that

1595
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,119
brings to the table

1596
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,960
and so do you feel like the same testing

1597
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,079
requirements that exist in the states

1598
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,519
should be

1599
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,559
you know in spain as well yes

1600
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:02,318
um but like

1601
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,599
the whole how it's going legal in the

1602
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:05,119
states and

1603
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:07,119
what they're going to implement and

1604
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,798
stuff like that i don't know if i agree

1605
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,920
with all of it totally

1606
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:15,119
and it just opens up the market for

1607
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,838
big companies basically like you've got

1608
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,000
scott's miracle girl that's brought out

1609
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:20,480
gavir

1610
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,079
and general hydroponics and all these

1611
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,719
these other companies

1612
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,440
um they're not good companies and these

1613
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,759
are the people

1614
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:32,720
that will end up um taking control

1615
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,119
like monsanto and bayer taking control

1616
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,838
of

1617
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,240
other parts of the fruit and vegetable

1618
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:41,358
market and seed market as well

1619
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,239
um and then you mix plant poisons into

1620
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,519
that and

1621
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:46,798
yeah it's not it's not good i think it's

1622
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:50,239
going to go in the future

1623
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,239
i think it's going to be very controlled

1624
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,838
so what's the concentrate seem like in

1625
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,640
general

1626
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,558
in the uk you know in the states it's

1627
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,318
seems like it's completely overtaken the

1628
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,760
flower scene for the you know the

1629
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:03,440
general consumer

1630
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,359
do you feel like that's the progression

1631
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,079
that's happening for the eu in general

1632
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:08,159
or

1633
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,440
maybe in the uk but not spain or maybe

1634
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,039
vice versa

1635
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,119
what do you think it's what do you think

1636
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,719
is happening sorry

1637
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:19,200
yeah um i think like

1638
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,639
the extract scene is becoming more

1639
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:23,838
popular

1640
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,879
it seems to be a younger generation

1641
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:26,639
thing as well

1642
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,119
with the whole dabbing and stuff like

1643
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:32,719
this um

1644
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:36,079
i'm getting into it a little bit um

1645
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:38,159
but like yeah i think in

1646
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,920
the future i think smoking will be

1647
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:41,039
looked as like an old school way of

1648
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,639
doing it

1649
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:47,838
um but the scene

1650
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:49,598
here in spain yeah dabbing is very

1651
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:50,318
popular it's getting more and more

1652
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,880
popular

1653
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:53,440
barcelona yeah there's a big scene for

1654
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,599
it there's

1655
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,559
lots and lots of extract artists now

1656
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:01,200
over in spain

1657
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:03,760
and the uk um and they're bringing some

1658
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,639
beautiful tasting stuff to the table so

1659
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,400
yeah

1660
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,759
i'm competing with some of the americans

1661
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,358
even so yeah

1662
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,119
it's interesting to see what's what

1663
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,119
it'll bring

1664
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,200
so would you ever consider breeding

1665
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,400
specifically for terps or for

1666
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:21,358
concentrates so to speak

1667
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,160
yeah well i've sort of done that anyway

1668
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,920
by

1669
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:26,480
by breeding for uh trichome production

1670
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,159
and

1671
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:33,358
terps in general um like the jungle

1672
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,279
kush and the jungle juice they produce

1673
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:38,558
some crazy returns

1674
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,559
um so yeah

1675
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,280
people are people loving that is like an

1676
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:47,359
extract artist dream those two plants

1677
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,798
um so yeah i think that comes hand in

1678
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:52,318
hand with breeding

1679
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:55,599
good flower you breed

1680
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:58,480
good extract strains and because

1681
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,920
if you're breeding for flavor i think

1682
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,240
that's one of the main things

1683
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,039
try complexion obviously you select for

1684
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,358
the plants with

1685
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,319
big big trichome production that can

1686
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,960
produce

1687
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,400
lots of terpenes the terpenes that you

1688
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,000
choose that you like so

1689
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,920
yeah okay

1690
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,079
and so a question i was thinking about

1691
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,240
is how often do you think it's the case

1692
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,079
that someone grows out a pack of maybe

1693
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:24,000
yours maybe anyone's seeds

1694
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,839
and they think to themselves oh this

1695
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,519
finna is not so good

1696
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:29,038
and then like maybe they ditch it but

1697
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:30,960
the truth is maybe they just didn't grow

1698
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,720
out that well because recently

1699
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,000
i've grown a few things again that i

1700
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:36,000
initially thought were bunk

1701
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,199
but they're from people i really respect

1702
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,159
i was like you know what i'll give it

1703
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,399
another go

1704
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,318
lo and behold completely different way

1705
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,599
better totally worth keeping

1706
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:44,798
do you think that's like something which

1707
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,920
happens a lot because you mentioned

1708
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,679
earlier you're like yeah there's you

1709
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,039
know there's winners in every packet

1710
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:50,719
do you think maybe there's a bit of that

1711
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,880
going on for people who maybe disagree

1712
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:56,480
with that

1713
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,599
um yeah i think that just comes down to

1714
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,599
selection

1715
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:05,200
like when i first started breeding

1716
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:07,119
i seen this more with the plants like

1717
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,639
the plants that i was selecting and

1718
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,559
using

1719
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:12,400
i would see this variation where you

1720
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,359
were getting some really nice plants and

1721
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,599
some plants

1722
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:20,078
not so nice but as

1723
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,119
you know that's progressed i don't see

1724
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,480
that so much

1725
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,318
in my lines um and even lines from other

1726
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,880
people

1727
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:31,119
i've grown bodies things this year i've

1728
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,119
grown some stuff from colorado

1729
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,358
i've grown some stuff from south fork

1730
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,480
seeds yeah their stuff does really well

1731
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:40,480
outdoors

1732
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:44,480
um and i've all amazing work from

1733
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,000
each one of them so yeah

1734
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,559
so the interesting thing i just took

1735
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,400
away from that is all of those are us

1736
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,960
breeders as well as many of the other

1737
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,280
breeders you've mentioned so far

1738
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,519
what do you think is the go with there

1739
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,599
not being that many breeders

1740
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,440
in the eu scene despite there being a

1741
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,480
really big market

1742
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,519
do you think that more people from you

1743
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,318
know

1744
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:11,358
uk for example need to you know pick up

1745
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,798
their game and start releasing things or

1746
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,078
why do you think it is you know there

1747
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:19,199
aren't that many eu breeders

1748
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,798
um i think there's lots of them

1749
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,639
um i think there's a good one there's a

1750
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:23,920
lot of yeah there's a lot of [ __ ]

1751
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:27,519
companies out there

1752
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,039
like just producing i

1753
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:31,358
i don't even know what they're producing

1754
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:34,960
now i see some

1755
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:36,880
so like yeah like there's so many of

1756
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,880
these little spanish companies and dutch

1757
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,280
companies popping up all the time

1758
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,480
and a lot of spanish people grow these

1759
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,640
seeds they like cheap

1760
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,159
feminized seeds and when you see the

1761
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:49,598
results everything's just

1762
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:52,159
sub standard uh weed

1763
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,640
it's just yeah it's just shame to see

1764
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:56,960
because

1765
01:04:52,639 --> 01:05:00,078
if they were actually growing uh

1766
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,798
plants that were actually starting from

1767
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,240
good seeds they could produce some

1768
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:05,679
amazing flower out here

1769
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:07,838
so this is where it comes down to

1770
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:10,558
genetics again

1771
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:11,679
these these these [ __ ] seed companies

1772
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:15,119
that use

1773
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,118
uh not very good genetics that are just

1774
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,440
making feminized seeds because

1775
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,240
that particular plant produces a lot of

1776
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,318
pollen

1777
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,279
yeah and it's good for making feminized

1778
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,358
seeds

1779
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:32,720
it's just polluting the the market with

1780
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:35,119
um substandard uh genetics

1781
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,239
so something you may or may not have an

1782
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,559
opinion on

1783
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,239
how do you feel about the way strain

1784
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,599
hunters notably

1785
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:45,919
you know kind of went to

1786
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,920
other countries and just diluted or

1787
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,798
polluted i should say

1788
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,720
the genetic gene pools you know with

1789
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:54,880
their stock in exchange for land races

1790
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:56,480
because it's almost kind of like

1791
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,480
what you're describing in a way like

1792
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,318
just coming and giving inferior stuff to

1793
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,159
the locals and

1794
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:06,480
they just don't know yeah i think that

1795
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,000
whole thing was crazy when i seen that

1796
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,798
um well elite he he's got a nice genetic

1797
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,400
library now of all the nice land races

1798
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:16,079
and he's polluted it for anybody else to

1799
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,400
go back to but

1800
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,359
these people like you tell these people

1801
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,798
that uh

1802
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:24,960
you can get twice as many uh

1803
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,400
twice as much yield and you don't have

1804
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,838
to pick up males

1805
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,519
and these people are going to go with

1806
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,400
that this is how

1807
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:34,318
uh monsanto has taken over parts of

1808
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,960
africa with certain

1809
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,719
uh things that they've produced so it's

1810
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,199
just the same thing as that really

1811
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:43,038
like going around to these places and

1812
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:45,279
polluting

1813
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,599
uh and it's not even like he's given a

1814
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,440
few seeds to one little farmer and say

1815
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,280
keep that little patch or something like

1816
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,480
that he's literally gone there with

1817
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,599
kilos of seeds

1818
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,679
and taking kilos of their seeds it's all

1819
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,599
crazy to be honest

1820
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,279
yeah the immediate thing i thought of

1821
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,039
it's almost like a crude way of like

1822
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,000
copyrighting it you know because as you

1823
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,680
said it's like

1824
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,960
you've got your library no one else does

1825
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:11,279
yeah that's what he'll be doing in the

1826
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,318
future um i think unless

1827
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,960
this yeah he's he's looking to the

1828
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:17,599
future

1829
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,639
where he can pay in certain strains or

1830
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,359
stuff like that

1831
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,960
yeah definitely yeah it'll be

1832
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:24,558
interesting to see what aryan's game

1833
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,838
plan is now that

1834
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,720
the main workhorse there is no longer

1835
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:30,880
there

1836
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:32,078
yeah franco was a good guy he had a true

1837
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,440
passion for the plan now

1838
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,960
yeah shame he's gone yeah i totally

1839
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,639
agree with you franco

1840
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,798
in my opinion did all the work and it

1841
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,279
was so pretentious the way aryan

1842
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,038
named everything after himself when he

1843
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,599
almost openly admitted he didn't do any

1844
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,599
of the work

1845
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:50,960
yeah it's a shame to see

1846
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,960
oh well hopefully some good new dutch

1847
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,480
companies can take their place

1848
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,159
an interesting idea i wanted to ask you

1849
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,079
about though is do you think that people

1850
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:00,798
who are aspiring breeders throughout the

1851
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,079
eu

1852
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:05,119
should move to spain for example to help

1853
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,599
get things going

1854
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,200
i guess the underlying idea is is it

1855
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,000
better to try to

1856
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:12,719
have one more person you know like doing

1857
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,238
the right thing

1858
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:18,960
being a good breeder but in spain

1859
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:19,519
or to stay in the illegal country kind

1860
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,158
of you know

1861
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,239
fight the hard fight but not be able to

1862
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:27,439
reach your full potential and you know

1863
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:30,158
offer what you could maybe

1864
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:32,559
yeah i think even in spain it's hard

1865
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:33,278
like i can't achieve my full potential

1866
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,440
out here

1867
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,679
this is why i'm looking towards maybe

1868
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:40,079
working with somebody in america

1869
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,600
to sort of get a lot more of my genetic

1870
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,000
lines over there

1871
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,039
maybe work some of the lines on a on a

1872
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,158
bigger scale

1873
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:48,960
larger selections um because that can't

1874
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,158
be done here

1875
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,520
it's still a very big gray area i think

1876
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,318
anyone who's thinking about coming to

1877
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,880
spain

1878
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,640
should definitely look at all the laws

1879
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,000
come out here first speak to people that

1880
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,440
are already living here

1881
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,279
um and judge it for themselves

1882
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:08,639
yeah so do you think it's possible for

1883
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,279
the average person

1884
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,359
to make a living like let's let's let's

1885
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,960
be actually really optimistic about it

1886
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,560
let's say you live in america and so

1887
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,319
and you're a really good grower like

1888
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,920
you've got validation of it like you

1889
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,679
know dispensaries will pay top dollar

1890
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,399
for your type stuff and it's it's really

1891
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,480
good

1892
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:28,318
so you're thinking to yourself yeah if i

1893
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,278
moved to spain i could definitely grow

1894
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,520
stuff it's real good

1895
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,560
sell it to dispensaries you know yadda

1896
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,920
yadda

1897
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,600
do you think that that's actually

1898
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,838
possible or do you think like no like

1899
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,960
you

1900
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,960
you know you're not gonna get enough

1901
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,920
money for it you need to have other

1902
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,520
stuff going on

1903
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,520
like how do you see it

1904
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,319
um because i'm not really in that scene

1905
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,159
in barcelona

1906
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,080
i don't know how that would work there i

1907
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:55,439
don't know how it really works there

1908
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:57,359
um but with it going sort of

1909
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:00,238
more legal and they're going to sort of

1910
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:02,559
regulate the grow rooms and that

1911
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,079
maybe i think maybe maybe they might

1912
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:08,000
even go towards that way

1913
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:09,760
yeah so another thing that's going to be

1914
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,119
interesting to see over the next year or

1915
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,840
so

1916
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,640
yeah well interesting if we were going

1917
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,039
to talk about

1918
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,760
some of the traits that you look at in

1919
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,479
males

1920
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,280
and think that that indicates a superior

1921
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:23,119
male

1922
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,960
what are the sum of things you like on

1923
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:25,760
males that you think indicate you know

1924
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,279
this is going to be

1925
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:32,719
my breeding male okay

1926
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,639
uh resistance you know how how well it

1927
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,760
copes with things number one

1928
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,880
um the growth

1929
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,440
um i like to tend to go for like

1930
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,279
like a slightly shorter time mail

1931
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:47,519
because when they do go into flower they

1932
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:50,639
tend to stretch out a lot more

1933
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:54,000
um short internodes

1934
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,119
between the spacing um the smell of the

1935
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,479
stem was something i

1936
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:59,039
always used to go by and when it dropped

1937
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:02,479
pollen

1938
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:06,238
as well not those males that dropped too

1939
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:09,759
early you know um

1940
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,479
and obviously resin like the the males

1941
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,920
that you can

1942
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:17,279
get resin from and smell them uh

1943
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:19,520
they are the special meals yeah

1944
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:22,559
and do you find that that flavor or that

1945
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,120
smell correlates

1946
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,600
yes yeah i'd like to actually start

1947
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:31,119
reversing some of my males

1948
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:34,159
and turning them female to actually see

1949
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:36,238
uh how they end up

1950
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:38,879
that's something i'd like to i haven't

1951
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:40,639
done that i'd like to start doing

1952
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,319
it just as a bit of a random side

1953
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,560
question would you ever consider doing a

1954
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:47,840
pollen release

1955
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:51,120
yes yeah but you know i've actually uh

1956
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,840
um got some pots here at the moment

1957
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:54,238
and i was thinking of doing a little

1958
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,940
giveaway of

1959
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,039
just uh three

1960
01:11:56,939 --> 01:12:02,158
[Music]

1961
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:04,560
three packs of seeds and one little

1962
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:06,238
tube of pollen to someone someone that's

1963
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,360
already grown out my strains as a little

1964
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,519
giveaway

1965
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,599
so yeah i definitely look towards doing

1966
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,360
something i like in the future

1967
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,199
yeah and what would be some of the

1968
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:16,719
strains you'd want to do for the pollen

1969
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:17,759
release because obviously

1970
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,439
as a breeder you could do it

1971
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,480
strategically because you can think all

1972
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:22,158
right

1973
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,959
what is something i would want to get

1974
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:26,639
out there because you know best case no

1975
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,480
someone breeds with it makes something

1976
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,079
amazing and you know whenever something

1977
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:31,359
amazing is around people always look at

1978
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:34,880
the parents and think

1979
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,880
you know i'd like to try that type thing

1980
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:41,679
yeah i it would be the mandarina

1981
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,399
and uh the mantis uh because of the two

1982
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,560
sort of turps

1983
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,158
it does pass over it's quite a dominant

1984
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,520
both of them are quite dominant

1985
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:52,559
uh mantis passes over this lime

1986
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:56,080
zest and the mandarina passes over

1987
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,840
that orangey citrus turp so

1988
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:00,079
they would be the two pollens i would

1989
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,079
actually uh probably look towards giving

1990
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:04,079
out

1991
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:05,039
okay and so if we just jump back to what

1992
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,840
we're talking about before with the

1993
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:08,000
breeding

1994
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,400
an idea commonly brought up and i think

1995
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,560
notably i've heard this from sub cool is

1996
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,439
he says that he believes the males

1997
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,080
particularly

1998
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,079
bring the flavor do you find that is an

1999
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,559
accurate rule of thumb or it really just

2000
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,559
varies

2001
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,480
the male brings flavor let me think so i

2002
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,600
guess if you wanted me to like elaborate

2003
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:29,439
a little bit more

2004
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,120
you know your selection of the male

2005
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:32,960
that's what brings the flavor so for

2006
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:34,079
example you could have a female which is

2007
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,079
really nice

2008
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:37,600
got really good flavor but if the male

2009
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,920
you pick if if what his

2010
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,920
profile is is not good you know that's

2011
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,760
going to dominate more so so do you feel

2012
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,440
like the male you're using crosses

2013
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,600
dominates them

2014
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:49,839
yeah yeah i think that plays a big role

2015
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,360
if you're if you're selecting a male

2016
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:56,480
um the outcome from that cross can be

2017
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:58,079
varied and this is where you get

2018
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,519
some plants that are amazing and other

2019
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:01,760
plants that you just look at i think oh

2020
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,920
i just wouldn't even smoke that

2021
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:07,199
so yeah i think that plays a big role in

2022
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,119
so what about this idea i've been

2023
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,919
thinking about right

2024
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,279
is the best female for breeding a

2025
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,880
dominant one

2026
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:20,000
in that a lot of people i feel

2027
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,920
buy seeds more so for

2028
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,039
the mother than the father because

2029
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,319
there's a lot of people out there

2030
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:27,279
notably say

2031
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:28,639
sub cool who a lot of the strains use

2032
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:30,479
the same father

2033
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,679
again and again and so it's like the

2034
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:33,839
people buying these seeds

2035
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,440
obviously interested in the mother what

2036
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,039
it brings to the table so with that

2037
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,719
being said is the best mother

2038
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,719
not one that's very dominant so that

2039
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,960
people can ideally find a good replica

2040
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,800
of it in the 10-pack

2041
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,079
yeah like even males that are

2042
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,480
non-dominant so

2043
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:50,319
when you cross a male everything that

2044
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:51,839
comes is more like the mother i find

2045
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,840
some males are like this like a

2046
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,079
non-dominant male

2047
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,279
so it doesn't matter what you cross that

2048
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:59,279
male 2

2049
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:02,399
so many of the females are coming out

2050
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:04,639
like the mother that you cross it to

2051
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:07,759
so i think that plays a big role as well

2052
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:11,199
and that comes down to selection again

2053
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,600
okay and so how do you find you select

2054
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:12,559
that

2055
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,239
do you just have to do it the

2056
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,440
old-fashioned way and you know make some

2057
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,238
seeds grow them out

2058
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:20,000
and test them and test yeah yeah time

2059
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:24,319
time consuming

2060
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:27,039
so use multiple males on the same female

2061
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,639
all of different on different females

2062
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:31,359
though so you don't mix the pollen

2063
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:34,719
and then test those seeds out and see

2064
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:38,719
which males pass over what traits so

2065
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:40,880
yeah only way it can be done

2066
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,719
so how many seeds do you like to pop

2067
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,719
when you're popping one of your strains

2068
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:48,560
to get a bit of an idea of you know if

2069
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:50,880
it's a good line if it's worth releasing

2070
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,239
okay um i'll pop a couple of packets

2071
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,719
myself and i'll give

2072
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:56,399
out a few packets to friends that will

2073
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:59,439
grow straight away

2074
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:01,359
and then give out a few to maybe a few

2075
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,719
selected people from online or something

2076
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,759
like this

2077
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:09,279
and then see the results from that and

2078
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:11,440
that's how i tend to do it now um

2079
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:14,639
just with this new one i've done so many

2080
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:16,719
new crosses with the jungle kush

2081
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,640
but i've just started so many seeds

2082
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:20,319
outside and

2083
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,760
they've vegeta for a few weeks and

2084
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:23,920
they've gone into flowers they're all

2085
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,000
very short but i'll get a good idea

2086
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,158
of which ones i want to continue working

2087
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,359
with or test more

2088
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:34,158
so um yeah like from

2089
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,719
each strain i you i want to be seeing

2090
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:37,198
like

2091
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,920
from 50 i can get a bit of a percentage

2092
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,479
from 50

2093
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,480
females

2094
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,960
and would you ever consider providing a

2095
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,000
little bit

2096
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,679
more kind of detailed information on

2097
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,679
number of phenotypes what you could

2098
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,600
expect from each phenotype that type of

2099
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,600
thing because we have seen more breeders

2100
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,800
switch over to providing you know these

2101
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,039
more kind of

2102
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,840
thyroid analysis particularly on f1

2103
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:02,238
where it's you know there is a bit more

2104
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,239
variation

2105
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:06,639
yeah if you go on breed bay we used to

2106
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:08,158
have to fill out a form

2107
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,000
and then you can see it all there and it

2108
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:10,799
says how many phoenix of each type and

2109
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,600
everything

2110
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,880
so i used to do this a lot more but i

2111
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,719
see that

2112
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,319
so many people are just like not even

2113
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,439
interested they just want to know what

2114
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:21,439
the mother is

2115
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:22,799
and what the fire is and what is crossed

2116
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,319
with and

2117
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,920
it's all about the name it seems

2118
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,599
nowadays but

2119
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,279
i always tend to jot all these things

2120
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,520
down i've got notebooks and

2121
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:32,800
everything so maybe i'll put that in the

2122
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,640
catalogue as well

2123
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,719
but if you go on breed by a lot of my

2124
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,520
older strains and the mantis and stuff

2125
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,158
like that

2126
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,640
you can actually see and it says there

2127
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:43,359
you know

2128
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,679
the parents how many phenas of each type

2129
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:46,880
and

2130
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:49,199
explains everything yeah so something

2131
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,719
i've noticed over the past kind of

2132
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:53,198
year or so that i've been doing the show

2133
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,279
is i've been keeping tight tracks on

2134
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:57,039
which seed values are stocking who and

2135
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:58,158
things like that for various reasons and

2136
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,840
something i've noticed is

2137
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:01,439
your seeds have been increasingly

2138
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,719
getting to more seed banks getting out

2139
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,079
there more and more

2140
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,439
have you found that it's been like an

2141
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,119
easy thing or it's been a bit of an

2142
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:08,719
uphill battle and what should people

2143
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:12,479
expect if they're looking to get their

2144
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:15,600
seeds out there into the market

2145
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:18,000
um yeah it's hard

2146
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,679
hard to sort of maybe crack america a

2147
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,198
little bit more

2148
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:26,480
but i think i've had quite a few people

2149
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:30,319
buying from america and canada

2150
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:32,158
since i sort of started on breed bay so

2151
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:33,599
we had a lot of american people on there

2152
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:37,359
and at the time

2153
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,800
so cool was on there um bodhi was on

2154
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:41,759
there

2155
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,039
gooey breeder sun simulator quite a few

2156
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,719
people so

2157
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:50,238
like there was it was a a good little

2158
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:51,840
uh community so a lot of people came

2159
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:54,959
there bought seeds

2160
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:58,480
so i've had quite a

2161
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:01,760
american-based market for a while but

2162
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:04,879
it all comes with time and

2163
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,640
i think now that it's all about seems

2164
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,960
about all about cups and

2165
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,159
what you've crossed it with that seems

2166
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,520
to be the

2167
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:17,039
how you sell seeds now more than

2168
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,199
how much work's actually gone behind it

2169
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:23,279
i think that's more for the connoisseur

2170
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:23,839
type grower and so like with that being

2171
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:26,158
said

2172
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,920
do you not feel like it's really

2173
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,319
important for you to try to

2174
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,480
win as many cups as possible assuming

2175
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:33,759
they are based on merit

2176
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:37,119
because you know it is going to have a

2177
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:40,320
flow-on effect of sales

2178
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:43,439
um yeah um i'd like to

2179
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:44,158
enter the ic markup again just because

2180
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:46,479
of how

2181
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:48,839
transparent it is and you you get to see

2182
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:52,238
everything

2183
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:55,760
um i wasn't really into cups in the past

2184
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:58,399
um but recently i've entered a few and

2185
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:00,000
we've got a few cups so that's that's

2186
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:02,719
been that's been good

2187
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,600
but yeah i think it's always good to um

2188
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:08,000
enter one every now and again

2189
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,440
yeah but maybe in the future i'll

2190
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,479
probably stay away from most of them

2191
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:13,279
just stick with the

2192
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,638
ic mag ones or maybe any new ones that

2193
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:16,000
pop up which are a little bit more

2194
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:19,359
transparent

2195
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,079
yeah so overall what would be your

2196
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:22,639
advice

2197
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,760
to you know a new aspiring breeder

2198
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:25,440
what's

2199
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,360
what's the best way for them to get into

2200
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:28,559
the market should they look to develop a

2201
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:30,639
library first

2202
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,080
what should they do before they try to

2203
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:34,400
start getting their work out there to

2204
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:36,399
the masses

2205
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:39,119
grow as many different genetics as you

2206
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:42,719
can create a library

2207
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:44,880
um selection

2208
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,560
do your selection make your seeds pass

2209
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,199
them to people give out so many seeds

2210
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,280
for free

2211
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:51,439
i've given up so many seeds for free

2212
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:54,800
just give out your seizure

2213
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:58,839
and um i think

2214
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:01,199
the seeds will speak for themselves and

2215
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,440
um yeah i think that's the best advice

2216
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:03,439
really

2217
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,279
so what point did you make the jump from

2218
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,279
just you know

2219
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:10,399
like making some seats for yourself to

2220
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:14,479
thinking you know what

2221
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:18,479
i'm gonna sell this yeah um

2222
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:21,039
i was making a few um

2223
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:23,439
different strains uh making a few

2224
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:24,960
different crosses and stuff like that

2225
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:26,638
and people would show an interest like

2226
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,079
asking well when are you going to put

2227
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,840
them on breed breedway

2228
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,238
so i sent out a lot and people were

2229
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:36,079
putting up pictures and growing them

2230
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:38,238
this was around 2007 2008 and then

2231
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:40,319
that's when i sort of created trichome

2232
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:44,718
jungle seeds

2233
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:47,679
and yeah uh it went from there really

2234
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,079
but it's only more recently that i've

2235
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:51,440
had

2236
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:54,719
a bit more of a influx of

2237
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:55,599
uh interest and sales and stuff like

2238
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,840
that is

2239
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,960
from the whole american market i would

2240
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,000
say yeah

2241
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,000
how it's going over there

2242
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,079
okay interesting and so what do you

2243
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,000
think is going to be the next big thing

2244
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:10,000
to hit the american market and are you

2245
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,920
already working on something for that to

2246
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,319
cater to it

2247
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,199
um yeah i'm working on a few things at

2248
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,479
the moment and

2249
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:19,919
mainly the jungle cush crosses so

2250
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:21,678
i've crossed so many different things

2251
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,960
with jungle kush i think the main ones

2252
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:27,600
are going to be like the

2253
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:31,439
the tahoe tk across with the jungle kush

2254
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:35,280
the sfv tk with the jungle kush

2255
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:37,919
um the girl scout cookie crossed with a

2256
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:38,238
cherry pie across with the jungle kush

2257
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,920
so

2258
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:44,319
those three um are in testing at the

2259
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,960
moment which i think are gonna be like

2260
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:48,639
yeah well the parents i've selected are

2261
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,039
amazing so

2262
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,319
we'll see how all the testing goes so

2263
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:53,119
they're going to be the main ones i'm

2264
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:56,238
going to be

2265
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:57,359
releasing soon um i released two

2266
01:22:56,238 --> 01:23:01,119
recently

2267
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:02,559
which was uh the hadoo ken which is the

2268
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,519
sunset sherbert

2269
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,880
cos cross with a cookie crisp from

2270
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,320
colorado

2271
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:15,039
and i crossed that with the jungle kush

2272
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:18,079
and the jungle rose which is a cross of

2273
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:22,238
from motive 303 of

2274
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:25,439
uh fruity pebble oh g with you dub

2275
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:25,919
and i found this uh like fennel that has

2276
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:29,359
this like

2277
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,399
rose water turp so that's the one that i

2278
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:33,279
selected

2279
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:34,479
and crossed with the jungle kush as well

2280
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:36,479
so

2281
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:38,479
yeah and everything's coming out amazing

2282
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:41,599
so we've just finished testing that and

2283
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:44,079
just done a release on both of them

2284
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,639
crystal ship is a strain that caught my

2285
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:48,000
eye

2286
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:50,560
because it uses kodiak gold which is not

2287
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,319
a well-known strain from reefer man

2288
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,840
um how do you feel about it you know

2289
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:55,198
would you consider using it again or is

2290
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,679
it one of those ones that's kind of long

2291
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:57,678
gone

2292
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:06,400
um yeah i used it at the time and

2293
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:10,479
it was a nice selection but

2294
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:14,158
now from the gene pool i've got

2295
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:16,959
it it's not a standout plant

2296
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:19,759
and plus i probably i wouldn't want to

2297
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:23,920
work with reef man stuff anyway

2298
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:27,039
um yeah i do go on

2299
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:29,359
um i don't like some of his

2300
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:31,279
uh views he's had in the past i know

2301
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,119
people changing that but yeah

2302
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:35,519
i i'll probably stay away from his

2303
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:38,800
genetics from now on

2304
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,719
yeah no worries and so if we then jump a

2305
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,159
generation forward galactic smurf you

2306
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:45,119
know you use crystal ship

2307
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:45,920
you crossed it to an australian pony boy

2308
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:47,760
i always love

2309
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,840
unknown strains tell us about this one

2310
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:53,920
what was the go with him

2311
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:57,119
okay ponyboy um these seeds came to me

2312
01:24:53,920 --> 01:25:00,319
a high times cup one year uh

2313
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:03,599
from coyote seeds yeah

2314
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:06,238
there's some like mad american guy

2315
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,560
um and he had like this picture of all

2316
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:11,519
that little smurfs everywhere

2317
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,280
and like he put them all in his birth

2318
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,040
and some seeds and he had all these

2319
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:15,519
different crosses with the smurfs and

2320
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:17,600
stuff

2321
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,880
and that's where i got those seeds from

2322
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,920
but i can't find

2323
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,359
any information about this guy at all i

2324
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:27,600
don't know if you've ever heard of

2325
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:29,679
coyote seeds no

2326
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,800
okay so that's that's where it came from

2327
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:34,239
yeah

2328
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:36,000
okey-dokey so we mentioned the jungle

2329
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:38,079
kush a few times

2330
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,719
do you think that this is kind of gonna

2331
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:41,439
be your masterpiece so to speak or do

2332
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,679
you envision

2333
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:44,799
envision there ever being a masterpiece

2334
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,039
or do you think

2335
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,960
you'll just continue on with strains and

2336
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:51,279
just keep working things until you find

2337
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:55,279
a new thing to work on

2338
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:56,800
um yeah like every year i'm finding just

2339
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:59,920
new things and

2340
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:04,320
like it's unbelievable how

2341
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:06,639
how many different um

2342
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,439
smells that this plant can produce like

2343
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,840
okay so

2344
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:11,359
ev every couple of years i'm i'm finding

2345
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,880
something that stands out

2346
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:14,479
that i might i've never smelled anything

2347
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:18,239
like this before

2348
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:20,238
so i don't think i think creating

2349
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:21,279
con we're always creating we're always

2350
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:24,399
learning

2351
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:26,960
throughout life so yeah i think

2352
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:28,079
that's how i'll take my breathing yeah

2353
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,279
and

2354
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:33,198
constantly learning from this plant and

2355
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,800
constantly creating new things all the

2356
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:38,158
time but the

2357
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:40,719
jungle kush at the moment

2358
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:41,279
amongst everybody that's uh growing it

2359
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,000
and

2360
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,840
extracting from it is one of the

2361
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,520
standard strains

2362
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:51,440
alongside the jungle juice um

2363
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,199
i think the jungle juice will probably

2364
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,359
become almost an elite like

2365
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:56,238
because there's not many seeds of that

2366
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:59,679
left now

2367
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:04,079
in circulation so it'd be interesting

2368
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:08,079
i haven't got the sour diesel um

2369
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:12,559
uh it's like a res dog sour diesel but

2370
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:15,359
karma selected it so i reversed that

2371
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,199
to make that and also the orange soda so

2372
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,960
i haven't got that anymore

2373
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:24,559
so um we'll see how i work that line

2374
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:26,319
further in the future maybe we'll see

2375
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,400
so it's interesting you mentioned karma

2376
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:30,399
i had a question you know you've used

2377
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:30,719
some of karma's strains in a whole bunch

2378
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:33,119
of

2379
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:35,279
different strains of your own is there

2380
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:36,559
any other breeders out there besides the

2381
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:39,279
ones already mentioned you know

2382
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,320
colorado got a bunch of big ups is there

2383
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:43,359
any other breeders who

2384
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:46,559
you would consider using their work

2385
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:49,679
see karma stuff i like his og lines

2386
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:53,120
is his cush biker kush

2387
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,960
and that was a real nice plan uh

2388
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:56,158
i even liked his headbanger that was a

2389
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,560
good one

2390
01:27:56,158 --> 01:27:59,519
um me and him don't work too much

2391
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,199
together anymore

2392
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:05,840
he used my mandarina on a few crosses uh

2393
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:07,279
i made a few mandarina crosses for him

2394
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,199
and

2395
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,479
see working with other breeders in the

2396
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:13,198
future

2397
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:15,198
um maybe some collabs or something like

2398
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:16,719
that maybe some limited things

2399
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:21,039
that have been quite interesting with

2400
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:21,039
some people yeah we'll see how things go

2401
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:26,400
okay so just to clarify things went sour

2402
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,880
because he made the mandarina cushions

2403
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:31,920
or you made them for him

2404
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:35,279
um do you know what that was

2405
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:38,000
uh that was yeah

2406
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:41,198
somebody else actually made them right i

2407
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,319
i gave someone a mandarina clone

2408
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:47,359
um and they just pollinated a plant

2409
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:49,679
so he ended up with some seeds from some

2410
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:51,439
some guy that he was using to make some

2411
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:55,119
seeds for him

2412
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:56,879
so that's where they came from and then

2413
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:58,158
he's used the same name put the same

2414
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,119
name on it and

2415
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:02,319
releasing his freebies now yeah that is

2416
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:04,960
probably down to

2417
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,158
the things going sour between me and him

2418
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,039
um

2419
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:10,960
but yeah some it happens a lot in this

2420
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,679
game and

2421
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,079
i see a lot of breeders they they fall

2422
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:19,119
over certain things

2423
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:22,399
um but yeah

2424
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:23,760
it's uh how things go sometimes and so

2425
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:26,079
how do you feel about the idea of

2426
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,159
asking for permission to use someone's

2427
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:30,000
work you know is like mandatory or just

2428
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:31,759
respectful

2429
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,119
no i think it's respectful to ask

2430
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,840
someone

2431
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:37,279
it depends it depends like what your

2432
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,560
intentions are with the seeds if you're

2433
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:39,359
going to be making a lot of money from

2434
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,760
it or not then

2435
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:43,198
yeah i think the people need to be asked

2436
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,199
um

2437
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:46,559
if you're going to be doing a little

2438
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:48,960
limited drop

2439
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,639
or giving them out for freebies or

2440
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,800
something like this

2441
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,920
um i don't see it as too much of a big

2442
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,480
problem

2443
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,719
um people are welcome to use anything

2444
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,559
from any of my seeds

2445
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:03,920
i say always you know select a male

2446
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:07,600
select a female make things cross things

2447
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:09,440
it's how we all start so um

2448
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,639
yeah i don't have a problem with it

2449
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:12,559
myself

2450
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,760
uh a few people have used my things and

2451
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,600
not asked

2452
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,360
and it doesn't really bother me to be

2453
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,360
honest

2454
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:21,679
and so if we jump back to that uh

2455
01:30:19,359 --> 01:30:24,399
african land race idea for a while

2456
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:25,359
will we be seeing any african crosses in

2457
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:27,599
the future

2458
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:28,880
notably i see you have the caribbean

2459
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,199
crush you know

2460
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,560
guess not africa most people are

2461
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:36,000
thinking of but

2462
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:39,520
nevertheless an african strain

2463
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,800
yeah well that was a a solution

2464
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:44,320
and me and sonic went to saint lucia

2465
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,600
i'm trying to come and it was probably

2466
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,599
about 2000 and

2467
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,679
nine or something like this and we went

2468
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:55,519
to a field there

2469
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:59,119
we uh the the variation was unbelievable

2470
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,920
you had like 12 foot sativas and you had

2471
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:02,800
like

2472
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,440
tiny little two-foot plants next to it

2473
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:07,440
so

2474
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:09,599
like because of the season there um

2475
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,198
so we went round we collected some

2476
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,679
flowers with the things that taste

2477
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:14,638
smell the nicest took them back dried

2478
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,560
them

2479
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,679
tasted them selected some seeds from

2480
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,920
them

2481
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:22,000
and a lot of them hummed when grown

2482
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,079
indoors

2483
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
yeah a lot of them uh hurt when grown

2484
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:29,198
indoors and delights

2485
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,960
and but then out in spain

2486
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:33,599
i found a nice one and i pollinated that

2487
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,198
with the

2488
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:40,000
month with the uh i had the mantis

2489
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:42,479
and i had the some lucian and i

2490
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,520
pollinated them both with the headbanger

2491
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:48,479
so i made like the sour mantis and the

2492
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:51,280
caribbean crush at the same time

2493
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,919
so but that was a real nice strain as

2494
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:55,679
well

2495
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:59,119
like it had that almost tropical

2496
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:02,158
but zesty

2497
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:02,479
going on with it but yeah it was a nice

2498
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:05,679
one

2499
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:07,519
we selected from that field an idea i've

2500
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:09,600
had for a little bit now is

2501
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,920
do you think that the most memorable

2502
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,320
crosses are ones that produce really

2503
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,440
unexpected but awesome flavors like for

2504
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:17,439
example

2505
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:18,879
if you cross a chocolate strain with a

2506
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:20,559
strawberry strain and you think you know

2507
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,520
i'll get like you know chocolate stories

2508
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,800
or whatever

2509
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,719
and then it comes out and it's like

2510
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,000
rotten meat and like maybe it's like

2511
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:27,119
phenomenal you know like something like

2512
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,399
that was just like you know totally

2513
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:29,920
doesn't really add up

2514
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:31,759
do you feel like those are often the

2515
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,359
most memorable ones or

2516
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,000
sometimes the predictable ones are the

2517
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:38,238
best as well

2518
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
yeah no i think the ones that really

2519
01:32:38,238 --> 01:32:42,238
like for me when i grow

2520
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
things and someone says it's a cross of

2521
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:47,039
this and this

2522
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,039
and then i grow it and it's it produces

2523
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:50,238
a smell that's nothing like any of the

2524
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:53,279
parents

2525
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:56,399
and really unique and unusual

2526
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:58,960
that for me is something special and

2527
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:02,319
and i've come across that a couple of

2528
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:04,158
times this year with a few things

2529
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:06,840
and they've become part of the library

2530
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:09,679
so people will see a lot more from those

2531
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:12,880
things and a little history on each one

2532
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,480
soon in the future so yeah

2533
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,920
and so just as a bit of a random

2534
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:18,718
question

2535
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,359
how important do you rate aesthetics

2536
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,000
within

2537
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:23,920
your whole breeding operation do you

2538
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,840
value it highly would you ever

2539
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,520
knock a strain back from market if you

2540
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:31,119
thought oh it doesn't really look good

2541
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:35,040
but it was like really good smoke

2542
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:38,399
um no probably not

2543
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:40,880
but like i'd sort of uh

2544
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:43,279
explain it a little bit like you get

2545
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,880
some like varied phenos and

2546
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,279
some a small yielding and something

2547
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,719
large yielding or maybe

2548
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,559
like you get something like with like

2549
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:53,119
even i'd consider some

2550
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,679
cookie crosses like they they have these

2551
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:58,800
like almost freaky

2552
01:33:55,679 --> 01:34:00,560
um stunted almost vino's where the buds

2553
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,760
don't want to grow too big and stuff

2554
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:05,120
like this

2555
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,960
so yeah i'd explain all that

2556
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:08,880
and so just as another bit of a random

2557
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,439
question if you were going to enter a

2558
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,880
cup

2559
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:12,638
would you want to enter something which

2560
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,480
you thought was just really well grown

2561
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,480
or like would you also want to have like

2562
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:18,959
a bit of that real wild card

2563
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:21,198
factor of like throwing some real unique

2564
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:24,880
flavor or terpene profile out there

2565
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:27,678
what would be your kind of aim um

2566
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:30,079
most of the time i'd like to enter a

2567
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:33,520
strain that i've got in seed form

2568
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:36,639
and athena that represents the strain

2569
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:40,320
that he so uh

2570
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:43,520
if it does win people can have the seeds

2571
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:44,639
and a good representation of what has

2572
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,719
actually won

2573
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:51,840
i think that's a good thing to go for

2574
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,480
and so do you have any kind of old

2575
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:56,079
school

2576
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:57,678
genetics or any kind of wild cards

2577
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:59,840
you're looking to breed within the near

2578
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:00,639
future or you know pop in the near

2579
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,319
future

2580
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:05,920
potentially work with um

2581
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,198
definitely a few of the land race

2582
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,079
collection is definitely going to be

2583
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:12,399
coming out

2584
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:15,600
i have some hunza pakistani strains

2585
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:18,960
uh was becky uh

2586
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:21,440
some african australians again yeah so

2587
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,880
i'm interested in fluffing some of them

2588
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:24,319
because i haven't grown any of that for

2589
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:28,560
a long time

2590
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:30,639
um what else uh

2591
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,080
yeah i think more of the laundry because

2592
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,600
i've i've been

2593
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:37,198
starting a lot of seeds from other

2594
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:40,480
breeders a lot of my own stuff

2595
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:43,678
um i think it's time to do

2596
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:47,118
a little uh landry selection and

2597
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:48,639
see what comes about how would you want

2598
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:50,399
to work now let's just say you did pop

2599
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:52,239
it in you got some good numbers of

2600
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:54,158
let's just say just one would you want

2601
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:55,519
to cross it with a certain strain or

2602
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:59,359
would you want to

2603
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:03,600
breed it a few generations yeah i've got

2604
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:07,118
already got like brazilian and

2605
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,679
thai so i'd probably look for something

2606
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:11,359
in there

2607
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:14,960
us becky strange or the citral strain

2608
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:17,599
or even the hunza and find

2609
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:19,279
something a little bit more on the

2610
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,840
indica side

2611
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:27,039
and cross that with the uh the

2612
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,039
um mexican time

2613
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:31,198
and so what type of like you know let's

2614
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:32,479
say you do have this crazy hybrid what

2615
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:34,000
type of work would you want to do with

2616
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:35,359
it then would you want to

2617
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,118
keep working it to the point where it's

2618
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:38,719
stable or be offering something like you

2619
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:39,359
know it's a bit more wild kind of like

2620
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:41,600
what bode

2621
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:44,799
is doing now what's kind of the end goal

2622
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:49,520
for the the land races

2623
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:52,800
um it'd be nice to create something

2624
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:56,880
totally from scratch uh

2625
01:36:52,800 --> 01:37:00,320
from the well the originals um

2626
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:03,199
and then uh work that line yeah

2627
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:05,599
uh even work it outside would be nice

2628
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:09,519
each year maybe do a little patch

2629
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:11,600
so yeah that would be quite interesting

2630
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:13,199
and let's just say worst case scenario

2631
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,079
you got the seeds to the top

2632
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:17,919
but they were all showing herm traits

2633
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:19,600
would you try to line breed it and weed

2634
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,118
them out or would that type of thing

2635
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:25,199
just indicate too much effort for you

2636
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:26,559
yeah i try and work away from that and

2637
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:29,599
especially outdoors

2638
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:31,360
i'd expect not to see it as much with

2639
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,960
a lot of these strains i know it's

2640
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:35,839
they're prone to it and

2641
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,719
it's natural but i try and work away

2642
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:39,760
from that

2643
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:41,679
yeah you can breed it out

2644
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,960
how many generations would you expect it

2645
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:45,520
might take because i mean

2646
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,600
something i noticed is in the earliest

2647
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:48,719
ssc magazines for example they would

2648
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,840
often say

2649
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:53,840
bread for generations shows some

2650
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,600
hermaphroditic traits still

2651
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,039
and so that was something you know the

2652
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,199
best stock there was so

2653
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:00,639
to me it makes me think well obviously

2654
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:02,319
it's not worth just throwing in the

2655
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,239
tower immediately but

2656
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,399
it might take a few generations and to

2657
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:08,079
me four sounded like they maybe got

2658
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:09,920
lucky like i would almost expect it to

2659
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:11,600
have taken more to really

2660
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,279
taking a good step away from those

2661
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,960
trades especially because they're

2662
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:16,079
recessive if like they're all herming on

2663
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,198
the first generation

2664
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:20,719
right yeah i'm gonna say

2665
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:23,839
you could do it in four or five

2666
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:25,840
generations i reckon

2667
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,039
interesting and depend depending on what

2668
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,319
you're starting with

2669
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:31,760
yeah yeah yeah and so

2670
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,679
i guess if we jump back to strain

2671
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,920
hunters for a moment do you think there

2672
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,560
is

2673
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,359
there is any real pure land races left

2674
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,600
or they've just

2675
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:41,599
all been diluted in one form or another

2676
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:46,799
i think a lot of places have been

2677
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,840
diluted for a long time

2678
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:53,440
um other small

2679
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:56,719
islands and maybe hard to get to

2680
01:38:53,439 --> 01:39:00,719
places have still got things and

2681
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:02,960
even if it's only one or two

2682
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,840
packets that have been brought to these

2683
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,480
places

2684
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,319
and then introduced natural selection

2685
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:10,319
again will get rid of them

2686
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:13,359
and they'll revert back to their sort of

2687
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:16,960
almost natural sort of stuff anyway

2688
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:18,880
so um i think there are still some

2689
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:23,679
places out there with

2690
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:25,920
some uh land race strains

2691
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:29,359
what places would you like to go and

2692
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,359
search for some land races

2693
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:34,319
i think maybe some uh indian genetics

2694
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:37,198
would be nice to

2695
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,399
add yeah i think india would be maybe a

2696
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:42,000
nice place to go and

2697
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:44,479
collect some seeds is that just because

2698
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,639
you're into hash

2699
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:52,879
um yeah i think the whole hash thing

2700
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:55,199
um the culture

2701
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,000
yeah it'd be interesting to see it all

2702
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:58,638
and uh

2703
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,840
collect some seeds from that next on the

2704
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:05,199
list after that would probably be uh

2705
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,880
south america and just to see some of

2706
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:10,559
the stuff there

2707
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:13,840
um yeah

2708
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,840
okay how do you feel about strains that

2709
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,560
throw nana's at like the end of the

2710
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,840
cycle

2711
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,679
you know the ones that do it rather

2712
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,639
predictably do you feel like that's a

2713
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:25,440
negative trait or it's just kind of like

2714
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:26,960
something you deal with yeah i don't see

2715
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,238
it as a problem

2716
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:33,920
um i find that sometimes

2717
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:37,039
i see it from the agent orange before

2718
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,800
but they were always unfertile um

2719
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:40,479
and never ever made seeds you could even

2720
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,679
pick them out and try and make a seed

2721
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:43,279
from them and they just wouldn't

2722
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:45,920
pollinate so

2723
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:48,559
um and it's almost like a natural

2724
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,560
defense if you've pushed a plant out and

2725
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,159
you get a few nana's at the top and that

2726
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,520
i i i don't see it as a

2727
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:57,439
as a huge problem yeah another one i

2728
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:00,639
wanted to run by you is

2729
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:02,638
i myself have seen a bunch of plants be

2730
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:03,279
revedged before and when i say revenge i

2731
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,440
mean

2732
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:06,559
they've been taken more or less full

2733
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:08,719
flower

2734
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,199
and just trying to re-veg from that

2735
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:13,520
point do you feel like when you do that

2736
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:15,439
often it's kind of detrimental to the

2737
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,080
plant in that the plants may be

2738
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:19,599
not quite the same as when it was first

2739
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:21,600
flowered out do you like do you tend to

2740
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:24,320
lose any traits from re-veging or do you

2741
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,480
find that's not the case

2742
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:27,920
um i think that depends on the genetics

2743
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:30,959
um i've seen

2744
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,560
like things where uh me or a friend was

2745
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:37,600
veg stuff out

2746
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:39,280
uh re-badged and um taking clones again

2747
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,360
growing those plants out and they've

2748
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:45,840
been identical

2749
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:49,198
so um i think genetic drift

2750
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:52,480
in general can happen

2751
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:53,759
down to genetics and the health of the

2752
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:55,759
plant in general

2753
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,440
so if you can reverse that plant and get

2754
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:00,880
it healthy

2755
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:03,198
nice clones coming off of it

2756
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,679
then i think you'll get good results

2757
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:05,678
back again

2758
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:10,000
so do you agree with the idea expressed

2759
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,560
by many of our guests

2760
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,359
in that a poor clone room in terms of

2761
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,159
the quality

2762
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:18,479
results in a degradation of quality over

2763
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:18,479
time

2764
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,198
yeah if you're taking clones of poor

2765
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:26,560
mothers

2766
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:27,279
then yeah i've seen it with the cheese

2767
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,080
clone

2768
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:31,359
in the uk and people taking clones off

2769
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:32,880
it clones off it and when they start

2770
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:36,079
taking clones off

2771
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:39,118
poor mothers i start seeing

2772
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:41,118
um the outcome

2773
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:42,799
like the plants don't bubble up like

2774
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:44,319
they normally do they don't fill out

2775
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,880
like they normally do

2776
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:47,759
maybe the buds are a little bit smaller

2777
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,079
um

2778
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,880
even down to like taste and smell can be

2779
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:54,079
lacking

2780
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:59,118
so it can happen over time so

2781
01:42:54,079 --> 01:43:02,479
keeping your mothers uh healthy

2782
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:04,000
is key definitely and so you mentioned

2783
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:05,599
earlier that you're organics and you're

2784
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,039
really into that now what type of

2785
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,639
growing

2786
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:10,000
style do you use specifically you know

2787
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:11,279
what are you feeding your plants what

2788
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,880
are you feeding your mothers to keep

2789
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:16,559
them healthy what are you

2790
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:20,639
giving them in all regards okay

2791
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:24,719
um before i was doing it mainly with a

2792
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:28,000
cocoa and bottled nutrients

2793
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:31,359
um but uh now

2794
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,880
i'm back to organics i'm using a lot of

2795
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:36,399
like uh

2796
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:40,560
slow release um powdered

2797
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:43,920
organic sort of amendments um

2798
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:47,119
making like some ferments

2799
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,399
uh aloe vera i use that a lot in coconut

2800
01:43:47,118 --> 01:43:52,319
water

2801
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:56,000
um bean ferments

2802
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:58,559
uh what else if i can get nettles

2803
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,600
that depends on time of year um make

2804
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,760
some nettle tea

2805
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:06,800
comfrey tea stuff like this um

2806
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:10,400
but yeah um going on

2807
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:14,000
those along those lines now um

2808
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:16,479
outdoors i've always done it organic and

2809
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,279
always indoors i've always done organic

2810
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:19,678
until i

2811
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:21,279
come out to spain really so it's only

2812
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,639
been the last couple of years i did the

2813
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:25,679
coco

2814
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:30,239
um but also a

2815
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:32,560
good way to test test plants yeah

2816
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:34,000
just quickly touch on the outdoors are

2817
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,840
you enjoying the outdoors more

2818
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,359
i mean given you're into your hat i

2819
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,560
imagine you would that's something i've

2820
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:40,399
always seemed to notice

2821
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,400
people say that the outdoor hash is

2822
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:44,079
unbeatable because even though you know

2823
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:45,599
maybe the bud doesn't look quite as good

2824
01:44:44,079 --> 01:44:47,439
as indoor because you know there's a bit

2825
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,800
of dirt a bit of wind and all that

2826
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:50,479
that you know the trichome heads are

2827
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,920
still perfect and you know the sun

2828
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,759
spectrum is number one

2829
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,560
so how do you feel about it or where

2830
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:59,760
does the outdoors sit for you

2831
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:03,199
yeah i think the sun

2832
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:06,320
light depth weed is uh

2833
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:09,599
by far the best that you can get

2834
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:11,920
the sun produces like

2835
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:13,039
terpenes that you just don't get when

2836
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:16,079
you do it indoors

2837
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:19,118
i think indoors

2838
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:23,359
organic you can achieve similar outcomes

2839
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:26,880
but still not like like the sun

2840
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:30,319
um i think

2841
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:33,520
um chemical fertilizers or like

2842
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:34,719
mineral salts or whatever and they can

2843
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:39,440
produce like maybe

2844
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:43,198
a little bit stronger weed but the turps

2845
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:45,678
outdoor under the sun

2846
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:48,158
is the way forward um i've been getting

2847
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:51,440
into a couple of books from uh

2848
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:53,839
jeff lowenfels and

2849
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:54,638
uh what's the other guy called something

2850
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,960
lewis

2851
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:58,480
um but they're like the teaming with

2852
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,719
microbes

2853
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,238
and teaming with fungi teaming with

2854
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:06,480
nutrients

2855
01:46:02,238 --> 01:46:10,319
and they've been uh really good books

2856
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:12,000
um putting into practice a lot of

2857
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:14,319
knowledge i've gained over the years

2858
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,920
through like sort of growing like a

2859
01:46:14,319 --> 01:46:18,238
permaculture

2860
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,158
type garden vegetables in that sort of

2861
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:20,879
style a lot of companion planting anyway

2862
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:22,559
so

2863
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,679
it's good to put all this into practice

2864
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,520
now with cannabis outside

2865
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:29,600
and the garden outdoors this year is

2866
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,119
just looking amazing

2867
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,360
yeah so that's something you mentioned

2868
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:35,439
to me earlier that you do grow a lot of

2869
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:37,359
food and stuff and i think you even said

2870
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:38,879
you keep some bees you know

2871
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:40,319
how does all that play into things do

2872
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,000
you think that people do grow

2873
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:43,359
organically should try to make an effort

2874
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,479
to grow their own food and things like

2875
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:46,158
that seeing as

2876
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:49,759
they've got the skills and often a lot

2877
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:52,479
of the uh the inputs as well

2878
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:54,400
um yeah like bees i used to keep bees

2879
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:57,198
when i was living in the uk

2880
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:58,799
and now that i've moved to spain i i've

2881
01:46:57,198 --> 01:47:01,118
stopped keeping bees

2882
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,800
um but growing food i think everybody

2883
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:05,599
should grow their own food

2884
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,639
um or try it like what it comes down to

2885
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,719
is where you live

2886
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:10,480
and land a lot of people don't have the

2887
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:14,239
land a lot of people don't have the time

2888
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:16,000
to do it um but if you have the time and

2889
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:20,158
you've got the land there

2890
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,158
definitely gross grow some food

2891
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:24,800
you've got the skills so put it put it

2892
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:27,118
put it into practice yeah

2893
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,440
and a lot of people grow organic but

2894
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:31,599
then they don't eat organic food so

2895
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:33,759
you know going along those lines as well

2896
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,360
when you're growing your own food

2897
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,800
and you know everything that's gone into

2898
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:39,920
it

2899
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:41,279
do you feel like you do have like a

2900
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,679
better

2901
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:45,439
view on the whole plant now that you do

2902
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:46,480
do it organically like i guess what i'm

2903
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:47,919
trying to say is

2904
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:49,839
a lot of people say to me when they grow

2905
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,279
organically they feel kind of more in

2906
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:53,920
tune with their plants

2907
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:55,118
not in necessarily like this weird hokey

2908
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,880
pokey spiritual way

2909
01:47:55,118 --> 01:47:58,960
but in a sense of like you know they

2910
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,639
really understand the cycle they

2911
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,399
understand how it's all working whereas

2912
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:04,159
the stuff in bottles can still be a bit

2913
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:05,839
smoke and mirrors at times

2914
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:07,198
do you feel like you have that better

2915
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,880
link with your plants in

2916
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:10,399
either way whether it be spiritual or

2917
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:13,520
just like you know a more fundamental

2918
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:16,559
understanding of the cogs and wheels

2919
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,600
yeah like organically it teaches you

2920
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:21,520
everything about

2921
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:24,000
how that soil works how that plant works

2922
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:26,320
um and when you're actually making all

2923
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,079
these things yourself

2924
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:30,719
this is what so many people are missing

2925
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:32,479
out on on is the actual understanding of

2926
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,239
what they're feeding their plants

2927
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:36,559
so many people grow and don't even know

2928
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:39,279
what mpk is

2929
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,159
and it's just like yeah you need to be

2930
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:43,039
understanding it

2931
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,879
all of this stuff and organic really

2932
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:48,960
teaches you that

2933
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:51,840
and yeah being around your plants

2934
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,639
all the time making these things feeding

2935
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,400
it too and that's

2936
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:57,760
that's another connection with with

2937
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:59,599
nature and that whole cycle

2938
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,360
i think it was jeremy from builder soil

2939
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,920
who said there's a certain

2940
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:07,118
romance about the end quality product of

2941
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:10,480
organics do you feel the same

2942
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:12,158
um yeah definitely definitely it has

2943
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:15,198
something special about it

2944
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:19,279
when it's organic sun grown

2945
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:21,198
it it it's at its most natural way of

2946
01:49:19,279 --> 01:49:24,319
how it should be

2947
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:27,439
um you're getting everything

2948
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:29,519
yeah it it's just the perfect way

2949
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:30,960
basically

2950
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,719
so you mentioned earlier that you do a

2951
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,599
lot of your own ferments and things like

2952
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:36,239
that now

2953
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:38,159
do you get much into the whole knf type

2954
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:38,959
of thing or you just kind of starting to

2955
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:41,519
dip your water

2956
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:43,840
dip your toes sorry into the whole water

2957
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,920
of all the various ferments and how that

2958
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:48,159
interacts with it all

2959
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,960
yeah i'm just like this is what i'm

2960
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:51,519
looking into

2961
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:53,439
more because before i came out to spain

2962
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,679
when i was doing organics before

2963
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:56,559
a lot of it was a lot of bottled feeds

2964
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,599
yeah i'd like

2965
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:01,599
use some slow release powdered

2966
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:05,360
amendments and stuff like that

2967
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:07,199
but this way of doing it is is is

2968
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:09,198
well i used to do nettle teas with the

2969
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:10,158
garden and comfrey teas and stuff like

2970
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:14,319
that

2971
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:14,319
but then this whole uh

2972
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:17,920
fermenting and stuff like that this is

2973
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:20,399
all new

2974
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,000
definitely so i'm looking into all this

2975
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,879
now

2976
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,158
and what some of the uh the newest

2977
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:28,079
products or

2978
01:50:26,158 --> 01:50:31,359
ideas you're looking to delve into or

2979
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:31,359
implement in your own garden

2980
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:37,199
um yeah like you were saying then build

2981
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:38,560
the soil and stuff like that i've been

2982
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:39,439
looking into a few of these other

2983
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,119
companies

2984
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:43,519
that do these uh amendments and

2985
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:47,519
definitely trying to use a few

2986
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:51,119
uh broader variety of things in in my

2987
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:54,239
feeds and soil mixes

2988
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:57,118
uh and even composting uh

2989
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:58,000
i'm starting to do a lot more composting

2990
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:00,079
and

2991
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,238
i used to have worm farm and stuff like

2992
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:05,519
that like in the uk

2993
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:06,079
quite a few bins of worms and i think i

2994
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:10,639
need to get

2995
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:13,760
more into that so yeah definitely

2996
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:16,960
look towards that does the

2997
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,639
spanish scene have you know like a build

2998
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,239
a soil equivalent is there a place where

2999
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:23,359
you can get all of the amendments you're

3000
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:25,039
after or is it still a bit of a struggle

3001
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:26,559
no there's nothing like that this is

3002
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:29,679
what i've sort of

3003
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,560
it definitely needs uh it's lacking on

3004
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:34,000
that side

3005
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:37,440
but as progression happens more of these

3006
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,920
stores will start to get these products

3007
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:42,399
i'd like to see a store that only stocks

3008
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:44,560
organic products i've not seen that so

3009
01:51:42,399 --> 01:51:46,319
far i think that would be a

3010
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,719
a really good thing to do out here in

3011
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:49,759
spain yeah because all of these products

3012
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:52,000
are hard to get

3013
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:53,679
and it's quite a big agricultural

3014
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,840
industry over here

3015
01:51:53,679 --> 01:52:02,079
um but they like to spray a lot of

3016
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:03,520
chemicals and chemical fertilizers on

3017
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:07,198
everything

3018
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:09,920
so yeah i love how your voice just like

3019
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:09,919
trailed off

3020
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:14,800
so how would you describe the scene in

3021
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:17,199
general in spain is it mostly people

3022
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,520
growing organic outdoors given there's

3023
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:21,118
the availability or is it pretty well

3024
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,800
infiltrated by that

3025
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:24,639
commercial scene as you referenced with

3026
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,679
the synthetics

3027
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:31,039
no like any of the commercial

3028
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:34,239
um standard of spanish

3029
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:36,399
uh cannabis is is quite

3030
01:52:34,238 --> 01:52:38,799
low really i don't know how they're

3031
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:42,399
growing it but everything has a certain

3032
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:44,239
smell or taste to it when i see it so

3033
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:46,719
i'm not too sure what some of these

3034
01:52:44,238 --> 01:52:50,479
people do use

3035
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:53,279
um but yeah

3036
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:55,039
not organic but then everybody that

3037
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:57,679
grows for themselves

3038
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:59,439
on a personal level tends to go down the

3039
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:02,880
organic line

3040
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:05,118
um which is good a bit of a weird

3041
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:07,440
political question

3042
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:10,000
what would you rather do would you

3043
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:13,678
rather live in a situation where

3044
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,960
it's illegal but you're growing your own

3045
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:19,039
or it's legal but the only people

3046
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,719
supplying it are like you know big

3047
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:22,560
corporations and there's a lot of

3048
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:25,039
question marks over the quality

3049
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:27,840
and you know kind of safety checks in

3050
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:27,840
the whole process

3051
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:31,920
if it has to be legalized to be

3052
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:35,679
normalized

3053
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:38,399
and not be felt like a criminal

3054
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:39,480
then that's the line we have to go down

3055
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:42,559
but

3056
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:46,638
decriminalizing it is the way forward

3057
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:49,599
um but then yeah i just

3058
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,239
it's it's a it's a hard question that

3059
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:54,000
but

3060
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:57,519
yeah i think it needs to go legal and uh

3061
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,520
be um

3062
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:01,519
i don't think he should be put in the

3063
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,880
government's hands like i think there's

3064
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:08,000
enough people out there that can there's

3065
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:11,118
ways of regulating it in different ways

3066
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,560
yeah that's not how it will go well i

3067
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:14,238
mean just touching on the idea of

3068
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,080
regulation you referenced earlier that

3069
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:18,479
you think the price of weed should go

3070
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:19,920
down let's just move that idea over to

3071
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:22,000
seeds though we're seeing

3072
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:23,199
a general increase in the price of seeds

3073
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,118
as time goes by

3074
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:26,238
some say it's in accordance with

3075
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:28,559
inflation

3076
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:29,279
others say it's getting out of hand in

3077
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,360
some

3078
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:32,639
in some respects how do you feel about

3079
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:34,158
that and you know do you think there

3080
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:36,719
should be some regulation on the price

3081
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:39,679
of seeds ultimately

3082
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:40,880
um the seeds are worth what what people

3083
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:44,639
can sell them for

3084
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,118
yeah um my seeds i think in general are

3085
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:48,560
quite

3086
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:50,479
cheap um i think i could even maybe

3087
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:54,239
lower the price a little bit

3088
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:56,238
um depending on how much work was

3089
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:59,198
involved in each strain

3090
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:00,079
um some feminized strains don't produce

3091
01:54:59,198 --> 01:55:04,559
many seeds

3092
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:08,559
so you have to charge a bit more and

3093
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:09,520
but then uh i think it's gone crazy with

3094
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:13,039
like when people are

3095
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:16,400
charging 300 400 500

3096
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:19,920
a packet but then

3097
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:22,799
it's the market that people pay this

3098
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:25,359
um and then people think if something's

3099
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:29,279
500

3100
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:30,960
and something's 50 the 500 one's got to

3101
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:34,479
be better

3102
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:36,158
so people buy by price

3103
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:37,919
i think so many people we do it in the

3104
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:40,960
shops we do it with food

3105
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:45,359
we do it with clothes and

3106
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:45,359
so people do it with seeds

3107
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:50,960
and so do you think that there are

3108
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:53,520
or should i say do you think that there

3109
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:54,000
is a max price which no one should go

3110
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,520
over

3111
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,639
or do you think it's just really like

3112
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,119
you know if you want it and you'll need

3113
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:01,039
to pay

3114
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:04,719
go for it um

3115
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:06,800
i'd pay uh a high amount for a special

3116
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:10,158
packet

3117
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:13,119
um of something old maybe

3118
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:14,719
so this place wasn't about anymore well

3119
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:16,079
yeah if i play devil's advocate do you

3120
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:18,880
remember

3121
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:20,800
uh starfighter you know that that there

3122
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,359
was some auctions for a while and that

3123
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,360
got

3124
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:26,719
you know very expensive very quickly um

3125
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:28,158
you know do you think that was out of

3126
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:29,039
hand or like that's the type of thing

3127
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:32,319
which merits

3128
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:34,639
what you're talking about um

3129
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,599
yeah auctions are different and i

3130
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:37,118
remember when the

3131
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:39,520
it was i think it was the alien

3132
01:56:37,118 --> 01:56:42,559
technology went on to auction

3133
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:44,320
and that it was like when it was crazy

3134
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,239
prices for a packet

3135
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:48,000
but people have used that in the future

3136
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:51,598
for breeding stock

3137
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:54,840
i had a good little story behind it um

3138
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:57,920
so yeah um certain things sell

3139
01:56:54,840 --> 01:57:00,319
um but to have a release

3140
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:01,840
of and if you've got thousands of

3141
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:04,799
packets

3142
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:05,279
and you're charging a huge amount for

3143
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:09,520
each

3144
01:57:05,279 --> 01:57:10,559
packet and i think that's down to morals

3145
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,880
isn't it

3146
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,080
a topic you just briefly touched on

3147
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,239
auctions

3148
01:57:14,079 --> 01:57:17,920
we've seen a dramatic rise in the number

3149
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:19,519
of auctions especially on instagram

3150
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:21,199
recently

3151
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,199
how do you feel about this does it feel

3152
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:24,319
like we have too many auctions er

3153
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,079
auction's a bad thing

3154
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:28,559
i guess the thing i noticed mostly is

3155
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:30,479
that people will often discredit really

3156
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,840
expensive purchases and say oh yeah but

3157
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:33,279
it was for an auction so you know it's

3158
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:34,639
kind of like different rules or it's in

3159
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:36,479
play right now

3160
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:39,840
but i mean if they're just constantly

3161
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:39,839
happening is it not the new norm

3162
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,359
are you talking like charity auctions or

3163
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:46,399
is it like

3164
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:47,359
yeah the majority of them are charity

3165
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:48,638
auctions i mean i

3166
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:50,559
i don't think i've really seen that okay

3167
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:51,440
yeah for charity but yeah it seems like

3168
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,360
they're just

3169
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:54,879
non-stop now on instagram wherever you

3170
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:57,679
look

3171
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,159
right i remember a couple popping up and

3172
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:00,639
i

3173
01:57:58,158 --> 01:58:02,479
donated some seeds and stuff like this

3174
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:06,239
and i remember checking and go for like

3175
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:10,238
crazy price for one packet um

3176
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:12,000
but then it's for a good cause and

3177
01:58:10,238 --> 01:58:13,439
if there's more and more and more of

3178
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,960
them popping up

3179
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:16,479
maybe people need to look into it a

3180
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:19,039
little bit more about

3181
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,158
you know but yeah i don't see it as a

3182
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:22,158
bad thing

3183
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:23,198
if it's the charity and it's for a good

3184
01:58:22,158 --> 01:58:26,799
cause

3185
01:58:23,198 --> 01:58:30,638
and people do it all the time with other

3186
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:34,079
other other industries

3187
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:35,279
and people who hold options and parties

3188
01:58:34,079 --> 01:58:39,198
and stuff like that

3189
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:41,198
and so uh

3190
01:58:39,198 --> 01:58:43,439
yeah why not do it with some seeds as

3191
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:46,638
well if it goes to a good cause

3192
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:48,719
yeah no worries all righty last question

3193
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:52,079
for the extended response

3194
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:54,480
is breeding an art or a science you know

3195
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:56,079
do you think that you could pass all

3196
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:57,439
your knowledge onto someone or at the

3197
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:57,920
end of the day you need to have a

3198
01:58:57,439 --> 01:58:59,598
certain

3199
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,960
something within you you know like a

3200
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:03,360
sense or a knack

3201
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,319
whatever it may be you want to call it

3202
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:08,158
do you think that yeah

3203
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:08,158
it's it's an art or it's a science

3204
01:59:08,479 --> 01:59:15,678
um i'd say it's a mix of both yeah

3205
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:17,599
um it's just things that you've learned

3206
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,599
along the way and some things can't even

3207
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:22,639
be explained it's just through

3208
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:24,719
things that you've seen um but

3209
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:27,039
definitely you can

3210
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:28,399
teach people a lot and save them a lot

3211
01:59:27,039 --> 01:59:32,399
of time

3212
01:59:28,399 --> 01:59:35,198
by telling them what you know um

3213
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:36,079
so i'd say it's a it's a mix of both

3214
01:59:35,198 --> 01:59:38,960
definitely

3215
01:59:36,079 --> 01:59:41,439
it's a bit of art and a bit of science

3216
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:44,480
all mixed in

3217
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:44,799
okay awesome so now for our last little

to the eu scene since you've been active

3257
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,920
forward to that at the moment

3258
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:32,079
um yeah

3259
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:34,079
the list is too long just to pick one

3260
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:38,479
but i'm happy to get the bubba back

3261
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:43,039
and i think uh

3262
02:01:38,479 --> 02:01:43,039
sfvog cushion yeah

3263
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:48,399

love the sfv don't they

3265
02:01:48,399 --> 02:01:51,920
so next question though what is the

3266
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,679
worst strain

3267
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,239
you've ever had the privilege of trying

3268
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:56,239
or growing

3269
02:01:57,118 --> 02:02:01,679
um oh

3270
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:05,840
i've grown a few packets of uh

3271
02:02:06,079 --> 02:02:10,399
greenhouse stuff that a friend gave me

3272
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:14,000
that it weren't very good

3273
02:02:10,399 --> 02:02:16,479
um what else

3274
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,198
something that i bought okay i bought a

3275
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:20,559
packet of

3276
02:02:17,198 --> 02:02:21,118
soma seeds nyc diesel expecting a nice

nyc

diesel thing and didn't find

3279
02:02:23,699 --> 02:02:27,920
[Music]

3280
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:31,119
the nyc diesel i was looking for that

3281
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:35,039
was a little bit disappointing i suppose

3282
02:02:31,118 --> 02:02:38,158
um but yeah

3283
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:40,719
um i think

3284
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:42,238
random seeds that people give you and

3285
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:44,239
you think okay i'll try it out

3286
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:45,678
years ago and you just find a lot of

3287
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:49,759
[ __ ] stuff from that as well

3288
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:51,118
yeah so what's the biggest mistake

3289
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:53,520
you see people making when they're

3290
02:02:51,118 --> 02:02:53,519
growing

3291
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:03,119
um

3292
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,760
over feeding yeah um

3293
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:06,559
giving the plant too many bottled feeds

3294
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,639
thinking that

3295
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:10,400
this is gonna do this this is gonna do

3296
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:13,440
that that's gonna do that

3297
02:03:10,399 --> 02:03:14,319
and they end up with weed that's had a

3298
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:18,158
build-up

3299
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:21,359
doesn't burn very well um

3300
02:03:18,158 --> 02:03:25,598
yeah so i think

3301
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:25,598
people that add too much to the plant

3302
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:31,279
and what's a little breeding tip for all

3303

02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:46,158
any packet of seeds that you've grown

3307
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:49,360
out that you find in

3308
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:50,319
a lot of females you like collect a

3309
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:53,679
little bit of pollen

3310
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:54,399
dust it on something and grow those

3311
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:58,480
seeds out

3312
02:03:54,399 --> 02:04:02,799
give them out for free you know um
