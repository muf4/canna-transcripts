uh uh was in Mexico in the early 80s and

171
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:32,598
acquired it down there and

172
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:35,159
um I just recently got it uh seeds

173
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:36,759
uh um two years

174
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,879
ago

175
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:45,038
and I ended up Crossing it with a uh 72

176
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:49,120
tie stick that I got from uh

177
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,839
Jim James who recently passed away from

178
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,840
Alaska Cannabis

179
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:56,079
cash um I don't know if you know him or

180
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,239
not yep yeah we did an interview with

181
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,439
him oh you did yeah yeah it was actually

182
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,000
probably you know just about a month

183
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,000
before he passed away so I was you know

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,560
obviously very sad to hear of his

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,360
passing but it was sort of good timing

186
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,360
that we were able to record some of his

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,598
thoughts I'll have to go back and uh

188
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,479
find out where that is I'd like to

189
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,319
listen to that yeah I'll send you a link

190
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,959
no

191
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,039
problem yeah he was on his way down here

192
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:29,799
to to chat and we've been talking for I

193
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,360
don't know six months or so and we're

194
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,680
both Old-Timers and we had a lot of

195
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,000
things in common from the early

196
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,958
60s and

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,759
70s and uh he kind of he kind of opened

198
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:47,759
up and I opened up to him on some

199
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:51,399
certain old strains and stuff and

200
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:54,319
uh I was I was very uh lucky to be able

201
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,720
to uh connect with him he's are never

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,720
really met him but I mean we talked a

203
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,959
lot on the phone he was a really nice uh

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
really nice

205
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,679
guy yeah hugely that was definitely my

206
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,120
takeaway from uh our discussions just a

207
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,000
really generous nice guy so I mean

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,519
you've sort of got this line that's in a

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,759
sense in his honor you know when you

210
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,959
crossed it to his 72 tie what what were

211
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,319
the effects and the smells of the end

212
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:25,958
result of those

213
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:30,160
seeds um see what n taii

214
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:34,359
uh has a real uh uh

215
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:37,319
Juicy Fruit strong juicy fruit flavor

216
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,600
smell

217
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,879
and uh you know I don't know if

218
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,240
it's I'm not sure where it came from

219
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,519
because I had never grown that

220
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:52,560
particular one before or the 72

221
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:56,399
tie um but uh uh one way or another it's

222
00:09:52,559 --> 00:10:01,319
in there from one of the one of the two

223
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:05,200
and it's uh very strong uplifting long

224
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:09,240
lasting um it's one of the one of the

225
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,040
best old uh land race

226
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Mexicans see

227
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,399
wato um naar there's another one there

228
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,440
that's another one

229
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:24,039
and um purple Zas that's another one

230
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,640
that I've been working with

231
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,799
also but uh yeah so that's uh kind of

232
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,600
interested I'm going to probably grow

233
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,799
that

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:40,480
again um this year and

235
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:43,278
um see how it uh see how it turns

236
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,519
out that's beautiful to hear and look

237
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,000
I'd love to jump into some Mexican stuff

238
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,360
but before we go there I just want to

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,078
quickly ask I know you've got a lot of

240
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,320
experience with a range of different tie

241
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,679
varieties how would you say this 72 tie

242
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,040
stick from hay compared to some of the

243
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,039
others you're familiar with

244
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:09,040
um well I only grew it last year but I

245
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:12,120
mean um it wasn't uh as ay as I

246
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:15,958
thought and

247
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,440
um uh I basically seated everything so I

248
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:22,719
really didn't get a chance

249
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:26,279
to um smoke it unseated but uh it was

250
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,519
uh uh exotic from what I can remember

251
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,879
from the old

252
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,240
tie um kind of

253
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,200
a uh well not

254
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,759
lemony um I'm not real good at

255
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,560
explaining the flavors and stuff but uh

256
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,600
on traditional thae I I grew some uh

257
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:48,239
Lemon Thai before from another fellow

258
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,639
that lives over in Thailand and it was

259
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,839
very airy extremely long flowering um

260
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,600
lemony whereas

261
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,079
the this tie stick that I grew

262
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,120
would seem like that matured quicker

263
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:10,319
narrow leaves definitely

264
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,278
pure um I'm excited to smoke it again

265
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,480
and uh and um see what I think because I

266
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,278
really didn't get a chance to smoke it

267
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,800
without having a seed in

268
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,759
there that's very exciting we'll all

269
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:27,000
have to keep our eyes on that and see

270
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,799
how the project unfolds for you I I did

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,320
want to touch on some of the mech stuff

272
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,639
because you're the only person where

273
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,240
I've I've had two different breeders I

274
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:41,519
distinctly remember both bod and Mr Bob

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,000
Hill saying that totally unrelated you

276
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,959
know at different points in time they

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,559
both said to me that they think your

278
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,198
knowledge of Mexican cultivar is second

279
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,278
to none and that you've got a lot of

280
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,399
experience with them so that's quite an

281
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:56,278
Accolade from the two of them and so I'd

282
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,958
love to

283
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,919
hear John Snow high is much more

284
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,599
knowledgeable on the Mexicans than I am

285
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,479
but uh it's nice of them to say that uh

286
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,480
yeah look I think every everyone you

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,399
know sort of acknowledges John's wisdom

288
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,720
but you know on that same line of

289
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,399
thought I would love to ask can you tell

290
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,160
us a little bit about some of your

291
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,519
favorite Mexicans you know obviously

292
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,000
there's a lot and I don't expect you to

293
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,839
touch on everything but just maybe some

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,839
of your favorite ones uh well we share a

295
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:29,560
lot of those and then we a few years

296
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:33,920
back we both grew quite a few and

297
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:37,319
um um I'd say off the top the F my

298
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:41,319
favorite Mexicans would be the

299
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,560
narit um purple

300
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,800
zakas of course zat

301
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:52,000
Neo um chopus I grew years

302
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:55,319
ago but I had a problem with it and his

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,720
uh it was the same genetics that snow

304
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,160
high and I

305
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,240
had he seemed to do better with his I

306
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:05,159
think I might have had a little too much

307
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,759
uh too rich of soil for that because it

308
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,039
uh had a little bit of interex issues

309
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,079
which it shouldn't have and I think it

310
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:14,278
was I'm not really sure I think it was

311
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,599
probably that and we had a kind of a

312
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,159
weird year that year so the plant might

313
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,278
have been a little stressed

314
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:26,480
out I'd say that uh those are well I

315
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:29,759
mean well Haw I I like also but those

316
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,120
those are my probably my favorite

317
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm trying to think of anything else

318
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,519
mishan that was another good

319
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,680
one I haven't grown any of that in a

320
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,879
while

321
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:46,039
um yeah I think that those would be the

322
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:50,000
my favorites so

323
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:51,519
far wow what a diverse range of plants

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,440
there I'm sure a number of listeners

325
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,399
have just heard that and thought I

326
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,560
haven't heard of half of those strands

327
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,159
before how would you describe the

328
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,319
Mexican variety I for people in general

329
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,519
because I think that for most cannabis

330
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,800
Growers you tend to hear a lot about

331
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,959
Thai varieties and Southeast Asian

332
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,198
varieties but you don't hear as much

333
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,758
about Mexicans these days but they are

334
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,519
having a bit of a growing Resurgence how

335
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,560
would you describe the general effects

336
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,759
and flavors of Mexicans if people were

337
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,879
interested in

338
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,959
them um I think probably you don't hear

339
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,799
about them as much as they're getting

340
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:29,159
more difficult to find the pure lines

341
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:31,198
down there bod was down Mexico uh

342
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,799
oh a couple two or three years ago and

343
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:37,599
he only could find I think three pure W

344
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,599
hawan mines whereas the year or two

345
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,560
before that he found like I think six or

346
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,800
seven so they're getting harder and

347
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:49,838
harder to find but um I think a lot of

348
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:53,278
the old uh timers down there or maybe

349
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,480
grandkids or sons of some of the old

350
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,318
Growers down there have preserved some

351
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,159
of the old land race and not caught up

352
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:05,439
good got caught up with the

353
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:09,719
cartel growing [ __ ] down there and

354
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,440
uh you know and and you probably more

355
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,440
than lik you have to go to these obscure

356
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,839
places to find it I don't think it's

357
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,399
would be quite as easy for just somebody

358
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,639
to go down there and really find the

359
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,078
cream it's it's not impossible but I

360
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,318
think it would be difficult I might be

361
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:30,359
wrong but uh helps to know somebody and

362
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:33,120
uh have a connection down there for

363
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,440
sure as far as

364
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,278
the uh the

365
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,800
effects um

366
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:44,439
they're a lot of them are up high happy

367
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,799
giggly

368
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,480
um some are way more

369
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:53,639
expansive good

370
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,879
expansion um they can get quite large

371
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,480
like a lot of

372
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,799
plants large

373
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,440
colas

374
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,198
um I haven't really had too much many

375
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,318
problems with intersex issues with uh

376
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,199
the Mexicans that I've grown but I think

377
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:16,678
all all all land race trins have some

378
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:20,600
that uh do have those um issues and like

379
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:24,839
I said earlier a lot of it can be caused

380
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,399
from uh stress on the plant rich

381
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,440
soil

382
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,240
um light depping will Force the plants

383
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,038
to flower and a lot of them don't

384
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,798
they're well aware when they need to

385
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:38,119
flower to to

386
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:40,599
finish

387
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:44,079
um I have I have a real special

388
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:47,678
connection with uh the plants on

389
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,319
a uh you know spiritual basis I guess I

390
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,960
don't know that's really not quite the

391
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:55,480
term I'm looking for

392
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,120
but um they're they're uh they're

393
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,960
they're a a little entity in themselves

394
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,479
and

395
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,600
they they uh like you bring something

396
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,720
like say from Mexico or say Thailand

397
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,359
that's a whole

398
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,679
different

399
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:13,839
um range of uh temperatures over there

400
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:17,360
and bring the seeds over here and grow

401
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:20,599
them they're g to g to go till some of

402
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,759
them February I grew some uh last year

403
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,558
that I got and just to grow them out and

404
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:25,759
they were growing till February and then

405
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:27,960
finally

406
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,720
finished um and I haven't worked with

407
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,798
them since I didn't have that many seeds

408
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:37,880
but you know so the plants uh uh have an

409
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:41,798
inner clock and when they are ready to

410
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,400
flower and when they are declaring sex

411
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:47,960
so when you sometimes people force them

412
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,000
this back to this light depth um I found

413
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,000
that some of the land race don't really

414
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,279
care for that and they'll you'll get

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
interex issues not saying all of them

416
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,839
but

417
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,960
some yeah wow I mean that that certainly

418
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,079
makes sense that they've you know

419
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,279
evolved over these you know hundreds of

420
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,000
maybe even thousands of years to to sort

421
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,158
of recognize where they are and be in

422
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,038
certain um environmental parameters you

423
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,120
mentioned a few times that you know

424
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:16,440
these lines can be more sensitive to the

425
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,439
environments that they grow in do you

426
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,240
have any tips on how to grow any of

427
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,440
these old world strains because I think

428
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,159
a lot of the advice you hear online is

429
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,440
that a lot of the equatorial for example

430
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:29,679
they really want a more mild nutrient

431
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,798
profile so I'd love to hear what's your

432
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
style do you just use soil and let it go

433
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:36,480
or do you like water in teas and

434
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,480
nutrients what's your

435
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,640
approach um on my land race I found that

436
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,720
they don't really

437
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,280
require uh much

438
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,038
fertilizer um I usually use a

439
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:54,000
mild maybe one or two times of a bloom

440
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:58,480
and I don't I don't normally use any uh

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,359
nitrogen very very small amount across

442
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,200
uh I would maybe use a little bit but uh

443
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,839
I haven't been the last uh quite a few

444
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,880
years I don't really use much fertilizer

445
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:13,319
I've never been a heavy fertilizer

446
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:16,480
person and um yeah they uh I even had a

447
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,200
really weak uh soil mixture one year and

448
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,519
um I can't remember what strain I was

449
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,080
growing but uh it burned the leaves like

450
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,079
I had given it a big blast of uh

451
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,798
nitrogen I looked at it and I went wow I

452
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,918
couldn't believe that and I watered it

453
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:33,000
through and then just uh it didn't uh

454
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:35,400
feed it anymore and it snapped out of it

455
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,720
but it just really burned it heavily it

456
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:43,120
didn't want that I mean they're growing

457
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,640
with uh really uh a lot of the soil is

458
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:48,479
poor

459
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,038
uh you know Rocky you know different

460
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,079
soils and they they've evolved to

461
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,279
extract what they need out of the soil

462
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,158
so yeah I

463
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,359
mean they'll tell you what they need

464
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,320
need just get in tune with the

465
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,639
plant yeah I love that they they yeah

466
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,439
into that more mild just see how it goes

467
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,120
and that all makes sense as you said cuz

468
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,000
you know historically they weren't grown

469
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,319
in you know like modern cannabis medium

470
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,919
just to quickly jump back to the

471
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,839
Mexicans I remember a while ago I heard

472
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,038
mean jeene talking about the strin

473
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,158
Deloris and I know that you've got some

474
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,158
experience with it could you tell us a

475
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,080
little bit about the backstory of what

476
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,720
you know and how it grows how it

477
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:38,158
flowers um I grew a little bit of that

478
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,839
uh the Dolores is an old uh strain from

479
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,520
the 50s and beatnicks brought it into

480
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:48,359
big sir that's the story that I got and

481
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:53,839
uh it's

482
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:57,038
a real uh it's a it's a rare one um I

483
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,599
grew uh three plants

484
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,759
uh

485
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:06,918
last year and just to grow it out a

486
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:09,359
little bit and uh two of which were very

487
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:14,000
nice tighter Buds and one was a little

488
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:18,278
more Airy and they had like a

489
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,200
uh uh what is that uh like a

490
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:23,278
spearmint

491
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:28,558
um smell to two of them whereas the

492
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:30,319
other one didn't um yeah Ryan

493
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,960
radio rids had come by and he was

494
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,558
looking at him he had never really

495
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,919
smelled that smell before it was an

496
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,319
unusual

497
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,720
one um yeah they're uh I want to work

498
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,038
with that again I have to do a seed

499
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,558
increase because I don't have a lot of

500
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:47,879
seeds but um I grew some about eight

501
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,839
years ago I got from a friend of mine

502
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,559
that he got in Big Surf from family up

503
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,959
there and theirs was crossed with uh

504
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:58,839
something because it was just a very

505
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,200
indiga dominant and and uh that's all

506
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:04,119
that I could get at the time and then

507
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,000
uh um I found out that Jean had

508
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,719
something he wanted to give me so that

509
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,440
was real nice of

510
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,880
him oh right on there you go okay so it

511
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,919
was related I I just thought maybe it

512
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,799
was coincidental I'd heard him talking

513
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
about it that's cool to hear he passed

514
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:20,879
it on and I think when I spoke to him he

515
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,599
said that he had heard a story that it

516
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,159
might be like half of the Big Sir holy

517
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,319
weed have you got any thoughts on that

518
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,600
at all cuz I know you've got some

519
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:33,038
experience with Big Sir holy weed

520
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:35,918
no I don't think so I there's so

521
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,919
many stories on that I never did ever

522
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,159
meet the guy that bred the Big Sur so

523
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:44,640
it's like uh all the stories about all

524
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,360
these different uh obscure strains and a

525
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,520
lot of stories come out but you have to

526
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,639
really do your homework and then you

527
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:55,720
still might not find out the the real

528
00:23:50,640 --> 00:24:00,840
story but now the story I got was The

529
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:04,480
Big Sir was zakus and uh and

530
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:06,240
agham so yeah okay and and do you have

531
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,200
any like what can you tell us about the

532
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,880
Big Sir holy weed in general or at least

533
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,558
the one you've worked

534
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,120
with

535
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:20,720
um there's two uh different

536
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:23,558
uh um Expressions there's a purple pheno

537
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,679
and then there's a more of a green Pho

538
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:29,119
and uh the purple one's quite a bit

539
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,880
stronger uh

540
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:35,359
not overly powerful but I mean it's you

541
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,559
know not any of this crazy THC

542
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,879
percentage like these guys are doing

543
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:43,440
nowadays but um I don't know I think it

544
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,640
was like 22 or something but plenty

545
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,159
though uh I don't remember I don't think

546
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,759
I ever really tested it for the

547
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,480
different terapin I might have been an

548
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,798
old test from the SC Labs or something

549
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,599
I'd have to look back and see but it's I

550
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,679
haven't been doing much testing these

551
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,558
these years

552
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,960
uh expensive and

553
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,480
uh um I just

554
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:12,000
can't you know I grow maybe I'll grow uh

555
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:14,679
10 different strains or so and I can't

556
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,720
really go I can't really go and test 10

557
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,120
different strains for TPS and I could I

558
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,399
guess but I really don't want to spend

559
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,759
the money on it I mean if it's for

560
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:28,798
particular documentation or for uh

561
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,599
something like that I I would do it but

562
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,639
um I think I'm going to do a few this

563
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,278
next this year here on a couple of them

564
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,159
and I have to I have to look for a lab

565
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:45,119
to use but yeah so they're uh they're

566
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:48,039
uplifting uh pretty good uh lengths of

567
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,639
uh effect couple hours three hours

568
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:54,558
sometimes they can get pretty big they

569
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,559
got good branching nice nice

570
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:00,240
structure uh good size uh

571
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,519
good size

572
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,798
flowers um once in a while you have to

573
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:11,119
stake the branches up because they can

574
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,398
get uh they can break you know not

575
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,038
always

576
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:18,639
but wow that's cool to hear like as in

577
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:20,000
like the stems are thin or like they've

578
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
just got so much weight on them they

579
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,200
can't support it no they're not thin

580
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,640
they just break at the base they get so

581
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,640
heavy uh uh the buds get so heavy and

582
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,840
the branches are huge the the Christmas

583
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,640
tree um symetry and they get out there

584
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:42,519
and um some of them BR break some of

585
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,880
them and I just uh tie them up if I can

586
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:51,038
get them the same day uh or early the

587
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,360
next day and pull them to where the

588
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,558
break goes back up into the main stem

589
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,119
they'll heal you got to pull them up

590
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,158
quite a bit to make them SE them then

591
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:03,519
they'll regrow again um i' I've had

592
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,200
really good luck with that I love it

593
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,000
plant doctor at

594
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,558
work yeah if they're damaged too bad

595
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,319
they've been left on there and I hadn't

596
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:15,000
noticed it for a couple

597
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,639
days uh and they're really wilting real

598
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,079
bad I'll just cut it

599
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,759
off sometimes they make it and sometimes

600
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,278
don't if it's just too far gone like

601
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,679
that I'll just take it off but I

602
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,079
normally don't miss that I can plant

603
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,000
numerous times every day that's cool to

604
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,720
hear I'm glad and and just to take us

605
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,640
back for a second you mentioned that um

606
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,480
you'd heard the Dolores was brought in

607
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,360
by the

608
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,038
beatnicks I had heard that you you've

609
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,398
been living in sort of the Santa Cruz

610
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,319
area during the golden years of cannabis

611
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:49,639
and so I wanted to know did you have any

612
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:52,639
experiences or stories with like any of

613
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,679
like the B crew or like any of the lines

614
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,360
they brought in and just in general what

615
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,120
was it like living on the coast back

616
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:00,879
then any memorable story stories yeah

617
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:04,479
there's a lot of memorable stories there

618
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,000
was a lot of Brotherhood hash coming in

619
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,679
oil hash

620
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,440
oil um I actually found a couple of

621
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,080
seeds in

622
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:18,159
a a hash Patty from the Brotherhood and

623
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:21,798
when I lived in uh Bonnie

624
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,000
dun and uh I grew those out and they

625
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:24,278
were they were so strong I couldn't

626
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,240
smoke them I don't know I don't even

627
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,319
know what kind of where the P came from

628
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,278
Kabul or

629
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:34,038
uh I I don't know I never I never did

630
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:36,000
find out but that Ash was I never I

631
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,960
liked it it was good but it was just too

632
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,839
strong for me no wonder they make cash

633
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,159
and the hash I'm not a real big hash

634
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,038
smoker either it's just I've got asthma

635
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,240
so I I can't really I don't really enjoy

636
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:52,000
getting all hacked out coughing all the

637
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,599
time but um yeah and it uh there was

638
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,159
some lot of good tie came in

639
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,759
uh

640
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:03,720
uh and like I said the hash

641
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:07,558
oil um honey oil was from those

642
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:11,679
guys and um and that that was the time

643
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:15,158
the the 60s and the early uh actually

644
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,080
late 60s early 70s then that was when

645
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,919
the the narit came in one time I don't

646
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,960
know if they brought that in or not but

647
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:27,440

Brotherhood guys uh you know and passing

655

00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,678
wow what what amazing experiences you

661
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,479
have and as like a followup do you

662
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,798
remember when they first started

663
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,720
bringing the indicas in and and did it

664
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,679
change the game immediately or was it

665
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,798
more of a slow progression away from the

666
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,440
sativas as the indicas rolled in I don't

667
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,798
really know when they brought in those

668
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,600
to be honest with

669
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,839
you

670
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:25,839
um they may have brought him

671
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:29,359
uh over to Hawaii to grow because I I

672
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:31,398
know that uh I think the tie was too

673
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,719
long of I'm not I've never grown over

674
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,678
there so I don't know what their seasons

675
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,440
are like I know they have three or four

676
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,919
seasons and

677
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,240
um I got a guy that I'm gonna probably

678
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,038
ask talk about it he was involved with

679
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,679
them kind of up there with them I'll

680
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:52,679
have to ask him I've just recently

681
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,519
uh um got to talk with him and I I sent

682
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,840
him some of my swasi

683
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:01,759
burmes Colombian actually he wanted to

684
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:04,918
um smoke some of that I thought he would

685
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,519
like it he's a sativa guy so yeah that's

686
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,799
something I'll ask him and maybe I could

687
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,038
find out for a later discussion or pass

688
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,558
that on to you at

689
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,440
sometime yeah wow that would be great

690
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,359
that would be really awesome but before

691
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,159
we step away on to talking about some

692
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,439
Colombian stuff which I'm really excited

693
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,639
to do I just wanted to quickly ask you

694
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,360
I'm not sure if you're aware but there's

695
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:28,558
this strain in the community called

696
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,398
Super Freak and it's like this mutant

697
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,638
type of plant and a few breeders are

698
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,798
sort of doing their own thing with it

699
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:37,599
but that plant originally comes from a

700
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:40,240
pack of coastal seeds it's from um the

701
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:43,519
banana o cross Big Sir holy weed that

702
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,960
bam did and so I wanted to ask you does

703
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,359
it feel like did you were you aware of

704
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,399
that and and also you know does it feel

705
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:52,519
cool knowing that like your company and

706
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,158
the people are part of it help produce

707
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,200
something that's not just like a

708
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:58,639
memorable strain that lives on in Clone

709
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,720
form but like something that's actually

710
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:03,759
gone on to pave its own sort of breeding

711
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,639
progression and breeding projects in and

712
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,879
of itself how were you aware of that and

713
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:11,119
how does that

714
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:16,000
feel I was not aware of that no

715
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:18,359
um I remember uh friend of bams uh was

716
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,720
doing the believe the banana

717
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,839
OG and

718
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,639
uh yeah no I wasn't aware of that I'm

719
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,918
not in touch

720
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:30,558
with with that guy and I haven't talked

721
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,000
with bam in a while but we didn't I mean

722
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:36,558
when we talk I haven't talked about

723
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,960
that but uh yeah no that's uh that's

724
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,440
great uh I'd like to find out a little

725
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,278
more about

726
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,159
it yeah it's really what do you know

727
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,558
about it well it's like it's a super

728
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,159
unique plant in terms of the morphology

729
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,000
it looks like a fern from a jungle and

730
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,200
not like a cannabis plant and it's sort

731
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,440
of akin to if you've seen the Australian

732
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,519
bastard cannab photos over the years

733
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,360
where it's just like a plant that

734
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,798
doesn't look anything like cannabis but

735
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,798
it is it's just a mutation but it's

736
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:08,599
obviously there's a lot of breeders out

737
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:10,720
there trying to make hybrids that are

738
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,158
that like smoke really nice but have

739
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,240
this very Incognito sort of look where

740
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,600
you know you can hide it in plain sight

741
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,038
so to speak so I thought like that's

742
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,000
that's like a really cool thing because

743
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:23,879
a lot of breeders you know let's say 50

744
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,480
years from now like we may not have

745
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,760
anything around that from our work we've

746
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,919
done but I suspect that super freak will

747
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,119
still be around cuz it's truly unique so

748
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,440
I just thought that was cool wanted to

749
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:39,359
mention it to you yeah I of remember

750
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,360
there was a large population uh when bam

751
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,359
took me out there to see all that go

752
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,000
growing I'm trying to remember there

753
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,599
might have been some kind

754
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,278
of mutated things there I can't it's

755
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,918
been a long time ago and I

756
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:56,759
wasn't paying much attention to that

757
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,159
particular strain myself but um um I

758
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:00,759
knew knew that it was a it was a good

759
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,440
breeding and it was it had potential and

760
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:05,319
I know they were growing a bunch I don't

761
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,639
know what they really ended up with with

762
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:11,559
that project or if they were still

763
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:15,000
working with it or not um I lost contact

764
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:17,078
with the guy that was growing those well

765
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,358
I want to delve into some Colombian

766
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:20,240
stuff cuz you've done a number of

767
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:21,838
crosses with it but before we go there I

768
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,479
want to quickly ask you cuz I'm sure a

769
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:27,159
lot of people are wondering what is it

770
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,240
about the old school strains that keep

771
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,679
you coming back and you keep working

772
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,078
with them is it the case that they have

773
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,559
something more to offer than what the

774
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,960
new school has or is it the case that

775
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,559
the new school is missing something that

776
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,800
you're looking

777
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:48,639
for um probably a little bit of each um

778
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,720
the old school stuff uh doesn't uh have

779
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,480
the real

780
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:58,878
high THC like a lot of the new flavors

781
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,878
of the month have

782
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:07,400
um and uh I think the tpine profile are

783
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:10,880
very unique in the old uh land race

784
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,480
lines or or even the heirloom lines and

785
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,480
I think that uh that they're in time

786
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,960
they're going to find a lot of cures

787
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,480
coming from Pure land race

788
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,480
lines um hopefully I'll be able to see

789
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:29,039
some of them um and I'm uh I'm looking

790
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,320
into different tpin I kind of put it on

791
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,920
the Wayside but I'm looking into

792
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,640
different uh tpin right now that uh I'd

793
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,800
like to uh braed for and

794
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:45,039
Encompass that are cancer Fighters they

795
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,599
fight tumors and and uh that's that's

796
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:52,559
something that I'm hope to finish up

797
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,119
here and or finish my research anyway in

798
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,639
another year or

799
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:00,400
so um yeah so you know the

800
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,559
the you know the all the places where

801
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,720
the land race is most of them they all

802
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:08,199
want our stuff and then people like me I

803
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:10,519
want their stuff because it's not

804
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:14,000
polluted then I can work with those pure

805
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:16,880
lines and you know I mean they're

806
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,358
they're really unique I mean I mean if

807
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,838
you never grown them before

808
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,400
they're they're not going to they're not

809
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,318
uh you got to read that plan I mean the

810
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:30,318
plan is it acts different like I said

811
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:33,759
they don't really require much except uh

812
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:36,920
you know I I use uh I have a filter out

813
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,319
back and and it's uh takes care of the

814
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,920
chlorine and the

815
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:43,239
chloramine I eliminate that and that's

816
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,000
just that's the water that I

817
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,318
use

818
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,119
um and I've

819
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:53,920
got plants with it and they seem to

820
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,599
tolerate it but I don't it kills off a

821
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,240
lot of the good bacteria and stuff so I

822
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,640
don't I don't I don't use regular water

823
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,118
on my

824
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,920
plants did I cover that all right or

825
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,880
what yeah no that's brilliant okay so

826
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,639
they're a bit more sensitive to sort of

827
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,838
those more minute factors that come into

828
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,519
play I would love to to follow up you

829
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,799
know you mentioned these cancer fighting

830
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,920
strains and I think a lot of people

831
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,640
would be interested in that do you think

832
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,240
that it comes down to the uh cannaboid

833
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,598
profile the the tpin or is it just sort

834
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:27,279
of a holistic mixture of all of the

835
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,039
above

836
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,119
um I don't I'm not 100% sure but I I

837
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:34,400
would think that it would be a a

838
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,160
combination of all the

839
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,960
above

840
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,559
um I mean they've evolved over the

841
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,838
hundreds of years or long longer

842
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:47,440
thousands of years some of them and uh

843
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,358
you know like a lot of the hash trins

844
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,480
they just Brad them for making hash and

845
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:54,519
whatever they requirements they were

846
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,679
looking for they read for that however

847
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:58,679
they did that I don't really know I

848
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:02,118
haven't done any research on Old hash

849
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:06,559
breeding but

850
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:07,838
um yeah it's uh they have a lot of of

851
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:12,920
things that they've

852
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:15,199
acquired in their genan pool that uh

853
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,358
you're normally not going to find in

854
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,838
some of the newer strains I'm not saying

855
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:22,440
that the new strains may not have it but

856
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:25,519
most are probably won't I might be

857
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,400
overthinking that but that's just my

858
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,318
opinion

859
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,920
sure look that's a sentiment we've heard

860
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:32,440
expressed by other guests so I don't

861
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,400
think you're going too much out on a

862
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,240
limb saying that and just to quickly

863
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,318
divert for a second cuz on a personal

864
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,078
level I wanted to ask you this like you

865
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:44,039
were referencing how it's getting harder

866
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:46,560
to find the the Pure Stock how is it

867
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:48,759
that you go about finding new stock or

868
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,759
leads on new stock so like if for

869
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,240
example someone messages you and says

870
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,800
hey you know I've got some Tai or some

871
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,318
Colombian from the '90s do you find that

872
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,800
you have to approach approach that with

873
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:02,800
sort of a an element of Suspicion or do

874
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,440
you find that most of the time it it

875
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,519
pans out to be pretty

876
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:14,079
reliable um I don't approach it as with

877
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:16,480
suspicion but I do talk to him and uh um

878
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,720
you know ask questions and this and that

879
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,358
and then if I have anyone that I

880
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:26,480
can um reference in regards to them to

881
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:30,920
ask questions I would but uh I've been a

882
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:34,559
roed quite a number of times and from

883
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:38,039
Thailand a new friend in Mexico now I

884
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:41,159
met a couple years ago from snow high

885
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,480
and uh I gave him some seeds he came up

886
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,639
here and we met him and his wife and had

887
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:51,039
a nice chat and

888
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:54,799
uh and uh well I've got a one friend in

889
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:58,440
France um that I get my swasi

890
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,839
from um he just recently uh sent me some

891
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,519
F5s of the swasi that he's been working

892
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:08,358
with it's an old line from uh swasi line

893
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,960
from afro Pips I've been growing that

894
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:13,880
swasi

895
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:18,079
for eight years at least the

896
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,920
f2s and uh anxious to try the F5s I'm

897
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,839
going to put a little dusting on it with

898
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,559
something I'm not sure yet yeah this is

899
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,199
the first year I've uh I haven't uh I

900
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,920
don't really I'm kind of winging it I

901
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:33,239
don't know what I'm really doing as far

902
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,318
as in life for my

903
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,959
breeding H you know so it's just uh I've

904
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:40,559
got some things started I have some more

905
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,358
that I'm going to start we could talk

906
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,960
about it a little later but I got a I

907
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:48,639
can give you a list on what I'm doing

908
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,838
but yeah so I'm uh had small things that

909
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:54,559
I hadn't grown I BR them and hadn't

910
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:59,239
grown them like the N Columbian I BR

911
00:40:54,559 --> 00:41:02,039
that uh four years ago along with the

912
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:06,039
zakas Columbia and I had isolated some

913
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:09,679
purple penos and some green

914
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:14,000
beos and crossed them with

915
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:17,039
my Colombian red that I use um it's my

916
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,039
best Colombian that I

917
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,318
have uh you keep you keep teasing us we

918
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,358
we're going to get to the Colombian but

919
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,199
I'm worried we're going to go down a

920
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,799
rabbit hole so I got to bang out some of

921
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,000
these peripheral question

922
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,400
I I wanted to ask you because you you

923
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,838
just referenced Thailand in the prior

924
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,838
question and you know obviously in the

925
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,358
past sort of 6 to 12 months they've

926
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,559
they've opened the floodgates of

927
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,519
legalization and from my point of view

928
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,920
seems a a bit you know I hope people

929
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:47,599
don't mind me saying it seems very much

930
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,838
like it's the wild west over there and

931
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,760
I've spoken to some Aussies who have

932
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,799
gone over there to try to do things and

933
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,000
they very much describe it as the wild

934
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,200
west I'd be interested to hear your

935
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,880
thoughts thoughts on if you have any

936
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,639
feelings on the way things are rolling

937
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,480
out in Thailand and if you suspect it

938
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:07,759
may be better or worse for the overall

939
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,039
preservation of Thai varieties because

940
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,359
from what I can see seems like they're

941
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:14,679
growing a a lot of you know American

942
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:17,119
Cookies style stuff how do you think

943
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:19,199
that'll play out long term for the tyer

944
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,119
idols well it's going to be a problem

945
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:24,480
it's already a problem it's going crazy

946
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,680
over there um I I have a good couple

947
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,119
good sources over there for Pure lines

948
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:34,519
and they go away from uh the big

949
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:36,720
touristy places and they've met uh a lot

950
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:39,318
of the locals they live over there and

951
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:42,759
they met a lot of the locals that are

952
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:43,920
still underground and they keep those uh

953
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,599
pure

954
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,480
lines and um yeah my friend told me the

955
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,240
same thing they're old cookie cookie

956
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,960
boys over

957
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,159
there there's all kinds of new strains

958
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,199
over there and that's what they want

959
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,960
they want that he went into some of the

960
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,639
dispensaries I don't know about all of

961
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,720
them but some of them there's no land

962
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:10,440
race in there they're

963
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:12,558
just uh OG or whatever whatever they

964
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,000
wanted had somebody send them over bring

965
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,040
them over but I think within U I don't

966
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,639
know it's already

967
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:24,318
getting polluted over there it's just a

968
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:27,039
matter of time before it's going to be

969
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:30,880
just difficult to get pure lines you're

970
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:33,480
going to to get uh with some uh people

971
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,400
that are

972
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,719
preservationists like myself

973
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,440
and um that's not an easy job being a

974
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,799
preservationist a lot of

975
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:49,000
work and um you got to grow those for

976
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:52,640
year years on end and uh eight nine

977
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,239
months or or so some

978
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,799
less and then make your seed and then

979
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:01,159
you have a fresh

980
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,440
batch um yeah so some of that that I

981
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:07,318
grew this last year um I think it's got

982
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,200
potential I was real surprised it wasn't

983
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:13,519
Aira at all it was fairly nice uh nice

984
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:14,799
flowers um I'm still letting them cure

985
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,679
I'm not going to fow with them for

986
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:22,039
another month or two because I noticed

987
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:24,078
that that needed to to get a good cure

988
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:27,558
and I'm looking to I need to do a seed

989
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,880
increase on that

990
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,240
um yeah so I think it's uh going to be

991
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,119
more difficult it's going crazy over

992
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,879
there it is a wild

993
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,280
west um my a couple friends have gone

994
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,119
over there and I think they went over

995
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,480
and acquired some things

996
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:48,000
and yeah it's when you open things up it

997
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:51,280
just uh you never know what's going to

998
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,318
happen certainly I know that I saw I

999
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,519
think it was today in fact I saw that uh

1000
00:44:54,318 --> 00:45:00,759
it the the greenhouse SE official Thai

1001
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,559
coffee shop has opened today so

1002
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,359
unfortunately it looks like Arian and

1003
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:09,119
the crew are probably going to help

1004
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:12,279
speed up that transition by introducing

1005
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,519
Super Silver Haze hybrids to to the tie

1006
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,480
Market but uh you know on to something a

1007
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:21,000
bit more promising which is that a lot

1008
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,880
of fans messaged me and wanted me to ask

1009
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,119
you about the Hibiscus tie it had really

1010
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:30,079
grabbed a lot of people's attention I

1011
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:31,599
think using that purple coranto or how

1012
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,960
however you pronounce it I'm I'm I'm

1013
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,240
good at mispronouncing names um it seems

1014
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,199
as if that's really grabbed a lot of

1015
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,239
people's attention so I'd love to hear

1016
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:42,679
from you what can people expect from the

1017
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,598
Hibiscus tie any specific traits they

1018
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:47,519
should be on the lookout for or any

1019
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:51,039
purposes you might recommend it for um

1020
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:53,719
well uh the Hibiscus in itself is a is a

1021
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:56,880
beautiful strain it's a purple

1022
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:59,318
Cento um female

1023
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:04,280
crossed with a Puna butter

1024
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:07,400
mail um Hawaiian heirloom and um that

1025
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,640
was grown uh and it it's still being

1026
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:13,400
grown up in Seattle by Kiona I don't

1027
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:17,719
know if you're familiar with them or not

1028
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:21,200
yeah great crew I sent John uh seeds of

1029
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:24,358
that years ago and it's gorgeous I mean

1030
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,759
talk about bag appeal oh my God it's

1031
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:29,558
beautiful um there's pictures posted

1032
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,079
from them and then I have some on my my

1033
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:35,920
Instagram too you can look at it it's I

1034
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,680
mean it's a it's it's a it's a it's a

1035
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,639
gorgeous flower I mean that's all I can

1036
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,358
say I mean it's just

1037
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:48,118
beautiful and it's got

1038
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:52,239
the um that really nice Colombian

1039
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:54,640
effect um nor where as the tie cross I

1040
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:59,358
did uh let me think how

1041
00:46:54,639 --> 00:47:01,480
many did I did uh one two three four

1042
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:07,358
plants last

1043
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:10,719
year and um actually my initial uh

1044
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:13,239
thought was I didn't particularly like

1045
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:16,838
the breeding the way the structure was

1046
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:19,318
not the the structure the uh the the

1047
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:23,199
structure was fine was the the

1048
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:25,880
buds they uh seemed a little Airy to me

1049
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:30,799
but they smelled good they smelled like

1050
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:33,880
the original hibiscus uh that the the

1051
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,839
that Hawaiian uh

1052
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:41,039
Colombian and uh but then uh it's being

1053
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:45,159
grown out at uh radio

1054
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:47,039
Ridge and I saw some selections out

1055
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:49,440
there that are very promising now I'm

1056
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,960
changed my mind now so I'm going to I I

1057
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,800
didn't

1058
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,119
really wasn't sure if I was going to

1059
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,760
release that or

1060
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,800
not which I have hav yet um now I've

1061
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,400
changed my mind that

1062
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:05,400
uh um we're looking for some uh

1063
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,639
selections of that and I think it's got

1064
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:13,160
some uh good possibilities and

1065
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:15,719
you I was expecting a bud formation like

1066
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:18,879
what I saw at when they grew it up in

1067
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,919
Seattle at Kiona but it wasn't it was

1068
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,680
way more

1069
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,318
Airy um but you know you need a larger

1070
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,399
population I'm limited on what I can do

1071
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:30,838
here can't I live in town so I can't

1072
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:34,079
grow a whole thousand plants I

1073
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:37,719
mean um the most I I can grow I could I

1074
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,519
could do a grow out of 50 maybe that'd

1075
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:42,919
be about it for Me Maybe

1076
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:47,159
75 but I'm pushing it I'd have to keep

1077
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:50,280
them pinched down but anyway so uhh I

1078
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:51,960
need to grow that out again um maybe

1079
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,280
I'll that's something I probably should

1080
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,159
grow out I might as well just get it

1081
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,839
over with and grow it out here

1082
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,039
well they're doing selections out there

1083
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,039
to

1084
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,280
see so uh

1085
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:11,960
yeah that's very promising to hear and

1086
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,920
you mentioned in a prior question and

1087
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,079
sort of touched on it like tangentially

1088
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,159
and this one about um you know making

1089
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,559
seeds and having to do seed increases my

1090
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:23,798
first question is how often do you do

1091
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,839
seed increases on Old lines do you have

1092
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:27,239
a certain time frame where you think

1093
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,599
we've reached that point better do a

1094
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:31,039
seed increase it's going to start to

1095
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:34,920
fall or is it more individualized to

1096
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:39,679
each line than just a specific time

1097
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:42,838
frame um I don't know I've got some I I

1098
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:45,279
mean I've got some that

1099
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:46,838
are gone beyond what I think they need

1100
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,559
to have a seed increase but I only can

1101
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:54,519
do so much uh I don't know every

1102
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,440
uh seven years maybe maybe

1103
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:59,400
sooner

1104
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,318
um something like that they're stored

1105
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,680
properly

1106
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:07,119
um but they're all a little different I

1107
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,598
mean I have the the Hibiscus is uh I

1108
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,920
haven't done a seed increase and that

1109
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:14,960
was bred in uh I believe

1110
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:19,000
2013 uh I may be mistaken but I think

1111
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,400
that's right so they're you know they're

1112
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,400
getting

1113
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,480
older um I still got a good germ I mean

1114
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,920
I I germed a bunch a couple CLE years

1115
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,599
ago and I got like

1116
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,280
95% so they're still they they they need

1117
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:37,720
to

1118
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:40,839
be that's a that's strain that I need to

1119
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:44,639
do a seed increase because it's such a a

1120
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:48,159
beauty um yeah that's that's a I'm

1121
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:48,159
really happy the way that strain came

1122
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:54,118
out yeah lovely lovely and like as a

1123
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,880
followup do you have any tips or

1124
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,200
recommendations for people people trying

1125
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:03,599
to crack old

1126
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:05,399
lines um um not any 100% things but I

1127
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,640
mean I just heard

1128
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,960
a a friend of mine uh was just telling

1129
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:10,960
me that

1130
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,599
he seeds he gets an all aloe vera leap

1131
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,558
and slits it in on the end there and

1132
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,798
opens it up and puts the seeds inside

1133
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,798
and leaves them overnight and then uh

1134
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:27,480
either puts them right in the soil or in

1135
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:29,798
a paper tellw and he's had extremely

1136
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,639
good luck before I've never done that

1137
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:36,480
I've tried

1138
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:40,480
uh uh aloe before and I've tried uh help

1139
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:43,280
and I've tried uh soaking beans and

1140
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,318
dumping the beans out and using the

1141
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,839
yellow water I got a little result on

1142
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:53,279
that um actually that was from a friend

1143
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:56,358
of mine uh classic seeds in Oregon told

1144
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,119
me that he had had good luck with that

1145
00:51:56,358 --> 00:52:02,440
yeah it's I don't know and then um then

1146
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,160
again there's embo rescue which I'm not

1147
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,679
adapt to that I don't know I you

1148
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:11,960
I I I haven't approached any lab because

1149
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:14,440
I haven't Ved them and I really wouldn't

1150
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:19,159
want to just have any

1151
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:21,318
lab uh do a embryo rescue I don't want

1152
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:24,239
to feel I don't want to sound

1153
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:26,440
like I'm weird about it but I mean

1154
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,919
genetics are rare and you know you got

1155
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:31,039
to do your due

1156
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,680
diligence that's all I'll say about it I

1157
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,639
mean but it's on some of them that

1158
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:39,919
they're really rare you could find a a

1159
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:41,400
place that does embryo rescue or marem

1160
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,240
uh

1161
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,639
work um that would be a

1162
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:50,439
way yeah certainly I think we're all

1163
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:52,598
Holding Out for the sort of artificial

1164
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,400
embryo Tech to become more mainstream

1165
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:55,920
and I I think there's definitely some

1166
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,599
truth to what you said you know after

1167
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,639
everything that happened with phos I

1168
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:04,079
think it's only reasonable to have a a

1169
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,798
sort of an element of um you know as you

1170
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,559
said maybe not suspicion but you got to

1171
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:10,759
you know keep in mind that bad things

1172
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,760
have happened in the past so a

1173
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,319
definitely probably one of the most fan

1174
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,799
submitted questions we got when I let

1175
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,519
our patreon supporters know this

1176
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:20,400
interview was coming up was that people

1177
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:22,639
wanted to know how do you go about

1178
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,400
selecting males with the old world and

1179
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:27,440
equatorial lines you tend to work with

1180
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,599
do you have any specific tips do you

1181
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,039
select one male do you use a mixture of

1182
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,599
males and do like a pollen mix how do

1183
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:39,279
you go about doing

1184
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:41,160
it um I've done uh I've used one maale

1185
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,680
and I've used multiple males

1186
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,960
before um actually

1187
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:51,199
the uh Columbian crosses that I did I

1188
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,960
had four males there were two uh conical

1189
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,439
males with branches kind of upright and

1190
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,119
then there were two males with the

1191
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:03,559
traditional uh uh Christmas tree

1192
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:06,200
branching and they both uh had a good

1193
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:11,359
stem rub uh they smelled

1194
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:14,639
good um I had selected uh those out of

1195
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:19,078
about uh 15

1196
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:22,199
males and then um like the tie I had one

1197
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:24,359
male and it was a I did an open

1198
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:26,480
pollination I just let it rip in the

1199
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:29,039
backyard

1200
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,199
and uh I'm I I got so many seeds off

1201
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,639
that I'm just going to do some uh some

1202
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:37,078
very select uh hand pollinations this

1203
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:39,519
year and uh and from now on I'm think

1204
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,839
I'm just going to be doing limited

1205
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,599
releases uh because I've got exess to

1206
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,960
seed on some things

1207
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,680
and um I would like to do some bulk uh

1208
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,159
sales at some point but I haven't

1209
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:55,879
figured out uh where to go about that um

1210
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:58,039
still working on that

1211
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,720
so yeah hand

1212
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:03,440
pollinations

1213
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:07,558
uh um I use uh one

1214
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,000
or I've never used more than four

1215
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:13,160
males the only reason I did that with

1216
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,599
four males that particular Colombian

1217
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:18,519
that I spoke of earlier is

1218
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:22,119
extremely

1219
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:25,719
um uh productive and it's uh it's an

1220
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:31,519
extremely strong breeding tool

1221
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:35,598
um so I I I got a a big uh a large

1222
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:39,559
amount of uh uh germ plasm on that so

1223
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:42,480
getting different uh formales

1224
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:44,559
was likely way to do that that's at the

1225
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,199
time sometimes you when I select them I

1226
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,640
mean you know I look for branching I

1227
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:51,838
look for uh stem rub

1228
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:55,719
bigger um they don't necessarily have to

1229
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:57,960
be big um good structure

1230
00:55:55,719 --> 00:56:03,239
you know just all around

1231
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:06,798
uh healthy uh um plant if you're lucky

1232
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:10,159
enough to get tricomes on it that's a

1233
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:12,759
bonus beautiful stuff there beautiful I

1234
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:15,719
would love to ask you how do you do your

1235
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:19,200
open pollinations we had Tom Hill on the

1236
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:21,118
show not too long ago and he says that

1237
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,759
he doesn't call anything at all he said

1238
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,160
you know even if there's like a male

1239
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,640
that's like ahead of the pack he'll just

1240
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:29,440
he'll just like top it just take the

1241
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,719
head off it col all those pollen sacks

1242
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,599
and just try to keep it so that

1243
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,798
everything still sort of begins dropping

1244
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,280
pollen at the same time he won't even

1245
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,440
col any of their runs and I thought that

1246
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,559
was really cool cuz never really heard

1247
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,880
people discuss how they do it how would

1248
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,760
you describe your open pollinations is

1249
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,480
it similar is there some degree of

1250
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:51,240
selection what's the

1251
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:54,639
process uh yeah it's a that's a real

1252
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:58,399
interesting question because out of runs

1253
00:56:54,639 --> 00:57:04,318
have come not the strain runts but runty

1254
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:07,720
plants or odd uh plants uh can turn out

1255
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:10,480
real unique in different different ways

1256
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:15,798
I normally don't uh keep the males of

1257
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:18,440
those um but um I could see where Tom

1258
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:21,639
would do that just to keep

1259
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:27,400
that uh that genetics

1260
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:29,239
uh um full instead of uh taking out

1261
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:32,240
because you never know I mean that that

1262
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:36,318
run could have something in there a real

1263
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:40,879
special turpine or or uh something in

1264
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:45,440
there that's uh extremely unique and and

1265
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:47,798
um and um evasive I mean maybe maybe

1266
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,920
it's not something you can normally find

1267
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:55,639
you never know it's a plants are these

1268
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:58,519
this weed's a funny plant um I mean i'

1269
00:57:55,639 --> 00:58:01,078
I've looked at some plants and I had to

1270
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:03,719
look at them numerous times I'm going

1271
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:06,200
I'm trying to figure out what it's doing

1272
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:11,000
even as long as I've

1273
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:14,078
grown and uh like a congal years ago I

1274
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,039
the weirdest plant man like it took

1275
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:20,920
forever to flower and uh I couldn't read

1276
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:22,960
it at all it just

1277
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:26,599
was

1278
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,480
nondescript anyway

1279
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:30,680
got off track there but anyway yeah I I

1280
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,400
don't normally breed with

1281
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:37,159
the um runy males but I don't see

1282
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,680
anything wrong with it if you're doing a

1283
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:45,679
a a preservation

1284
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:48,598
uh it's it's uh it's worthwhile doing it

1285
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,879
sure and in general how do you approach

1286
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:52,760
making your crosses is it something

1287
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,358
that's conceptual where you sort of sit

1288
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,880
down and you think about one plant you

1289
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:57,719
think oh this is really going to pair

1290
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,160
well with this other one or is it more

1291
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:02,279
based on feel and intuition and you just

1292
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:04,038
sort of let things happen and then

1293
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,680
whatever starts striking your interest

1294
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:09,240
afterwards you pursue that further

1295
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:12,118
normally I have it uh sort of planned

1296
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:15,798
out on what I'm doing um like I said

1297
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:18,559
earlier this year I don't so um I'm not

1298
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:20,239
sure what I'm going to be

1299
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:24,798
pollinating

1300
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:26,598
um but uh yeah I mean i' I've had a plan

1301
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:29,318
before and then found some males that I

1302
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:31,640
like and and cut the tops off and

1303
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:35,440
brought them in the house and collected

1304
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:39,239
the pollen on a on a dinner plate and

1305
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,639
then um let it dry two or three days and

1306
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:45,838
put it in the freezer and then keep that

1307
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:49,480
pollen for another day or if I decide to

1308
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:52,798
use it uh uh I would still keep it in

1309
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,719
there until I'm ready for it

1310
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:58,559
um and uh you know go from there and

1311
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:02,038
then uh yeah it's just kind of something

1312
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:05,720
can pop up out there and you just kind

1313
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:07,200
of change your mind or or modify your

1314
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:08,078
your thoughts on how you're going to do

1315
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,078
your

1316
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,160
breeding this year is going to be way

1317
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,760
different because I'm going to do I'm

1318
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:17,318
going to try and do uh quite a number of

1319
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,960
hand pollinations but and I have to be

1320
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:21,400
uh be out there with a dead calm day

1321
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,559
I'll tell you because I can't lift those

1322
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,599
big pots somewhere else

1323
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:29,640
but smaller Sumer tents I got a couple

1324
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:32,359
tents but I I'm not I'm not an indoor

1325
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:35,038
guy and I I need somebody to help me set

1326
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:36,639
those things up to to where I could uh

1327
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:39,200
start maybe doing some pollinations

1328
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:41,159
inside or some seed increases yeah I

1329
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,960
just never got into the indoor um it's

1330
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:46,798
got it points but I'm I love growing

1331
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,599
outdoor I mean I if I was trying to do

1332
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:53,079
an indoor I'd be a hack that wouldn't be

1333
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:56,160
any good at

1334
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:58,599
all uh brings up a good question do you

1335
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:00,199
think that it's possible to run some of

1336
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:01,599
the land race stock you work with

1337
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:04,480
indoors or do you think it would just

1338
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:08,359
simply be like two uphill of a battle

1339
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:12,599
yeah no you could do an indoors yeah um

1340
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:16,038
you'd probably uh you just have to watch

1341
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:21,280
it and uh maybe not try and rush it too

1342
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:25,799
much um yeah I did uh let's see what did

1343
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:29,559
I do I did uh let me think which land I

1344
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:33,318
did I did a I don't think I did a well

1345
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:37,240
no I did do I did a uh that I got

1346
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:40,079
from some elderly couple in South Africa

1347
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:40,798
and they work fine in there I didn't

1348
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,359
have

1349
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:47,199
any um I just I don't remember how long

1350
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:50,119
it took it took a while it wasn't 24

1351
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:52,038
weeks or anything like that but um I

1352
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:55,720
just let him go and then

1353
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:58,720
um made my seed and then that was it

1354
01:01:55,719 --> 01:02:00,639
um and that's that's that's one that I

1355
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:05,519
they're getting older I need to do those

1356
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:08,679
again too but uh talking about it yeah

1357
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,909
if you were to see my seed collection

1358
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:13,639
you'd probably [ __ ]

1359
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:15,960
[Laughter]

1360
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:18,920
yourself I don't know I look at it

1361
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:22,480
sometimes and I go oh my God man how do

1362
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,920
you get I can't pass up a good trade or

1363
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,159
if I'm looking for something and I

1364
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:30,119
haven't been to find it and it comes up

1365
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:33,278
I'm going to try and get it and uh yeah

1366
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:34,599
so yeah and uh we could probably talk

1367
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:36,400
about this a little later on the qu

1368
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:39,240
electric I could talk about that now or

1369
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,880
a little later however you want to do it

1370
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:43,519

01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,719
different kaai electrics I got one from

1373
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:53,039
a friend of mine who actually bred it he

1374
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:54,919
had crossed it with uh Afghan number one

1375
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,880
that was my original

1376
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,798

asked him I said hey you don't run

1382
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:18,439

1383
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,599
says I've got

1384

and he saysyou

1388
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:30,920
know I know where the gate is I was

1389
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,519
elect he was an electrician over in

1390

Hawaii anyway he knew all about it and

1391
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:41,199

where my buddy had had his grown and uh

1393
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:49,118
so I've got the KA electric that does

1394
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,920
not have the the Afghan number one in it

1395
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,960
that that I have to do a seed increase

1396
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,400
because I got a small pack but I did do

1397
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:01,358
uh some

1398
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,160

flowers like that and that's might you

1408
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,838
know I mean some of the newer strains

1409

may have it I don't

1410

normally pull with those but um but

1411
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,798
anyway so yeah two of the the two uh Co

1412
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,760
electrics are both equally as good like

1413
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:43,798
I said the one's got The Afghani number

1414
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:48,880
one in and the other one's just a Pure

1415
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:50,880
Line um and uh you get all kinds of

1416
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:54,760
stories about

1417
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:57,000
it and the one I got

1418
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:01,760
was from my

1419
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:05,559
friend um who I've known for or close to

1420
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,880
3540 years he sent his friend over to

1421
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:11,400
Afghanistan another

1422
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:13,960
Surfer Afghanistan and he brought back

1423
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:17,200
seeds and that was the original koi

1424
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:19,838
electric that my friend had I didn't get

1425
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,679
a chance to talk to H me about that

1426
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:26,519
but

1427
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:29,879
um he grew that out and then uh then my

1428
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:33,318
friend got a bunch of these Zan number

1429
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,920
ones and they were even at the time they

1430
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:38,920
were kind of

1431
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:41,000
rare um he crossed the the afan number

1432
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,720
one with Ka

1433
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,159
electric and

1434
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:48,919
that's that's what that one is and then

1435
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:53,639
the other one I didn't get to really ask

1436
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:57,119
him about that I'm so distraught about

1437
01:05:53,639 --> 01:06:00,558
him dying am like that I

1438
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:03,559
mean yeah we just it's just like you

1439
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:07,200
know besides that I mean two old guys

1440
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:10,960
get to talk about their times smuggling

1441
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:12,239
and selling slinging bags and strange

1442
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,119
you had in the

1443
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:18,278
60s I don't have I don't I got a handful

1444
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:21,160
of people I talk to about that and none

1445
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:22,599
around anymore or you know they're gone

1446
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:25,798
or or

1447
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:28,318
uh years go I I wouldn't imagine myself

1448
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:30,400
talking on here talking about this stuff

1449
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:35,159
ah you've come out of your shell a bit

1450
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:37,119
that was a real underground private man

1451
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,960
I I guess it must be a big surprise to

1452
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,318
see the way the landscape of the

1453
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,278
Cannabis Community has changed over the

1454
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:45,400
current years do you think it's going to

1455
01:06:43,278 --> 01:06:47,039
continue to evolve and become more and

1456
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,318
more mainstream or do you think to a

1457
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,278
certain extent there's still going to be

1458
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:53,358
like a small group of really hardcore

1459
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:54,880
passionate people and then the majority

1460
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,400
of people are just sort of more in that

1461
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,559
casual

1462
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,358
category um I think it'll progress but I

1463
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,119
think more and more people are becoming

1464
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:06,960
aware of the the land race and of course

1465
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:09,720
you have to be set up to you know grow

1466
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:17,639
that especcially Outdoors if you have a

1467
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:20,358
place and uh it's not uh I think most

1468
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:25,318
uh well I shouldn't say most a lot of

1469
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:27,679
the younger uh Growers want faster

1470
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:31,159
maturing genetics you know because

1471
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:32,519
they're into it for um a different

1472
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:36,440
reason than I

1473
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:38,199
am but uh and I never had a problem with

1474
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,159
it I mean it just it's not something

1475
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:41,960
that uh you know I don't know 10 years

1476
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:45,399
ago I mean I think that one of the

1477
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:48,199
emerald cups nine years ago there wasn't

1478
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,480
many people doing land Race come up to

1479
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:52,439
talk to me at the booth and then as time

1480
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:56,000
went on there's

1481
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:58,920
younger guys coming coming up and asking

1482
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,440
questions so let getting out there

1483
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,599
and um I wrote a couple articles years

1484
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:07,039
ago

1485
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:10,480
and um

1486
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,920
one uh from high time I'm not a High

1487
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,358
Times proponent but they asked me to

1488
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,440
write something I had a friend that was

1489
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:19,719
a one their photographers and I wrote a

1490
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:21,198
land race article in there I think I

1491
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:25,079
don't remember I think it was Burmese

1492
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:27,519
and swazi I think was in there but uh

1493
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:29,278
and then a couple things with uh skunk

1494
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:33,000
Julie that skunk

1495
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:35,279
magazine um but you know I'm hoping

1496
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,759
it'll become more and more uh people

1497
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,480
working with land

1498
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:41,520
race um they'll probably work with land

1499
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:45,919
race crosses

1500
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:49,239
because um that's going to speed them

1501
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:52,039
up kind of hard to say actually you know

1502
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:55,158
you got that uh those guys out there

1503
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:58,519
that uh they're interested in is the

1504
01:08:55,158 --> 01:09:01,519
money and they're driven for that you

1505
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:04,880
know and they want to do as many crops

1506
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:08,239
as they can quicker I want eight

1507
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:12,640
weeks this and that and then there's

1508
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:14,119
people that are not growing for that um

1509
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,920
they're they're looking at it in a

1510
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:21,599
different way they're looking for tpin

1511
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:24,119
they're looking for uh maybe uh you know

1512
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,759
uh you know I don't know different

1513
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:30,798
things sure that you don't really

1514
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:33,640
normally get on hybrids or the newer

1515
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:36,238
versions so it's kind of hard to say

1516
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,640
you'll be able to find out after I'm

1517
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,399
long

1518
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:44,079
gone uh look hopefully you're still with

1519
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:46,960
us for a long time I wanted to ask you

1520
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:49,318
you mentioned it a question or two ago

1521
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,560
that you had some experience with the

1522
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:54,199
the Congo and I know that there is that

1523
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,039
Santa Cruz red Congo are you familiar

1524
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:58,039
with that one specifically have you had

1525
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:59,359
any chances to grow it or was that the

1526
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:01,238
one you were referencing in the earlier

1527
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,920
question or was it just a general Congo

1528
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:07,559
seed line you

1529
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:12,719
had no that's that's a another guy I no

1530
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:15,480
I I don't have that uh the red Congo is

1531
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,880
across I don't I don't really uh know

1532
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:21,678
for sure that's that's not what I'm

1533
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:25,760
growing I I actually The Congos that I'm

1534
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:28,440
growing um one of which which I got from

1535
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,760
somebody at the emerald cup and there

1536
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:32,519
was no name or anything but I do

1537
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,280
remember that I don't remember who the

1538
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,719
guy was and I was so disappointed and

1539
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,920
they've been sitting back there and and

1540
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:42,800
I germinated them I got a good germ I've

1541
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,440
had them for six years

1542
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:50,640
probably

1543
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:53,079
um I'm not sure it's purple green red I

1544
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,760
don't know what Congo but I figured I'd

1545
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:57,960
uh

1546
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:00,679
uh grow them out I was really

1547
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,359
disappointed usually I uh I make a

1548
01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:03,520
little paper and write it in there but

1549
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:05,839
it was so

1550
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:10,040
busy a couple of those times at the

1551
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:14,119
booths uh I didn't have time to do it um

1552
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:17,238
real hectic doing a booth at the emerald

1553
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:19,198
cup yeah I know that the one or two

1554
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:21,439
times I swung by the booth when you were

1555
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:23,879
there it was it was all hands on deck do

1556
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:25,879
you foresee yourself doing any of those

1557
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,400
again in the future or do you feel like

1558
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:32,560
since the uh legalization that the the

1559
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:35,079
vibe at the emerald cup has

1560
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,440
changed um I don't foresee myself doing

1561
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:38,439
it I'd have to have help

1562
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:44,600
and you got to be licensed now

1563
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,679
and

1564
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:51,600
uh it's I don't

1565
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:53,158
know I've had I think I don't know what

1566
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,079
B thinks about it I don't know if he was

1567
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:58,479
all watch ke about it last time or not

1568
01:11:55,079 --> 01:12:01,719
but I don't know it's changed and

1569
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:04,198
it's um if it would have progressed the

1570
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:07,239
same way I probably would have kept on

1571
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:09,879
doing it if I'd have my my get my same

1572
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:11,879
friend to help me I just gave him the

1573
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,319
money it's an old high school

1574
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:18,079
friend uh not a high school friend but a

1575
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:20,679
friend I've known for 40 years um and

1576
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:22,639
you know and then I could you he'd hand

1577
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:24,920
me the seeds and I give it to the

1578
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:26,359
customer there but

1579
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:30,719
a couple times I was just doing it by

1580
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:32,479
myself and it was Mak it crazy that that

1581
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,359
one last year I think bod had a line

1582
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:37,718
clear out the door he he said he'd never

1583
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:37,719
do it

1584
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:45,158
again I said man you you had the

1585
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,158
following go and clear out the door

1586
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:52,039
man yes I I remember that year in

1587
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:54,039
question it was it was insane yeah yeah

1588
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:56,279
that was good we we both had a real good

1589
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:59,840
year on sales I don't know what he did

1590
01:12:56,279 --> 01:13:02,039
but I I did pretty good yeah that's good

1591
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,600
to hear that was the year when you had

1592
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:10,119
the pakier right um I'm trying to think

1593
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:14,360
what year the last year that was

1594
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:16,359
uh the last year they had the uh Emerald

1595
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:17,920
cup before they changed over whatever

1596
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:20,679
year that

1597
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,800
was um four years ago or something three

1598
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:28,039
years ago might have been yeah 27

1599
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:31,800
maybe yeah yeah whatever that year was

1600
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:34,880
that was the last time I went and I

1601
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:37,279
think a couple people went the following

1602
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,679
year or two

1603
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:42,238
and and then you know it's well you're

1604
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:45,480
kind of limited I don't know you you I

1605
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:48,759
mean I'd maybe go there to look around

1606
01:13:45,479 --> 01:13:52,799
maybe um and see what people are

1607
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:55,079
offering yeah I'd probably do that sure

1608
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,960
sure look I wanted to ask you cuz you

1609
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:59,000
mentioned you know talking about seeds

1610
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,679
in your collection a question or two ago

1611
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,238
and I love to ask all breeders

1612
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:04,840
especially those with like the really

1613
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:07,198
cool old world strains what are the

1614
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:10,440
seeds in your stash that you're most

1615
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:12,319
excited to pop and as a followup what

1616
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:14,279
are some of the seeds in your stash

1617
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:15,880
where they're really rare and that you

1618
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:18,439
know they're probably so old they won't

1619
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:21,600
germinate but like if the technology was

1620
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:24,000
available you would love to get to those

1621
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,760
ones uh

1622
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,158
I've got some really old Colombians that

1623
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:33,039
uh that I tried uh two or three years

1624
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:36,799
ago to

1625
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:41,840
germanate a couple different times and

1626
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:43,440
didn't I've got some uh Lamb's

1627
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,639

1628
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:50,319
um from

1629
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:54,400
Europe that may germinate but it's from

1630
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:58,479
two different uh groups over over

1631
01:14:54,399 --> 01:15:00,279
there um let me think some

1632
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,959
Moroccan

1633
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:05,079
uh you know I should have had my list of

1634
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,158
all my land race I have like a big list

1635
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:09,359
of all my land race and and I'm not

1636
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:12,479
really prepared for that I I honest

1637
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:15,000
there some Lebanese I grew some Lebanese

1638
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,689
few years back and I was thinking of

1639
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,800
maybe doing that again this year

1640
01:15:17,689 --> 01:15:22,960
[Music]

1641
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:26,079
some Lebanese blonde and then some red

1642
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,359
the blond uh had hermy issues the red

1643
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,920
turned out pretty nice

1644
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:33,000
actually

1645
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:36,239
um yeah I don't know I mean I'd have to

1646
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:39,079
I I honestly don't I couldn't even name

1647
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:41,198
uh 20 of the rare ones I I'd have to go

1648
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:44,639
in there and look I've got I don't I

1649
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:47,719
don't really I've got some old afghanis

1650
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:49,119
uh probably some Mexicans there's some

1651
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:51,639
old

1652
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:54,238
Mexicans that's about off the top of my

1653
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:56,279
head I don't know I think I think we're

1654
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:59,039
all very jealous even of those ones you

1655
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:01,238
can remember so some beautiful stuff

1656
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:03,600
there as a quick followup how do you

1657
01:16:01,238 --> 01:16:07,479
store your seeds long

1658
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,840
term uh in the fridge some in and some

1659
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:14,198
out the ones I'm using now I I don't

1660
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:17,039
keep in there but um yeah I I guess the

1661
01:16:14,198 --> 01:16:21,279
best way uh if you're doing longterm is

1662
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:23,920
uh vacuum seal them and put some rice

1663
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,880
maybe or something or

1664
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,279
and then put them in the freezer cuz my

1665
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,560
buddy had some uh he had some

1666
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:34,079
50-year-old seeds that were frozen and

1667
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:38,480
he germinated them I just talked with

1668
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:41,359
him a couple weeks ago I went wow that's

1669
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:43,079
impressive Jesus yeah I can't can't say

1670
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:46,439
I've ever heard of anyone being able to

1671
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:47,439
get 50y old seeds to go that's that's

1672
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:51,238
really really

1673
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:52,479
special yeah he's he's an OG like me so

1674
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:54,479
I don't know he knows something that I

1675
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:57,359
don't I'm going to have to pick his

1676
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:59,439
brain I know a little bit about it but

1677
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:01,759
that's beautiful that's beautiful you

1678
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,960
mentioned bod in the last question I

1679
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,880
wanted to ask you cuz we had one or two

1680
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:09,239
patreon submitters ask the same question

1681
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,440
which was what was your experience with

1682
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:14,678
the American skunk selection what was it

1683
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:16,638
about it that you decided to work with

1684
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:17,440
it and what sort of smells and effects

1685
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:21,639
do you

1686
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:24,000
get that's a real unique one I I wasn't

1687
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:27,000
sure what to expect you think it's going

1688
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,840
to be a big skunky thing but it's it's

1689
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,319
really not it's it's got kind of a weird

1690
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:36,920
gross smell Steve Steve would be the one

1691
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:40,639
to to uh tell you about that but um yeah

1692
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:44,639
and it's it's Unique it's got some that

1693
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:47,359
has hardly any THC it's got some with uh

1694
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:50,119
moderate to semi good

1695
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:54,359
THC High CBD low

1696
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:58,279
CBD uh Bud likes uh the lower CB the

1697
01:17:54,359 --> 01:18:01,238
lower THC CBD High CBD he had a couple

1698
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:05,198
that he picked out um you know I don't

1699
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:06,799
know I just was uh I had talked to him I

1700
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:08,439
asked him hey you want to do a collab

1701
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,119
yeah give this and that and then that

1702
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:15,079
American skunk came up and I said yeah

1703
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:18,439
I'd like to try that so I did and um

1704
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:21,559
that's a real good one that one um uh

1705
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:24,879
I'm going to be hunting some stuff on

1706
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:28,159
that um that needs to be grown out a lot

1707
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:32,039
there's a lot of uh lot of good stuff in

1708
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:33,920
there and uh I think I I think I'm I'm

1709
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:37,719
getting ready to probably grow some of

1710
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,880
those out at Radio Ridge also and uh do

1711
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:41,319
a large

1712
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,000
population beautiful beautiful stuff

1713
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:45,719
you've mentioned radio Bridge a few

1714
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,560
times do you plan that in the future

1715
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:49,639
people might be able to get some of your

1716
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,480
selections in cutting form from them or

1717
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:54,440
is it more just like a a collaboration

1718
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,000
you have to help test some things on a

1719
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:58,638
decent population

1720
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,639
level um well that's what I'm working on

1721
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:05,279
on some clones

1722
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:10,400
now um one of which that regards for is

1723
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:13,960
the uh San Fernando Valley OG cross with

1724
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:16,879
Colombian really nice uh it's uh they

1725
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,679
like it out there they had uh don't

1726
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,880
quote me on the numbers but there was

1727
01:19:18,679 --> 01:19:25,639
like

1728
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:29,639
50 50 cuts and and uh we're down to like

1729
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:31,520
three or four now you know I didn't

1730
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:35,400
select them I mean I saw them after they

1731
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:38,600
were selected uh they're

1732
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:40,879
uh when I first read that um I wanted to

1733
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:44,400
try something that was main more

1734
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:46,159
mainstream to cross with my land race

1735
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:48,198
and then Ryan had originally had bought

1736
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:50,359
brought that out to me and then that's

1737
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:52,519
when he brought out the Irene also and

1738
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:54,679
then there was another one a motor

1739
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,480
breath and the what else was there there

1740
01:19:54,679 --> 01:19:58,440
was uh the

1741
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:00,359
headband yeah the headband that's

1742
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:03,839
another one boy that that was a good

1743
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:07,158
breeding the headband Colombian um but

1744
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,920
anyway yeah so there's uh me doing I'm

1745
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:12,158

uh making selections and then you know

1749
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:21,759
if we find anything really super we'll

1750
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,639
start selling some clones there's

1751

originally from snow high and uh as a

1790

cut and then I got seeds after that Bob

Hill did the selection on that when we

1792
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,840

1796
01:22:21,158 --> 01:22:26,879
forgiving plant doesn't really require

1797
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:28,840
much and it's got I don't have any lab

1798
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:33,600
reports or anything but it's got pretty

1799
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:35,920
high CBD and some CBG in there too I

1800

lot of it um I haven't lately but yeah

1802
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:45,600
it's an old old line I mean I i' uh I'd

1803
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:47,519
like to one day grow out some other

1804
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:51,400
that's pure out of that that it wasn't

1805
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:53,600

did you ever try any memorable Panama

1808
01:22:56,679 --> 01:23:00,119
from when you were a bit younger or is

1809
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:03,199

01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:14,199
much I got a little bit from a friend in

1813
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:14,199
uh uh 71 I think

1814
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:23,520
7071 um you know it was memorable

1815
01:23:17,719 --> 01:23:26,800
Colombian you know like type um

1816
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:30,040
uh nothing really stands out I mean it's

1817
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:32,239
uh Panama Red it was I mean like the

1818
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:34,198
good Colombian in those days like the

1819
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:35,759
Colombian and red I liked in those days

1820
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:37,678
better than the

1821
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,560
gold

1822
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:46,639
um it was more of a

1823
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:47,639
brown brownish gold golden weed versus

1824
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:51,039
the

1825
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:53,800
gold pure gold brown

1826
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:58,119
green um really

1827
01:23:53,800 --> 01:24:00,239

1829
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:05,519

1831
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,760
tourist or it was a rooll like that and

1832
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,920

1833
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:14,039
three or four

1834
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,520
pounds and I said oh let me look at that

1835
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:17,920
and he said Oh no I got the gold I I

1836
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,360
said no I'm not interested in the gold I

1837
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,520
want to look at the red everybody wants

1838
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:24,880
the gold come on man let me look at the

1839
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,639
red so I was looking at it and sticky

1840
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,480
smoked it man forget it I bought them

1841
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:34,520
all I loved it that was the best it was

1842
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:36,839
comparable uh to the Panama Red in a in

1843
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:38,600
a way but it's so long ago I I I don't

1844
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,119
really remember it all that to be honest

1845
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,800
with you I mean there was so many

1846
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:44,279
Mexicans coming through and then those

1847
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,400
like the ones I mentioned earlier they

1848
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:49,840
were really topnotch so as far as

1849
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:51,638
remembering that I honestly don't it was

1850
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,039
that's a long time ago I I don't

1851
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:56,000
remember

1852
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:59,000
I think if I would have had a choice of

1853
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,600
uh the two I'd take my my

1854
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:06,359
Colombian I'm I can still remember I can

1855
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:08,400
still remember the Clum R oh beautiful

1856
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:10,799
stuff and we're just about to get to it

1857
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:13,638
but before we do I want to quickly ask

1858
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:16,800
you take me back to the beginning what

1859
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:20,239
was your first experience with cannabis

1860
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:23,480
um my first experience

1861
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:28,158
was uh right when I got out of the

1862
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:33,439
maybe um in uh

1863
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:37,319
1967 July 67 actually a buddy of mine

1864
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:37,319
and I were going to this bar in

1865
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:41,959
town and uh he says hey I got a joint

1866
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,480
you want to try and I said oh man I've

1867
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,840
been wanting to try some weed I I was

1868
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:49,919
afraid to in the Navy because there was

1869
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:53,119
rats in there and afraid of somebody

1870
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,800
ratting me out and going to the brri I

1871
01:25:53,118 --> 01:25:59,118
didn't I didn't pull with

1872
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:01,119
it um but that was it that was my I

1873
01:25:59,118 --> 01:26:05,880
smoked some Colombian he had the

1874
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:07,559
Colombian red and uh we smoked I don't

1875
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,199
know I smoked I don't know four or five

1876
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,560
hits I got really stoned and it's first

1877
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:13,919
time I got stoned and we went in there

1878
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:19,199
and had some beers

1879
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:21,719
and and that was it that started it off

1880
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:23,638
that's beautiful I I think you know

1881
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:25,920
myself and many others out there can

1882
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:28,239
only wish that their first experience

1883
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:31,118
with cannabis was with a mythical

1884
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:33,118
Colombian did that light the flame

1885
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:34,839
inside of you to pursue it further or

1886
01:26:33,118 --> 01:26:36,639
was it further down the line that you

1887
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,400
were like you know what this cannabis

1888
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:42,079
stuff it's really speaking to me I got

1889
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:46,599
to do this more um no I mean I liked it

1890
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:49,679
right away I didn't start breeding until

1891
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:52,520
uh first time I started breeding was uh

1892
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:55,118
when I was in Bonnie Dune and then there

1893
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:56,800
was a long time frame in there where I

1894
01:26:55,118 --> 01:27:00,839
didn't because I

1895
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:05,320
was uh I had a another job in Woodland

1896
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:07,920
uh a regular job and uh so I had a break

1897
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:10,960
from it for quite a number of years but

1898
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,440
you know when I was at Bonnie Dune I

1899
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:16,000
remember what year that

1900
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:18,319
was two or three I think then I found

1901
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,319
the seeds in the hash and then I had

1902
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:23,559
some I got some Pakistani seed I had

1903
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:26,840
some Mexican

1904
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:28,119
and um trying to think what else no tie

1905
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:32,760
at the

1906
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:37,719
time um yeah that was uh the first time

1907
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:40,639
my breu in bread and then I didn't for a

1908
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:41,960
long time because I I went elsewhere I

1909
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:45,520
had to put it on

1910
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:48,079
hold wow incredible stuff and you know

1911
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,320
was that first cross a success was it

1912
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:52,920
intentional was a sort of preservation

1913
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:57,679
only give me a bit of a rundown I take

1914
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:59,600
that back 1969 is when I first grew 69

1915
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:03,000
yeah not

1916
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,719
72 um no I was intentionally I wanted to

1917
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,639
see what I could do I was kind of

1918
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:11,480
curious didn't know what I was doing I

1919
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:14,560
mean it never grown it before you know

1920
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:16,279
so kind of and I didn't have really

1921
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,840
anybody to really talk to about it

1922
01:28:16,279 --> 01:28:21,319
because you didn't in those days kept

1923
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:23,679
your your business to yourself if you

1924
01:28:21,319 --> 01:28:28,319
were smart

1925
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:32,279
uh uh yeah so I did some reading

1926
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:33,880
and that was it I I got my out of couple

1927
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:36,559
books because I really didn't have

1928
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:38,800
anybody to talk to about it in those

1929
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,560
days I was just going to say you know as

1930
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,039
you referenced there wasn't a ton of

1931
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,760
people openly doing it at that stage

1932
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:46,519
were there any people you looked up to

1933
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,000
at that time or was it just really the

1934
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:51,080
one or two people who wrote the books no

1935
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,960
I didn't really look up to then I was

1936
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:54,679
just you know

1937
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,920
get into it

1938
01:28:54,679 --> 01:28:58,480
and I read some things I don't even

1939
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:02,480
remember what books they were there were

1940
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:04,238
some older books uh just to you know

read it and thought about it and then uh

1989
01:31:13,158 --> 01:31:16,198
if I remember right I couldn't get him

1990
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:19,039

sent it over from Europe if if I

1992

remember

1993
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:24,880
properly um I think at the time they

1994
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:29,000
didn't send seeds over here you couldn't

1995
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:30,960
get them so I had I got a couple packs

1996

looks similar whether it's I never

2001
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,480
really thought about it too much I

2002
01:31:46,279 --> 01:31:50,479
wonder if there's something in there

2003

cross with the uh call me and I need to

2013
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:22,239

2014
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,960
were working with another

2015
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:27,678
Nursery when we were

2016
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,000
licensed and

2017
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:32,520
um that's the only time I saw it and it

2018
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,399
turned out

2019
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:38,560

2020
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:44,679

2021
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:47,199
so but it's it's got a lot of uh uh

2022
01:32:44,679 --> 01:32:49,520
beautiful aspects to

2023
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:51,759
it that's really interesting because I

2024
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,639
noticed it's it's one of the few sort of

2025
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,679
of Inda lines you work with and while

2026
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:59,400
we're on that topic you know I wanted to

2027
01:32:56,679 --> 01:33:01,600
ask you a bit more about one your

2028
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:03,638
thoughts on the various Northern Lights

2029
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,760
lines and as a follow-up can you tell us

2030
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:09,039
a little bit about the nl1 line that you

2031
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,880
and Mr Bob have used over the years I

2032
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,800
know that it comes from classic seeds

2033
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,679
originally but could you give us any

2034
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:18,760
more info on how you got it and what

2035
01:33:14,679 --> 01:33:20,319
sort of traits it is has um I got it

2036
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,600
from uh

2037
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:26,079
classic uh

2038
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:31,199
he got it from a source uh that's when

2039
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:35,920
uh I'm not sure who the person was but

2040
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:39,158
uh it was around a similar year or so

2041
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,960
time frame when he got uh the Romulan

2042
01:33:39,158 --> 01:33:46,039
from Romulan

2043
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:48,439
Joe um and he had got a uh classic got a

2044
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:50,600
hold of me and said hey I I'm running

2045
01:33:48,439 --> 01:33:53,118
low on these Northern Light ones can you

2046
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:58,679
do a seed increase so

2047
01:33:53,118 --> 01:34:02,719
I I made some in the tent and uh there's

2048
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:05,079

2058
01:34:29,079 --> 01:34:34,479
things um sure it's like the Afghan

2059

2061
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:42,559
of the other NL lines or did they never

2062
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:46,279
really leave much of a lasting impact on

2063
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:50,119
you no I I mean I I I've never grown

2064
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:52,238

2065
01:34:50,118 --> 01:34:56,519
cut from a friend of mine

2066
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:59,919
and up north that's supposed to be real

2067
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:02,199
special um everybody likes the nlvs I'm

2068
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:04,639
sure if you did like a huge hunt the nl1

2069
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:07,319
got some good things in there and that's

2070
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:09,039
something that we will be pursuing here

2071
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:12,439
um in the near

2072
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:14,840
future yeah gorgeous stuff and as a

2073
01:35:12,439 --> 01:35:17,000
final one for the Inda questions for the

2074
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:20,079
moment can you tell us anything about

2075
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:22,679
the red Leb that comes by way of bam I

2076
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:25,519
know that you know Coastal did a release

2077
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:28,319
with it do you know much about it not

2078
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:31,440
much the only thing I know and I think

2079
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:35,079
I'm right on this is it came from uh

2080
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:37,799
Howard Marx uh have you heard that yeah

2081
01:35:35,079 --> 01:35:40,000
I had heard that that it was uh came the

2082
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:42,159
seeds came from his collection and were

2083
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
given to friends and it sort of made its

2084
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:47,399
way to us via bam is that what you heard

2085
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,479
yeah I I heard that it came indirectly

2086
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:52,198
from Howard marks what more Providence

2087
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:55,238
could you ask for

2088
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:59,479
yeah exactly yeah an old hash Smuggler

2089
01:35:55,238 --> 01:35:59,479
what the heck I mean how good does that

2090
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:04,400
get I think it's about time we moved on

2091
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:07,279
to the strain everyone's been asking us

2092
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:09,359
to talk about the Colombians and from my

2093
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:11,639
perspective I think Colombians have

2094
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:13,960
really become more popular in the past

2095
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:16,000
recent years especially with the

2096
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:19,480
community having an active discussion

2097
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,279
around how big of a part Colombians

2098
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:24,839
played in the original Inception of

2099
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:27,000
Hayes and that maybe some of the real

2100
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:29,560
special effects Hayes is known for

2101
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,279
actually come via the Colombians before

2102
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,760
we delve into some of your work with the

2103
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,599
Colombians I'd love to ask do you think

2104
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:37,960
that some of the magic that we see in

2105
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:43,000
the original Haze comes from the

2106
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:44,880
Colombians yes BTO Roo I think but I I

2107
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,639
don't know 100%

2108
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:52,039
but I I never talked to the the guy that

2109
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:55,319
read those so I I

2110
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:57,439
don't know but I'm I think so I think

2111
01:36:55,319 --> 01:37:01,039
later on maybe they cross him with some

2112
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:02,839
things but uh I I that's all I'm not

2113
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:06,880
really sure so that's what

2114
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:10,520
I have heard and then I'm sure other

2115
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:13,679
people have heard many different things

2116
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:18,800
so that's I don't know

2117
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:22,239
what's what is the truth and what's the

2118
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:24,960
story yeah sure and have you ever had

2119
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:26,399
like a a decent discussion with the guy

2120
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,719
cuz you're you're saying you you've met

2121
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:32,319
one of the Hayes Brothers is that right

2122
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:33,960
no no that you know there's this thing

2123
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:36,759
about the hay brothers and I'm going to

2124
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:39,800
stick to this there's basically there

2125
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:42,159
were three guys from New York that came

2126
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,760
out here and bought the haze and they

2127
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:47,638
called them the haze brothers that's the

2128
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,920
story I have the guys that grew it down

2129
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:54,880
there I don't know if they were brothers

2130
01:37:49,920 --> 01:38:00,560
or not but I knew one guy that was uh

2131
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:04,239
close to the people that grew it um

2132
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:07,159
Robert um but we never talked about it

2133
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:10,079
we smoked a little of the haze and then

2134
01:38:07,158 --> 01:38:12,960
he smoked one of those joints that uh I

2135
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:16,359
made the hash that came out of the

2136
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,920
hash and uh that was the only experience

2137
01:38:16,359 --> 01:38:20,118
I had we talked a little bit and then

2138
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:23,800
that I never saw him

2139
01:38:20,118 --> 01:38:26,679
again um I I don't really know I

2140
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:28,840
mean uh I'm still trying to find this

2141
01:38:26,679 --> 01:38:34,440
one guy to get to the bottom of it he's

2142
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:37,360
around but he's he's uh hard to find but

2143
01:38:34,439 --> 01:38:41,559
I uh I'm I'm

2144
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:45,000
a I'm a driven guy if I can I

2145
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:47,639
will I did get some uh original Haze

2146
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:51,840
seeds that are fairly

2147
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:53,639
fresh uh but uh I'm in a German at those

2148
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,319
they there's some that are original ones

2149
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:59,319
that are older 30 40 years old then

2150
01:38:56,319 --> 01:39:02,960
there's another batch small amount that

2151
01:38:59,319 --> 01:39:05,519
are you know under 10 years old um they

2152
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:08,359
should be able to germinate and that

2153
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:12,599
that needs to be uh I don't think I mean

2154
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:14,118
you know there's stuff from uh there's

2155
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:15,840
other Hayes out there but I don't I

2156
01:39:14,118 --> 01:39:19,839
don't know if any of those are the real

2157
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:22,520
ones or not but um there might be but

2158
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,920
I'm sure there somebody's got it

2159
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:27,239
sure well why don't you tell us for

2160
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:29,599
people out there including myself who

2161
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:32,000
have never been lucky enough to try pure

2162
01:39:29,599 --> 01:39:34,319
Colombian that was verified how would

2163
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,319
you describe it in terms of the flavor

2164
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:40,319
and the effect the Colombian red is

2165
01:39:37,319 --> 01:39:43,319
really expansive it's got

2166
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:46,238
a a real earthy

2167
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:50,599
taste it's a soaring

2168
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:54,319
high H what else could I say about it

2169
01:39:50,599 --> 01:40:00,520
border line uh see some sparkles maybe

2170
01:39:54,319 --> 01:40:03,880
some colors um it's just a it's a

2171
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:06,760
probably one of the best weeds I

2172
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:08,199
mean good Colombian is there's a lot of

2173
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,719
them out there I mean this I was lucky

2174
01:40:08,198 --> 01:40:12,399
enough to get this I mean there's others

2175
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:15,000
that I'd like to acquire but um maybe

2176
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:17,960
they'll come but that's that's about all

2177
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,639
I could say really it's just a real real

2178
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:25,480
uh great sativa

2179
01:40:21,639 --> 01:40:28,000
strain for the high not going to make

2180
01:40:25,479 --> 01:40:30,559
you fall asleep or any of that that's

2181
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,158
beautiful and how would you describe

2182
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:35,760
some of the traits that your Colombian

2183
01:40:33,158 --> 01:40:37,198
red male imparts cuz I I'm sure we're

2184
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,639
going to discuss a few of them

2185
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:41,638
specifically but in general what sort of

2186
01:40:39,639 --> 01:40:46,920
aspects does it bring to hybrids it's

2187
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:50,480
used in um well um the Colombian carried

2188
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:53,880
over into the sfb a little bit uh

2189
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:55,479
there's some that's more so they you

2190
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,679
could see it in the buds but the buds

2191
01:40:55,479 --> 01:41:00,118
are not Airy by any means this this

2192
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:03,719
Colombian is not an Airy Colombian it's

2193
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:06,158
uh it's a little denser than the swasi

2194
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:08,719
now the new swasi I don't know the F5

2195
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:10,799
that I'm growing up it might it's a

2196
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:15,719
little probably a little denser than the

2197
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:18,960
F2 but the Columbian is uh fairly dense

2198
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:22,079
for a sativa it carries over on a lot of

2199
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:25,520
the crosses the

2200
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:29,840
sfv some of the

2201
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:33,599
selections from the previous grow that I

2202
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:37,440
did had the structure of the Colombian

2203
01:41:33,599 --> 01:41:39,400
but it was dense a little dense whereas

2204
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:43,638
sfb buds would

2205
01:41:39,399 --> 01:41:45,479
be you know chunkier and this and that

2206
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:46,560
um yeah so it carries over it's it's

2207
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:49,479
pretty

2208
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,119
dominant

2209
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:54,839
um I'm going to do some more this year

2210
01:41:52,118 --> 01:41:56,399
probably too so well I'm going to be I

2211
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,560
Can't Get Enough working with that I

2212
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:01,439
love that plant and I made a bunch of

2213
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,920
seeds so I think at some point maybe

2214
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:07,719
I'll release a little bit I I've never

2215
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:10,840
really released it I I actually uh I

2216
01:42:07,719 --> 01:42:13,880
actually uh traded imy

2217
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:16,360
some because he we traded some really

2218
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:19,639
rare stuff that he doesn't normally let

2219
01:42:16,359 --> 01:42:21,359
go um that I can either talk about now

2220
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:24,359
or later

2221
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:27,559
please yeah please fill us in uh there's

2222
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:32,559
one called uh Golden Voice have you ever

2223
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:34,920
heard of that no fill me in rare very

2224
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,840
rare it's

2225
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:39,920
uh it's a tie grown on one of the little

2226
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,920
islands off of

2227
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:45,719
Thailand and this new connection that I

2228
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:49,199
made that I've been talking to knew

2229
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:54,599
exactly um where it came

2230
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:57,479
from cuz he was is doing things over

2231
01:42:54,599 --> 01:43:02,039
there

2232
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:03,678
um it uh some say it could be uh

2233
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:07,599
Cambodian or

2234
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:10,599
Lao but he says no so I've heard

2235
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:10,599
both

2236
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,920
um long flowering I am grow this year

2237
01:43:14,039 --> 01:43:17,319
I'm

2238
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,399
waiting uh some people probably wonder

2239
01:43:17,319 --> 01:43:22,479
why didn't you grow that earlier um I

2240
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:26,039
wanted to wait later to see if I could

2241
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:28,839
maybe get it to even throw

2242
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:31,039
some uh early

2243
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:33,880
flowering uh a little bit just to

2244
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:36,079
pollinate it I don't care if it gets

2245
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:38,279
fully I want the seeds to be fully

2246
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:39,719
matured but I don't care if the the

2247
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:43,118
flower is fully

2248
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:45,880
mature um I I want to just preserve it

2249
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:48,559
and grow that out it's supposedly

2250
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:51,199
extremely strong I got one other friend

2251
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:52,920
that has it I don't know

2252
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:56,839
uh Haim ever let any of that go to

2253
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:59,520
anybody else but they were extremely

2254
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:03,159
expensive and we didn't do any of that

2255
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:06,239
we just did a trade him and I I was I

2256
01:44:03,158 --> 01:44:08,679
would have bought it if I if he said no

2257
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:12,158
I want this for it I would have paid for

2258
01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:16,118
it because I've been looking for it for

2259
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:18,679
30 years probably maybe yeah 30 years

2260
01:44:16,118 --> 01:44:21,839
wow geez how did you hear about it all

2261
01:44:18,679 --> 01:44:26,719
those years ago oh well well it it came

2262
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:30,239
through here briefly in the 70s just one

2263
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:32,840
time when the tis were coming in the UN

2264
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:36,759
ties the tie sticks Buddha

2265
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:37,960
sticks the hand pressed light pressed

2266
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:40,280
blocks of

2267
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:43,079
tie the golden voice came in and it was

2268
01:44:40,279 --> 01:44:45,000
a super special tie I thought at the

2269
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:48,158
time they said it was it's

2270
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,560
tie and uh you know this guy even sent

2271
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:51,439
his brother over there when he was in

2272
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:53,560
the I think he was in the service or

2273
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:55,399
something yeah make sure you go to this

2274
01:44:53,560 --> 01:45:00,000
island and get that Golden Voice get

2275
01:44:55,399 --> 01:45:02,399
those seeds and he did so I'm G to find

2276
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,800
out a little more and I'm going to write

2277
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:08,679
up I'm going to do maybe a little write

2278
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:12,719
up on that particular strain and

2279
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:16,239
maybe post it um because it's so it's

2280
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:18,880
like the Dolores I mean i' I I wish I

2281
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:20,238
would be able to talk to the people that

2282
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,840
brought it in but I mean they're

2283
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:25,000
probably gone by now maybe not I don't

2284
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:27,039
know I'm going to look into that also

2285
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,920
but you know people want to know and

2286
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:32,560
then they get to the point where they're

2287
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:34,359
so old and then if people die or they

2288
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:36,119
get old and they forget like you know

2289
01:45:34,359 --> 01:45:37,719
I'm forgetting stuff I mean you forget

2290
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:40,439
stuff you

2291
01:45:37,719 --> 01:45:42,158
know the story is kind of obscure you

2292
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:44,118
know so you don't know well I heard this

2293
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:47,679
and I heard

2294
01:45:44,118 --> 01:45:49,598
that well you know you can you gota I

2295
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:52,639
mean it's it's nice to pin it down if

2296
01:45:49,599 --> 01:45:55,000
you can yeah wow that's really

2297
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,920
interesting I mean while we're on the

2298
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:59,238
topic of sort of Southeast Asian

2299
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:00,719
varieties one of our listeners wanted to

2300
01:45:59,238 --> 01:46:03,598
ask if you could give us a bit of a

2301
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:06,639
backstory on your Burmese lines that

2302
01:46:03,599 --> 01:46:10,520
went into making the smuggers choice

2303
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:12,400
Burmese um the Burmese I got I actually

2304
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:16,639
got that from

2305
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:18,719
bod um he wasn't really using it and uh

2306
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,039
it turned out to be a great breeding

2307
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:24,679
tool um

2308
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:26,399
it's got tpin off the chart just

2309
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:30,960
different flavors

2310
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:34,198
and and uh and different things and and

2311
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:36,760
uh I think it originally came from uh

2312
01:46:34,198 --> 01:46:39,079
reeferman if I if I remember properly

2313
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:43,320
I'd have to ask buy again I think it was

2314
01:46:39,079 --> 01:46:47,279
one of his uh

2315
01:46:43,319 --> 01:46:51,039
lines it's it's a it's a

2316
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:55,439
beautiful plamp to breed with it can get

2317
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:57,599
a big huge colas big bulky plant and

2318
01:46:55,439 --> 01:47:00,519
then I I I crossed that Smuggler's

2319
01:46:57,599 --> 01:47:03,400
Choice with it which was uh I also got

2320
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:06,360
the Smuggler's Choice from uh classic

2321
01:47:03,399 --> 01:47:09,960
seeds and it was a on

2322
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:11,359
sticks I guess classic got them and uh

2323
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:14,239
he found out later he thought they were

2324
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:16,598
tie sticks but they were from Burma and

2325
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:19,118
uh that's you know it came up with that

2326
01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:20,920
name Smuggler's Choice which is a great

2327
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:22,960
great name I wish I was

2328
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:24,118
I could just crank those things out but

2329
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,960
that's

2330
01:47:24,118 --> 01:47:31,279
a a magnificent name I think

2331
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:34,000
anyway yeah a incredible name cannot

2332
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:36,198
deny it cannot deny that at all what

2333
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,719
sort of uh smells and effects do you get

2334
01:47:36,198 --> 01:47:41,279
out of the Burmese um I got some bubble

2335
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:44,840
gum off it before which I would like to

2336
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:49,079
find again hashy kind of hashy it's a

2337
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:50,639
it's a a real uh you didn't know better

2338
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:54,439
it would be it's uh you know you know

2339
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:56,279
why it the buds are are larger colas

2340
01:47:54,439 --> 01:47:59,879
they're real fairly

2341
01:47:56,279 --> 01:48:03,198
dense um the leaves start off wide and

2342
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:08,319
then they narrow out as uh the plant

2343
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:11,638
matures like like a lot do um whereas

2344
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:13,000
the swazi is skinny right off the bat

2345
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:16,560
the leaves are real

2346
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:21,719
narrow um that's what's so unique about

2347
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:25,679
all these different strains just amazing

2348
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:27,158
um yeah so that's a uh you know that's

2349
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,599
another one that I'd like to put out

2350
01:48:27,158 --> 01:48:30,439
there more I don't know if people I

2351
01:48:28,599 --> 01:48:33,440
never hear back from people so I don't

2352
01:48:30,439 --> 01:48:35,919
know whe if they like it or not um

2353
01:48:33,439 --> 01:48:37,519
that's uh why it's nice if you have

2354
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:41,599
people that can grow it out and actually

2355
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:45,440
give you a smoke report and a grow grow

2356
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:48,679
report and um these are something else

2357
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:52,439
that we're going to grow out at uh Hayes

2358
01:48:48,679 --> 01:48:55,520
Valley Nursery make up to Hayes

2359
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:57,399
Valley yeah right on right on and look

2360
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,760
how about I uh jump to what you

2361
01:48:57,399 --> 01:49:02,839
requested so one of our patreons has

2362
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:05,520
said um I grew some of the American Gun

2363
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:07,480
selection cross Colombian last year and

2364
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:10,560
the turps were really sort of like a

2365
01:49:07,479 --> 01:49:12,638
sweet gas and citrus mixture it's been

2366
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,039
my favorite so far and all my buddies

2367
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:16,599
have agreed have you experienced that

2368
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:18,198
yourself are they the normal sorts of

2369
01:49:16,599 --> 01:49:22,520
flavors you get out of

2370
01:49:18,198 --> 01:49:23,879
it I the ones I grew they had some gas

2371
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:26,159
that's one thing that I kind of liked

2372
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:29,719
out of it because everybody you know

2373
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:31,319
most of the uh people they like the

2374
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:37,560
gas

2375
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:39,238
um um yeah it's a that's a killer collab

2376
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:42,119
man I mean that's really got a lot of

2377
01:49:39,238 --> 01:49:43,839
potential I mean there's going to be you

2378
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:46,399
know if you're wanting like a one to one

2379
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:47,679
or like no you probably I I know there's

2380
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:51,238
going to be I think there was one in

2381
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:53,599
there that basically had uh THC low up

2382
01:49:51,238 --> 01:49:54,319
to where it could be hemp that would be

2383
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:57,960
a

2384
01:49:54,319 --> 01:50:02,238
killer uh strain to work with some hemp

2385
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:04,960
I think yeah oh for sure I'm happy to

2386
01:50:02,238 --> 01:50:07,479
hear that yeah I I mean while we're on

2387
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,960
the topic of gas quickly I wanted to ask

2388
01:50:07,479 --> 01:50:12,079
was it a conscious choice on your part

2389
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:14,239
to breed the Colombian with these gas

2390
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:16,439
heavy strains cuz I noticed you had the

2391
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:18,678
headband you had the sfv you had the

2392
01:50:16,439 --> 01:50:20,598
motor breath do you feel that the

2393
01:50:18,679 --> 01:50:22,679
Colombian just pairs well with these

2394
01:50:20,599 --> 01:50:23,719
sort of chemi gassy strains or was that

2395
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:27,000
just sort of

2396
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:28,599
coincidental um well I I basically I

2397
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,880
don't know if it was a coincidence or

2398
01:50:28,599 --> 01:50:36,079
not but I wanted to do some breeding

2399
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:39,319
with uh some of the newer strains I mean

2400
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:42,639
obviously the headband is not as new as

2401
01:50:39,319 --> 01:50:46,319
some of these runs and all this other

2402
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:50,239
stuff they got out but but uh I wanted

2403
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:51,880
to do a breeding to offer that uh to uh

2404
01:50:50,238 --> 01:50:53,439
more of a

2405
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:56,840
mainstream

2406
01:50:53,439 --> 01:51:01,198
uh uh clientele I guess if you could

2407
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:03,279
call them that um rather than

2408
01:51:01,198 --> 01:51:06,759
just straight

2409
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:10,000
L and uh you know they

2410
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:12,599
they I I was surprised that the gas came

2411
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,039
through there it was real I was hoping

2412
01:51:12,599 --> 01:51:18,599
for it um that was my main thing on the

2413
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:20,960
sfv if I could get the if it could be a

2414
01:51:18,599 --> 01:51:23,880
kind of a tight Colombian bud with the

2415
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:26,359
gas like the sfb boy that would be nice

2416
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:29,880
and I I have some so that worked out the

2417
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:33,319
motor breath um I only had a couple

2418
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:36,000
plants because uh I I didn't have any

2419
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:37,639
room to grow it they're gorgeous huge

2420
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,840
buds beautiful

2421
01:51:37,639 --> 01:51:44,760
buds but not much uh not much smell

2422
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:47,319
those need to be uh looked into more too

2423
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:51,360
because motor breast supposed to be

2424
01:51:47,319 --> 01:51:53,078
pretty strong right yeah yeah yeah I

2425
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:55,519
don't know if people still want that or

2426
01:51:53,078 --> 01:51:57,960
not I have to ask ask around if they do

2427
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:01,480
I'll pursue it otherwise I'm go on to

2428
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:04,560
other things structure was real nice uh

2429
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:07,678
my sfb plant and the headband were

2430
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:13,199
smaller plants I got them later on there

2431
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:17,118
were cuts um I never have uh used the

2432
01:52:13,198 --> 01:52:20,839
Fire OG iy one of my buddies uh yeah he

2433
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:22,920
likes the fire more than uh the ffv I

2434
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:26,000
believe Golden Coast it's a good friend

2435
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:28,078
of mine ah there you go yeah I I look

2436
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,960
I'd heard that the fire was probably the

2437
01:52:28,078 --> 01:52:32,599
most potent um but I think a lot of

2438
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,800
people like the flavor of the sfv yeah I

2439
01:52:32,599 --> 01:52:37,279
think what I had heard was it didn't

2440
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:39,400
really produce all that much I noticed

2441
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:41,078
that the I don't know if it's they're

2442
01:52:39,399 --> 01:52:43,879
the plants are normally that small or

2443
01:52:41,078 --> 01:52:46,279
what but um I don't have any experience

2444
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:49,440
growing any ogs I never that was the

2445
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:51,960
first time I grew those the headband uh

2446
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:54,279
uh first time I smoked that I was with

2447
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:57,239
bam and we were going up to the the

2448
01:52:54,279 --> 01:53:00,359
emerald cup and I just got completely

2449
01:52:57,238 --> 01:53:02,078
ripped on that God I got stoned too

2450
01:53:00,359 --> 01:53:04,639
stoned to be driving really I have to

2451
01:53:02,078 --> 01:53:07,319
say that I had the vice grip on the

2452
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:10,599
steering wheel and I I'm just

2453
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:13,319
concentrating on driving and uh focusing

2454
01:53:10,599 --> 01:53:15,279
on the road and Bam sitting next to me

2455
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:18,759
laughing I go what the [ __ ] you laughing

2456
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:21,639
at oh man you are so

2457
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:23,639
ripped

2458
01:53:21,639 --> 01:53:26,400
yeah so you know I thought well that's

2459
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:30,440
one I mentioned to to Ryan yeah I'd like

2460
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:33,638
to cross that headband Colombians that

2461
01:53:30,439 --> 01:53:37,359
actually turned out really nice too

2462
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:39,520
um yeah those uh you know the back on

2463
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:44,359
that we can skip back into doing some

2464
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:48,480
clones and stuff the American skunk uh

2465
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:51,759
ibiscus taii the Irene

2466
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:51,759
Colombian uh

2467
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:58,000
sfv uh

2468
01:53:55,279 --> 01:53:59,920
anaro I'm going to run all those to see

2469
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:08,279
if we can find some

2470
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:10,000
nice uh top shelf um cuts and U you know

2471
01:54:08,279 --> 01:54:12,800
some a lot of people don't want to pull

2472
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,039
with seeds I mean some like it I love

2473
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:19,719
pulling with them I mean I don't really

2474
01:54:16,039 --> 01:54:24,000
uh I'm not real keen on taking Cuts now

2475
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:28,118
nowadays from elsewhere because of this

2476
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:31,039
uh virus that's going around that's

2477
01:54:28,118 --> 01:54:33,920
everywhere yeah yeah do you have it over

2478
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:36,078
there not as far as I know I think that

2479
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,880
because as far as I know there aren't

2480
01:54:36,078 --> 01:54:39,479
really any American cuting that have

2481
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:42,118
made their way to Australia I think

2482
01:54:39,479 --> 01:54:44,479
we've been able to exclude it but you do

2483
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:46,519
hear reports about apparently seeds can

2484
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:49,000
carry the virus so I mean gosh it might

2485
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:51,159
just be a ticking Time Bomb honestly

2486
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,560
well I mean it's

2487
01:54:51,158 --> 01:54:56,799
uh it's

2488
01:54:53,560 --> 01:55:00,480
uh you don't know I mean I I I from what

2489
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:02,159
I'm read it's a small percent but yeah

2490
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:05,078
that's uh that's a bad

2491
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:08,679
one that you got a lot of bad viruses

2492
01:55:05,078 --> 01:55:11,920
out there yeah and I have to imagine it

2493
01:55:08,679 --> 01:55:13,399
might just get worse you know I mean I I

2494
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,359
don't want to get into any conspiracy

2495
01:55:13,399 --> 01:55:17,679
theories or not but I don't know man

2496
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:20,479
where's all this [ __ ] come from I

2497
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:23,920
remember when I worked uh Alpa seed

2498
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:28,439
research in Woodland uh the tobacco

2499
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:30,199
Mosaic was real uh the the the AL palpa

2500
01:55:28,439 --> 01:55:32,000
plants are real susceptible to that so

2501
01:55:30,198 --> 01:55:34,359
you couldn't nobody that smoked

2502
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,078
cigarettes could go in the my Greenhouse

2503
01:55:34,359 --> 01:55:39,598
where I was doing my

2504
01:55:36,078 --> 01:55:41,519
pollinations and uh you know and then

2505
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:44,039
you know a lot of people smoked out

2506
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:47,239
there the the people that were doing the

2507
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:50,479
vegetable seed a lot of the the hard

2508
01:55:47,238 --> 01:55:52,919
wheat the red wheat TR

2509
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:56,118
barley those guys some of those guys

2510
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:59,239
smoked and if you smoke and you touch

2511
01:55:56,118 --> 01:56:02,920
your plants that to a plant that's

2512
01:55:59,238 --> 01:56:04,799
susceptible it's contaminated boy you're

2513
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:07,078
you know you're it's like there you go

2514
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:10,279
you got it right

2515
01:56:07,078 --> 01:56:11,679
there yeah I had heard that and I and I

2516
01:56:10,279 --> 01:56:13,359
wouldn't and I wouldn't be surprised

2517
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:16,399
that people that smoke cigarettes it's

2518
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:19,639
affecting the weed too yeah yeah I'd

2519
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:21,719
heard of tobacco Mosaic spreading um

2520
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:25,239
from touching and and more importantly

2521
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:27,158
from people um ashing a cigarette into

2522
01:56:25,238 --> 01:56:28,759
I'd heard a story about a guy who would

2523
01:56:27,158 --> 01:56:31,399
walk around his greenhouse and would

2524
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:33,119
just you know Ash the cigarette into the

2525
01:56:31,399 --> 01:56:34,879
pot thinking oh you know it's just it's

2526
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:37,439
whatever but I've heard it can pass

2527
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,480
through that pretty easily yeah there

2528
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:41,479
you go we'll all have to keep our eyes

2529
01:56:39,479 --> 01:56:43,519
on the lookout I just had a few last

2530
01:56:41,479 --> 01:56:45,959
questions before we get into the final

2531
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,960
ones and one thing I wanted to quickly

2532
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:52,239
ask you was you seem to have hit a real

2533
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:54,000
successful formula combining New World

2534
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,399
genetics with old world genetics like

2535
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,760
the ones we've been talking about you

2536
01:56:55,399 --> 01:56:59,479
know some of the ogs with the Colombians

2537
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:01,920
do you think this formula will continue

2538
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:04,039
on can we expect to see some cool

2539
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:06,679
continuations of the old world meets New

2540
01:57:04,039 --> 01:57:11,639
World hopefully

2541
01:57:06,679 --> 01:57:14,800
um um I I wouldn't mind working with

2542
01:57:11,639 --> 01:57:19,159
some um newer

2543
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:21,480
genetics and uh yeah yeah and then the

2544
01:57:19,158 --> 01:57:23,598
one that I have now I'm I'm going to

2545
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:25,479
probably keep working with those and

2546
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:28,760
doing selections with

2547
01:57:25,479 --> 01:57:30,879
those um yeah because it seemed like

2548
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:33,320
they they did well actually the few that

2549
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:36,279
I work worked with one thing is I mean

2550
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:38,279
like the Hibiscus tie I wasn't real keen

2551
01:57:36,279 --> 01:57:40,000
on it I liked the smell and the

2552
01:57:38,279 --> 01:57:42,279
structure was really good the buds were

2553
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,960
a little Airy that's why I mentioned

2554
01:57:42,279 --> 01:57:46,399
earlier I was a little I don't know if

2555
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,840
I'm going to release this I don't

2556
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:51,920
wouldn't really have a real good bag

2557
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:54,760
appeal and then I saw saw uh some of my

2558
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:57,760
gear out at uh hay Valley and I went wow

2559
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:59,239
these look nice I changed my mind well I

2560
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,320
just have to go out there and look for

2561
01:57:59,238 --> 01:58:03,559
them

2562
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:07,238
now certainly certainly I wanted to

2563
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:09,079
quickly ask you the swazi this is one

2564
01:58:07,238 --> 01:58:11,399
where you know you mentioned it earlier

2565
01:58:09,078 --> 01:58:13,799
but we don't hear too much about it I

2566
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:16,319
wanted to know is it similar to the

2567
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:18,560
Durban at all or is it like totally

2568
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:19,880
different it's different than the Durban

2569
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:21,480
that I have

2570
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:22,319
um I have a Durban land race it's not a

2571
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:26,238
Durban

2572
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:29,078
Poison those buds are they're more on

2573
01:58:26,238 --> 01:58:31,078
a uh you know they're a bigger Bud

2574
01:58:29,078 --> 01:58:34,238
they're not like a Burmese bud or

2575
01:58:31,078 --> 01:58:38,679
anything but they're they're bigger than

2576
01:58:34,238 --> 01:58:42,638
uh let's see what would I compare it

2577
01:58:38,679 --> 01:58:45,719
to um I I can't think of what I compare

2578
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:51,000
it to right now but they're not a real

2579
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:53,719
uh um spindly skinny little sativa Bud

2580
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:57,158
they're fairly nice they're not super

2581
01:58:53,719 --> 01:58:59,359
dense but they're

2582
01:58:57,158 --> 01:59:03,000
larger

2583
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:03,000
um and

2584
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:09,319
uh yeah they're

2585
01:59:05,719 --> 01:59:11,679
uh the swasi I'm I'm anxious to try that

2586
01:59:09,319 --> 01:59:13,599
I'm I'm see how they do this year they

2587
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:16,520
look a little different the F5s to the

2588
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:18,920
f2s I still like the f2s and I'm

2589
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:20,840
probably still going to work with them

2590
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:23,239
yes so that yeah the dervan would be a

2591
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:27,800
little denser flower than the

2592
01:59:23,238 --> 01:59:31,598
swasi oh wow the swasi is a real

2593
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:32,960
uplifting wiry daytime smoke I mean I

2594
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:36,239
don't I have a couple hits I mean I

2595
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:38,960
don't do a whole joint anymore I don't

2596
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:41,078
I'm not a heavy smoker but the times

2597
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:44,960
that I do try stuff like that I mean if

2598
01:59:41,078 --> 01:59:47,639
I you know I mean trying to think uh

2599
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,480
snow High gave me some uh a cut here

2600
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:52,480
what was that last couple years ago oh

2601
01:59:49,479 --> 01:59:56,559
that was a talk about smoking too much

2602
01:59:52,479 --> 02:00:01,638
it was a arapal gold cut man that [ __ ]

2603
01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:04,920
was like caffeine man it was too wiry I

2604
02:00:01,639 --> 02:00:07,880
smoke too much that was real wiry this

2605
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:09,480
is not that like like that and then he

2606
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:11,920
had told me he says yeah I can get like

2607
02:00:09,479 --> 02:00:13,799
that it can be it can be overwhelming I

2608
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:15,520
mean if somebody inexperience smokes

2609
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:18,039
that you're going to get the heart rate

2610
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:20,800
and they're going to go what the hell

2611
02:00:18,039 --> 02:00:24,800
man I don't know know about this it's

2612
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:29,279
uncomfortable it's not a pleasant uh

2613
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:30,279
experience um so yeah I mean you know

2614
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:33,679
some of that stuff you have to do

2615
02:00:30,279 --> 02:00:36,319
moderation on it like like anything wow

2616
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:39,000
that is incredible sounding I definitely

2617
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:41,479
want to give that a go myself on a

2618
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,319
similar you know racy uplifting strain I

2619
02:00:41,479 --> 02:00:46,000
noticed that you had breed with the Cali

2620
02:00:44,319 --> 02:00:47,920
Mist can you give us a little bit of

2621
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,039
info about what the female that you bred

2622
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:52,840
with was like in terms of smells and

2623
02:00:50,039 --> 02:00:55,960
effects um you know that's an

2624
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:58,360
interesting uh question that's another

2625
02:00:55,960 --> 02:01:01,118
one that I'm G to be germinating this

2626
02:00:58,359 --> 02:01:04,078
year I sent that off to Hawaii to get

2627
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:07,078
evaluated years ago after I first read

2628
02:01:04,078 --> 02:01:08,679
it and I didn't get any response so I

2629
02:01:07,078 --> 02:01:13,000
kind of put it on

2630
02:01:08,679 --> 02:01:15,800
hold um I didn't get a good report you

2631
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,078
know it if it was good bad I mean yeah

2632
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:20,039
it was good well what about oh oh it's

2633
02:01:18,078 --> 02:01:22,439
been a while and I have you know I had a

2634
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:26,319
chance to blah blah you know it just

2635
02:01:22,439 --> 02:01:30,279
wasn't was what I was expecting so I'm

2636
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:33,479
going to evaluate it myself so I have a

2637
02:01:30,279 --> 02:01:35,719
uh I mean it was such an iconic strain

2638
02:01:33,479 --> 02:01:38,879
that CI

2639
02:01:35,719 --> 02:01:41,840
Mist I did hold some packs

2640
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:44,639
back um yeah I mean you know I'd like to

2641
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:49,039
get more feedback I mean even if someone

2642
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:50,840
grows some of my genetics and well man

2643
02:01:49,039 --> 02:01:53,078
you know I didn't particularly like that

2644
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:56,719
at all oh okay what didn't you like

2645
02:01:53,078 --> 02:01:59,359
about it I'm I'm all good with I like

2646
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:01,639
constructive criticism just makes me

2647
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:03,799
makes me uh think on a you know what I

2648
02:02:01,639 --> 02:02:07,239
need to do to improve it so I don't know

2649
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:10,239
Ian I I uh I'm gonna be growing that too

2650
02:02:07,238 --> 02:02:13,000
that's another one on list we're getting

2651
02:02:10,238 --> 02:02:14,879
a pretty good list going here how was

2652
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,639
about to say we keep adding to it don't

2653
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:19,520
we that's that's cool uh one of the last

2654
02:02:17,639 --> 02:02:22,199
questions before we do our quick final

2655
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,280
five questions to wrap things up what

2656
02:02:22,198 --> 02:02:26,678
are some of your favorite lines you

2657
02:02:24,279 --> 02:02:28,238
offer and more specifically if there was

2658
02:02:26,679 --> 02:02:30,158
a listener out there who thought you

2659
02:02:28,238 --> 02:02:32,198
know what I want to give Coastal seeds a

2660
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:34,719
go but I don't really know what to pick

2661
02:02:32,198 --> 02:02:37,479
what are one or two lines you feel you

2662
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:39,359
could recommend to just about anyone and

2663
02:02:37,479 --> 02:02:41,718
they're going to have a good

2664
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:46,559
experience got quite a few actually

2665
02:02:41,719 --> 02:02:49,480
there's the K of gold tie um that read

2666
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:53,760
that last year Co Electric

2667
02:02:49,479 --> 02:02:58,638
Tai Maui W Irene

2668
02:02:53,760 --> 02:03:02,560
Colombian the zat Neo Tai Big Sir

2669
02:02:58,639 --> 02:03:05,800
Colombian that that's

2670
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:08,560
good um I have quite a few actually

2671
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:12,679
Smuggler's Choice kaai electric cap can

2672
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:15,360
number one um quite a few that I'd

2673
02:03:12,679 --> 02:03:19,039
recommend wow that is a really diverse

2674
02:03:15,359 --> 02:03:21,519
and cool mixture of strains for sure I

2675
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:23,880
think with that we might need to do our

2676
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:27,040
final five quickly so the first question

2677
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:29,480
as we wrap things up what is the single

2678
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:31,359
most memorable experience with cannabis

2679
02:03:29,479 --> 02:03:33,519
you've ever had so it doesn't

2680
02:03:31,359 --> 02:03:35,399
necessarily need to be like the

2681
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:37,400
strongest weed you've ever smoked but

2682
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:39,879
just like something where it really left

2683
02:03:37,399 --> 02:03:40,799
a lasting memorable impact on you for

2684
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:45,920
whatever

2685
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:49,279
reason uh let's see well um tie sticks

2686
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:53,960
of course I mean that's still right in

2687
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:57,639
the in my mind um some Vietnamese that I

2688
02:03:53,960 --> 02:04:00,439
got uh that was uh looked like

2689
02:03:57,639 --> 02:04:02,639
Shake there's no buds there I buddy

2690
02:04:00,439 --> 02:04:05,000
brought me I went over to his house and

2691
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:07,199
I he says oh I got the Vietnamese and I

2692
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,599
said oh let me look at it I go he had a

2693
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:12,479
gallon baggie there and it's just shake

2694
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:15,840
what this man I mean he well they they

2695
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:19,198
took all the seeds out and you're

2696
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:21,840
kidding me God they destroyed it want

2697
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:24,238
that he no no you need to smell it so I

2698
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:27,319
opened it up and smelled it you know I

2699
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:29,118
don't know I mean to me the pungent

2700
02:04:27,319 --> 02:04:33,158
smell was

2701
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:38,439
uh that's a tough one similar

2702
02:04:33,158 --> 02:04:40,479
to Tai any of the uh Asian ones over

2703
02:04:38,439 --> 02:04:43,960
there it was

2704
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:48,319
just problem is it was just that was

2705
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:49,279
1960 what was that eight or nine yeah I

2706
02:04:48,319 --> 02:04:51,599
I mean

2707
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:53,960
that was memorable I mean as far as the

2708
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:57,119
the high was good similar to

2709
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:59,960
Tai uh if you ask me what it tastes like

2710
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:03,319
I it's horrible I can't really remember

2711
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:07,989
is that pathetic can't remember the

2712
02:05:03,319 --> 02:05:09,359
taste it was very memorable though

2713
02:05:07,989 --> 02:05:11,639
[Music]

2714
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:14,880
um what

2715
02:05:11,639 --> 02:05:16,520
else the the

2716
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:20,760
narit

2717
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:24,040
Mexican zakus was real

2718
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:28,000
memorable you know some of the wwan was

2719
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:29,880
memorable oh actually I I grew one uh I

2720
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,840
I grew a Mazar Sharie one year and it

2721
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:34,840
finished in the backyard that was real

2722
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:37,000
memorable I normally can't grow that

2723
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:40,119
because it molds I don't know we just

2724
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,960
had a perfect year it was like 15 years

2725
02:05:40,118 --> 02:05:46,519
ago I just got some more seeds of that

2726
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:50,480
from my friend but I'd sure like to be

2727
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:52,320
able to finish one of those wow U yeah

2728
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:55,319
that's probably those are probably the

2729
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:57,759
memorable ones I guess off the top of my

2730
02:05:55,319 --> 02:05:59,639
head that's incredible and I was going

2731
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:01,960
to say when you said you know you forget

2732
02:05:59,639 --> 02:06:04,000
the the flavor I I I don't think

2733
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:06,639
anyone's going to you know hold you to

2734
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,800
it you have likely forgotten more

2735
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:11,559
cannabis strains than we've ever smoked

2736
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:13,639
so I I think that given the the vast

2737
02:06:11,559 --> 02:06:15,320
longitude of your relationship with

2738
02:06:13,639 --> 02:06:17,800
cannabis no one's going to hold you to

2739
02:06:15,319 --> 02:06:20,960
blame there but on the other end of the

2740
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:23,440
spectrum I would love to ask you what is

2741
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:26,000
a strain that you were really excited to

2742
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:27,359
try maybe your friends had hyped it up

2743
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,559
and then when you finally tried it you

2744
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:32,839
were like oh is that it well I really

2745
02:06:30,559 --> 02:06:34,920
didn't want to try the I mean I I was

2746
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:37,639
given these and they're all popular I

2747
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:39,760
was not impr I'm gonna probably get

2748
02:06:37,639 --> 02:06:41,480
hacked on this for sure but people what

2749
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:43,320
what's wrong with that guy I never I

2750
02:06:41,479 --> 02:06:45,158
didn't really like the runs never

2751
02:06:43,319 --> 02:06:48,799
thought they were didn't do much for me

2752
02:06:45,158 --> 02:06:50,839
at all um cheetah piss a neighbor mind

2753
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:56,239
bred that I like

2754
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:56,239
that um some that I wanted to

2755
02:06:58,559 --> 02:07:05,239
try you got me got me on that

2756
02:07:02,559 --> 02:07:06,480
one I think that's a good answer right

2757
02:07:05,238 --> 02:07:08,279
because it means you've always been

2758
02:07:06,479 --> 02:07:11,839
pretty happy with what you

2759
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:15,639
tried yeah pretty much yeah pretty

2760
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:20,078
much that's great well on to our next

2761
02:07:15,639 --> 02:07:23,000
one if someone had to start company with

2762
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:24,078
one single pack of seeds from Coastal

2763
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,880
what do you think would be a good

2764
02:07:24,078 --> 02:07:28,118
starting point what's something that's

2765
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:29,960
got a lot to offer from a breeding

2766
02:07:28,118 --> 02:07:34,439
perspective boy you're giving me some

2767
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:37,319
toughies man uh probably off the top my

2768
02:07:34,439 --> 02:07:42,598
Colombian probably would be

2769
02:07:37,319 --> 02:07:47,519
one uh let's see what else uh yeah my

2770
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:50,279
Colombian red maybe uh to start a seed

2771
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:53,079
company well I don't know that's a

2772
02:07:50,279 --> 02:07:55,519
that's kind of a that would be a a

2773
02:07:53,078 --> 02:07:58,359
problem for most people I think I don't

2774
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:01,000
know you know you could start a seed

2775
02:07:58,359 --> 02:08:04,000
company with uh it's kind of

2776
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:07,238
a multifaceted question you could start

2777
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:11,479
a seed company with landrace based or

2778
02:08:07,238 --> 02:08:15,638
you could start a seed company with

2779
02:08:11,479 --> 02:08:19,000
your flavors of the month I mean I guess

2780
02:08:15,639 --> 02:08:20,840
it kind of depends on uh

2781
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,639
uh what you're looking for in your

2782
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:25,319
company what do you want to you want to

2783
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:29,440
do what the masses want or do you want

2784
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:33,118
to start a company that's different and

2785
02:08:29,439 --> 02:08:35,598
unique that a lot of people don't have

2786
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:37,598
or you could like I did on a couple of

2787
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:38,840
mine you could do a combo I don't know

2788
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:41,159
that's a tough

2789
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:42,719
one kind of depends on which way you

2790
02:08:41,158 --> 02:08:44,439
want to go I haven't been asked that

2791
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:45,480
question that's a that's a real good one

2792
02:08:44,439 --> 02:08:47,078
I'm going to have to think about that

2793
02:08:45,479 --> 02:08:49,718
later

2794
02:08:47,078 --> 02:08:52,679
on glad we could do it all right on to

2795
02:08:49,719 --> 02:08:55,078
our final question for the interview I

2796
02:08:52,679 --> 02:08:57,880
rock up to your house I've got a time

2797
02:08:55,078 --> 02:09:00,519
machine with me I tell you you can go

2798
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:03,440
anywhere throughout all of time anywhere

2799
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:06,840
around the world presumably to collect

2800
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:08,519
either a clone or some seed stock what

2801
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:11,039
period of time and where are you going

2802
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:13,480
to go and what do you hope to

2803
02:09:11,039 --> 02:09:18,599
collect

2804
02:09:13,479 --> 02:09:21,039
um a few things the maybe some uh of

2805
02:09:18,599 --> 02:09:23,880
that early afghanis where the hash the

2806
02:09:21,039 --> 02:09:26,760
hash came from the Brotherhood

2807
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:28,039
stuff yeah I need to I I mean I don't

2808
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:30,079
even really know where those came from

2809
02:09:28,039 --> 02:09:33,719
if they were coming from uh getting

2810
02:09:30,078 --> 02:09:36,359
anything from Mazar sharei or uh where

2811
02:09:33,719 --> 02:09:38,760
elmond Province

2812
02:09:36,359 --> 02:09:40,598
or I think probably more than likely

2813
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:43,920
wherever the hippie Trail was going

2814
02:09:40,599 --> 02:09:45,719
that's where they went wherever that was

2815
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:49,319
um some

2816
02:09:45,719 --> 02:09:52,559
Tai maybe a really really really really

2817
02:09:49,319 --> 02:09:55,799
rare Indonesian

2818
02:09:52,559 --> 02:09:57,559
strain a I don't know how to how to say

2819
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:59,719
that there's a real rare strain over

2820
02:09:57,559 --> 02:10:02,639
there there's a real strain over there

2821
02:09:59,719 --> 02:10:04,840
that's uh it's very rare and well I mean

2822
02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:07,400
they you don't even want to mention

2823
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:10,520
marijuana over there so it's it's it's

2824
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:14,638
hard to get that would be

2825
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:17,559
one what else oh I mean you know

2826
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:20,960
Lebanese I mean you know uh there's a

2827
02:10:17,559 --> 02:10:24,440
there's a many places I guess the main

2828
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:29,520
main ones probably would be uh probably

2829
02:10:24,439 --> 02:10:31,439
Tha Colombian abgh I guess gorgeous and

2830
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,119
some incredible building blocks there I

2831
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:36,359
think no doubt you're going to have some

2832
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:38,039
success going forward with those I think

2833
02:10:36,359 --> 02:10:40,238
