00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,820
a meet the sponsors

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,800
we work with some incredible sponsors

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,480
who are very proud to be affiliated with

10
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,140
and we want you guys to hear a little

11
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,140
more about them

12
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,780
seeds here now James Bean you've heard

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,399
from him before and you're here again

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,000
but on this episode we're going to hear

15
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,558
a little bit from Matt from Premier Tech

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,238
to talk a little bit about pro-mix

17
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,280
connect your number one mycorrhizal

18
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:06,478
products as well as countless other

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,219
products you're probably familiar with

20
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,679
and might already used such as their

21
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,859
mediums

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,439
likewise we're gonna hear from Kevin of

23
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,739
covert biological systems

24
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,239
an IPM expert in the field and a huge

25
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,219
source of knowledge for any IPM

26
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,000
questions I'm really excited for you

27
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,000
guys to hear this one

28
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,100
I had a lot of fun talking to everyone

29
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,359
and I hope you guys enjoy this as much

30
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,759
as I did

31
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:37,039
so up first we have Matt from Premier

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,040
Tech talking all things chromos connect

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,879
we're gonna jump straight into this one

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,219
[Music]

35
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,140
let's get into it

36
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,000
[Music]

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,579
the thing which I find really

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,920
interesting about Premier Tech and Pro

39
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,319
mix in general is that for years the

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,820
company has been really well known in

41
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,578
the Cannabis Community for providing

42
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,679
really high quality mediums and when I

43
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,019
think pro-mix I think a lot of the the

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,319
media you guys produce most notably that

45
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,120
for a long time came inoculated with

46
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,799
mycorizer what was it that stimulated

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,140
you guys to sort of start looking into

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,900
mycorrhizer and wanting to pursue that

49
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:21,179
pathway a little further

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,680
well like you said we're really well

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,620
known in the industry by the growing

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,360
media you know uh pro-mix HP I wasn't

53
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,520
really developed for cannabis but it

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,239
ended up being like an amazing green

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,099
media to grow the plan uh but we wanted

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,080
to address the market more specifically

57
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,238
so we're looking at our technology which

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,860
is available you know uh and looking at

59
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,439
the plan and the growth cycle and

60
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,360
everything uh how we can contribute you

61
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,639
know and seeing all the product out

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,459
there we felt like we're able to bring a

63
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,500
pro ion product on the market uh that

64
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,400
will have a Gore grow great cannabis you

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,340
know

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,319
yeah a really good answer I'm it sort of

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,300
stimulates me to start thinking all

68
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,339
about mycorrhiza myself and maybe the

69
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,920
best way to sort of discuss this to

70
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,560
start at the beginning which is how do

71
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,219
you guys grow mycorrhiza like what what

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,680
is the process behind doing that

73
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,439
well we have a like a really unique

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,219
process at Premiere first it's all done

75
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,598
in-house with our Technologies but in

76
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,000
the mycorizing industry there's

77
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,560
basically two ways of producing uh

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,139
mycorrhizal fungi

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,939
there's the first one I would say the

80
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,238
most common and I would say the easiest

81
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,818
in the market uh is in Vivo technique so

82
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,120
the mycorrhizal fungi is basically grown

83
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,579
on a full plant that is usually grown

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,140
into an inner medium it could be clay or

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,719
sand for example

86
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,639
uh and then you are risk all that inner

87
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,919
medium the root system of a plan and the

88
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,699
fungi itself and that's constitute the

89
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,798
base

90
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,479
of the mycorized product

91
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,819
but there are certainly a couple of

92
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,560
flaws with that technique uh yes it's

93
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:01,560
the less expensive but at the same time

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,019
it's it's harder to ensure no presence

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,878
of pathogen control the the type of

96
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,099
genetics of mycorrhizae you end up with

97
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,840
the product uh and it's harder to

98
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,340
control also the concentration and the

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,360
quality because you know you're growing

100
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,220
it out out there on a full full plan at

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,280
the beginning like 30 years ago that's

102
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,440
how permitic was doing it uh but with a

103
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,679
lot of years in research we've developed

104
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,600
a technique which is uh in vitro

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,360
technique it's kind of grown on the

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,139
artificial root system of a plan in kind

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,000
of a microarizal micro reactor if I can

108
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,220
call it that way honestly I don't even

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,759
know the process at all because it's a

110
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,199
well-guarded secret in the industry

111
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,639
it requires special type of equipment

112
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,580
you know it's done in the laboratory

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,620
with aseptic condition with the special

114
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,319
type of expertise so yes it's more

115
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,939
expensive but you're able to produce

116
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:59,579
massive amount of mycorrhizae enormous

117
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:02,160
concentration you know and a very high

118
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,379
quality product at the end yeah okay

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,080
that that makes sense I think I had read

120
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,540
a long time ago that

121
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,399
um some types of plants and root systems

122
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,560
will produce mycorrhizae naturally but

123
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,939
but it sort of like takes you years does

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,180
that sound correct

125
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:21,120
uh a plan in itself can I can I grow

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,759
mycoresi by its own the week can grow

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,699
mycoresis because I would have like a

128
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,860
viable spores or a microsal structure in

129
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,139
the soil and when the symbiosis happen

130
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,879
with the root system well the

131
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,680
mycorrhizal fungi are going to develop

132
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,779
itself you know and at some point you

133
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,060
can arrest the mycorrhizae on directly

134
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,679
on the root system of the plant okay

135
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,060
interesting yeah because I guess my

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,259
follow-up question was I was always

137
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,538
wondering

138
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,939
well if you went somewhere that had like

139
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:50,519
really old established mature growth

140
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,899
like say like the Redwood forests in

141
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,299
Humboldt or like you know somewhere with

142
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:56,459
really established growth could you try

143
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,699
to harvest mycorrhizae from that soil or

144
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,379
not really yeah definitely honestly for

145
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,139
example Premier Tech didn't invent

146
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,779
mycoresia or anything my crazy was found

147
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:11,220
in the Woods by digging out some some

148
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:14,299
Roots so when you have very old uh you

149
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,919
know growth operation outdoor

150
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,680
or even in the forest or stuff like that

151
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,599
you can definitely find mycoresis in the

152
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
soil for sure

153
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,240
okay sure but I mean I guess obviously

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,460
it's it's it's pretty variable in terms

155
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,800
of the mycorizer product you guys create

156
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,779
I'm assuming that consistency is

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,180
probably some like one of the benefits

158
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,739
you can sort of Bank on when buying a

159
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,720
high quality microizer product like

160
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,000
pro-mix connect sort of thing

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,280
yeah definitely consistency is a big

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,720
thing uh especially for cannabis grower

163
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,519
you know you're growing a high valuable

164
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,280
plants so you want to be able to have

165
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,740
consistency in each of the batch of the

166
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,839
mycorrhizae that you purchase and we've

167
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,639
just just talked about uh about the

168
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,638
method that we're using to produce that

169
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,819
mycorrhizae and that ensure a very high

170
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,220
quality product each and every time but

171
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,639
not only that you know we're we test

172
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,440
each and every batch uh each time and

173
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,840
for pro-mix connect especially it's a

174
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,538
very small batch so we validate the

175
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,339
number of Iowa spores for each batch uh

176
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:20,159
the the content of heavy metal as well

177
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,679
and also the presence of microbial for

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,539
example so each batch of product that

179
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,699
you can buy out there is really really

180
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:29,339
high quality

181
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:33,419
yeah that's great to hear I mean I was

182
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:35,758
sort of wondering in terms of like the

183
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,859
the viability of a mycorrhizal product

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,699
is there such a thing as like a shelf

185
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,979
life or it's sort of indefinitely stable

186
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,660
uh there's definitely a shelf life

187
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,699
because you know mycorrhizae at the end

188
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,740
of the day is a live microorganism you

189
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,379
know so you have to keep it viable and

190
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,220
alive uh in order to have the benefit

191
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:59,339
out of it uh we we have like a two years

192
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,139
shelf life and assuming like escaping at

193
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,299
the right temperature you know indoor

194
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,418
temperatures and not too hot not too uh

195
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,819
too cold you know uh but yeah I would

196
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,779
say we have a two years uh shelf life

197
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,879
yeah

198
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,978
wow that's really quite good I mean

199
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,959
especially compared to some of the the

200
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,459
other microbial products you get sort of

201
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,318
more bacterially based ones that you

202
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,758
know the Shelf life's quite limited

203
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,560
comparatively

204
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,538
a question I was hoping you may be able

205
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,839
to answer for me is I had read in the

206
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,878
past other mycorrhizal products there

207
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:34,019
can be quite a bit of variation in terms

208
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,639
of what the spores are mixed with or I

209
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,620
think I remember reading one time that

210
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,259
mycorrhizal product I was using was it

211
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,879
had like azomite with the spores or

212
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,038
something or zeolite or something like

213
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,958
that and I guess I was wondering is that

214
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,639
common process and does that affect the

215
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,359
quality of the product the substrate

216
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,919
it's sort of mixed or bound with

217
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,720
uh if I understand the question

218
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,579
correctly you're talking about kind of

219
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,519
the formulation of the product because

220
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,320
the thing is like mycorrhizae it's a

221
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
it's a fungi and you can put it in

222
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,160
different type of carrier depending on

223
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,139
how you want to bring the the fungi to

224
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,639
the plant so it could be like in the

225
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,519
case of Pro mix connect it's a wettable

226
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,939
powder uh but you can it could be

227
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,339
granular form uh zeolite is another

228
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,720
example of carrier that can be used and

229
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,600
there's a lot of different type of

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,339
carrier it could be into into water but

231
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,259
it's a bit more complicated since you

232
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,000
have to keep in low temperature to keep

233
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,338
the viable G but you know you can

234
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,259
formulate the product in different ways

235
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,180
and that's definitely something that

236
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,240
Premier Tech has become expert at

237
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,579
because it's one thing to produce good

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,200
mycorrhizae but you have to keep it

239
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,420
viable until the grower is actually

240
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,940
using your product and formulation so

241
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:47,039
keeping the micro crazy alive on the

242
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,360
carrier that you're choosing is a big

243
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,120
part of it

244
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,740
yeah that that is definitely something I

245
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,379
was hoping we could touch on a bit

246
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,879
because something I had noticed and the

247
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:58,620
reason why I stepped away from that

248
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,659
mycorrhizae product I referenced in the

249
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,100
past was as you mentioned you you

250
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,500
understood perfectly what I was trying

251
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,540
to ask so apologies for forgetting the

252
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,399
word carrier and whatnot but you were

253
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:11,338
right it was a granule sort of base

254
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,259
mycorizer and I found it really hard to

255
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,700
apply it to like the root ball when I

256
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,200
was transplanting for example like it

257
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,660
was it would just fall off like little

258
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,839
grains of rock sort of thing would you

259
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:23,100
sort of guess that the way pro-mix has

260
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,320
made in the sense that it's that

261
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,060
wettable powder and you can really get a

262
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,339
nice coating on the root ball for

263
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,379
example would you sort of guess that

264
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,600
that's probably a better way of applying

265
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,980
it than say the granules I gave up on in

266
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,399
the past

267
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,100
yeah definitely uh you know in granular

268
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,080
forming can work as well the key here in

269
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,240
cannabis and mycorrhizae is to have

270
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,220
proximity between the spores and The

271
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,000
Roots You know that's how the symbiosis

272
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,860
is gonna uh gonna happen uh and that's

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,860
why we developed promise connect as a

274
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,560
wearable pattern it's uh like you just

275
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,240
said uh you have the most proximity with

276
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,458
the route you're able to create like a

277
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,220
coating so like all the spores are

278
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,259
really at the surface of the roots so

279
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,980
that's how you get I would say the

280
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:14,278
fastest establishment and I uh with that

281
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,500
you get the the best benefits out of it

282
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:20,039
yeah okay that makes sense that's good

283
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,559
so in the past I had sometimes added

284
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,439
mycorrhizae to just my water and then

285
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,619
watered it in do you think that that's

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,420
gonna lead to sort of meaningful levels

287
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,039
of the spores getting to the roots or

288
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,778
you really sort of want to do what you

289
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,120
mentioned and have it like proximally

290
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:37,980
just really applied to the root itself

291
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,278
if possible

292
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,339
uh I would say closest to the root is

293
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,679
the best uh you you can you could have

294
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,100
an impact by mixing it with water but

295
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:53,699
clearly it's not efficient enough for

296
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,680
you know first mycorrhizae isn't soluble

297
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,480
so you have to keep like agitation in

298
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,059
your water in order for the microwaves

299
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,060
to stay mixed into your water so so

300
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,679
that's that's first but even that the

301
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,899
spores gonna have to attach itself to

302
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,519
the roots to have really an impact but

303
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,740
probably a lot of them going to be

304
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,139
washed away when you're applying your

305
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,539
water you know so yes it could have an

306
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,240
impact but definitely not as much if you

307
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:21,419
are applying it directly to your roots

308
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,879
okay sure and is there anything people

309
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:28,139
can do that you're aware of that would

310
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:30,480
increase the ability for the the sport

311
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,120
to successfully connect with the route

312
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,579
like maybe like soil temperatures or

313
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,600
like the degree of how wet the medium is

314
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,039
at the time is there anything you're

315
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,040
aware of that could help them get better

316
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:44,519
benefit I would say uh mostly two things

317
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:47,360
uh the Water not being too too hot or

318
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,299
too cold you know tap water is just fine

319
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,039
uh when mixing the powder for example

320
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:56,219
and the second thing would be to maybe

321
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,919
slow down on phosphorus for you know two

322
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,660
weeks after application and it's kind of

323
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,458
renowned out there the phosphorus is not

324
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,139
going to kill the fungi at all it's just

325
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,059
that if you have a lot a big amount of

326
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,820
phosphorus it's going to kind of

327
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:11,039
intubate the establishment of that

328
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,920
symbiosis you know so you want to give

329
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,740
it a chance to those through those two

330
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,360
first two weeks

331
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,278
so I mean this is just sort of a

332
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,220
question that's come to mind but if

333
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:25,078
someone was to use mycorrhizae in a like

334
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,300
a more of like a hydroponic setting

335
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,519
where they're using salt-based nutrients

336
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,859
and they're laid in bloom and they're

337
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,480
applying lots of phosphorus and

338
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,579
potassium and stuff

339
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,839
I guess by virtue of what you just said

340
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:38,338
like you're probably not going to get

341
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,620
that much effect out of applying

342
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,959
mycorrhiza Laden flour in that sort of

343
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,159
situation or it's still beneficial do

344
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,619
you think

345
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,600
well the key anyways not to apply the

346
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,519
product latent flower you know to have

347
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,100
the best benefit out of the mycoresis to

348
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,560
apply it as soon as possible so the goal

349
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,720
we recommend to apply you know when your

350
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,939
clone is rooted that's when you when you

351
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,778
do your first transplant that's one you

352
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,579
want to apply it because you know uh the

353
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:08,519
establishment of the mycorrhizian the

354
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:10,439
symbiosis take some times so the sooner

355
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,299
you do the application the better the

356
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,180
benefits you know you're gonna have at

357
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,578
the end so I don't see the point of

358
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,439
doing it at the end like lay flour when

359
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:21,659
you're gonna are nervous you know a

360
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,480
month from from that point

361
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:27,360
yeah sure that makes a lot of sense so I

362
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,360
mean you touched on earlier how this is

363
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,100
a a high commodity crop it's a lot of

364
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,839
value for people and that's something

365
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm always trying to emphasize to people

366
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,339
especially when people talk about the

367
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,959
economics of products and stuff I'm I

368
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,600
sort of frequently try to remind them

369
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,599
that you know this is such a high value

370
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,399
crop that's sometimes paying for premium

371
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,500
inputs you're going to get a much better

372
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,019
output and I guess in the case of

373
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,639
mycorrhizae there's no discussion in the

374
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,560
community about whether it works just

375
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,659
empirically you can see it works when

376
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,458
you use it it just it's so so night and

377
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,259
day difference but I guess I'm sort of

378
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:04,439
wondering have you guys ever looked into

379
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,360
or sort of tried to quantify at all the

380
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,860
benefit of using mycorrhizae because I

381
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,079
thought if I had to Hazard a guess I'd

382
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,000
say it probably going to get twice as

383
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,500
much growth or something like very

384
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
dramatic increase have you guys ever

385
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,759
looked into that sort of thing

386
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,560
yeah yeah of course uh one of our first

387
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,379
single that we bring to the market is

388
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,239
the return on investment you know and

389
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,740
the way we recommend to apply the

390
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,740
product you know you you're going to

391
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,659
kind of put an investment between one or

392
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,060
three dollar a plan it depends on how

393
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:36,778
much powder or how you mix a product you

394
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:39,719
know uh but you know one or two three

395
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:41,698
dollar a plan it's not much when for

396
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,180
example let's just say not not even a

397
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:47,338
high uh a high yield increase let's just

398
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:49,679
say it's five percent you know five

399
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,040
percent on a big plan it could end up to

400
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,620
be 20 gram you know 20 gram at five ten

401
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,958
dollar a gram your written investment is

402
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,000
pretty pretty easy but not only that

403
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:05,458
we've was really really important for us

404
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,860
to yes the yield yes yield is always

405
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:10,439
important but in cannabis quality is

406
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,480
everything craft cannabis you know I

407
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,060
feel it's a really growing industry and

408
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,959
you know you get top dollars for top

409
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:20,399
flowers and uh by bringing yes the yield

410
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,899
but also the quality you know increase

411
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,000
their opinion increase cannabinoids

412
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,159
you're able to produce consistently

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,278
higher quality flowers and that you're

414
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,838
able to get much more out of a crop even

415
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,338
for example if you don't have any yield

416
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,959
increase you're gonna get better results

417
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,320
as well

418
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,719
yeah okay I mean that opens the door to

419
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,579
sort of discussing when might be the

420
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,759
best time to use things in terms of

421
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:46,739
getting the best return on investment a

422
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,899
lot of people use mycorrhiza as sort of

423
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,060
a root stimulating agent instead of your

424
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,620
traditional cloning gels or powders

425
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,439
things like that

426
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,600
how would you use mycorrhizae would you

427
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,920
say for example use it once when

428
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,019
stimulating the roots and then again

429
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,578
when transplanting what how would you

430
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,140
tell if your friend came up to and said

431
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,338
when should I be using mycorizer give me

432
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,439
the road map

433
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:10,279
well I would just tell you how I

434
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,019
personally use it myself uh you know

435
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,119
most of the Growers are there anyway are

436
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,818
now probably doing only one transplant

437
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:21,359
that's kind of the trend right now and

438
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:23,119
anyway the most important application is

439
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,219
the first one

440
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,019
and in my mind the best one is when you

441
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,179
have a rooted clone that is ready to be

442
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,879
transplanted into a bigger pot because

443
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:36,360
you know you have all those root exposed

444
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,340
and you have to have the contact like I

445
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,379
said before the roots and the spores in

446
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,000
order to get the symbiosis going so I

447
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,220
would say that's really really the key

448
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,079
key moment to apply the product

449
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,400
yeah okay great and I mean this one is

450
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,960
kind of a hard one to answer and that's

451
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,880
why I'm asking you because I wasn't able

452
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,000
to find an answer but I've always been

453
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,660
curious as to how mycorrhiza facilitated

454
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,220
that root stimulating process because

455
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,140
it's very clear based on people's

456
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,140
evidence of just trialing it themselves

457
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,059
that mycorrhizer is a reasonably it's a

458
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,759
pretty down good effective rooting agent

459
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:14,339
but I could never really like figure out

460
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,839
like what was how is it mediating this

461
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,279
process do you have any idea about that

462
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,259
or is that just something we probably

463
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,160
need to research a bit more to figure

464
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:23,519
out

465
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,580
well mycoresce Microsoft fungi basically

466
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,460
need the plant to live that's how it

467
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,019
works you know by having that sense we

468
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,058
also is going with the root system of a

469
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,619
plan and that's how the mycorrhizal

470
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,240
fungi is able to thrive and develop

471
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,159
itself you know create the if Network

472
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,839
that bring the benefit the renowned

473
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,120
benefit of the My Verizon which is

474
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,000
picking up water picking up nutrients

475
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,798
you know uh and in return it's going to

476
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,240
help the plant to thrive because if the

477
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,279
plant Thrive the fungi is going to

478
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,919
thrive as well so if you have more water

479
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:56,399
more nutrient you're gonna be able to

480
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,740
develop bigger root a bigger structure

481
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,080
bigger flower you know and higher

482
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,240
quality it's all linked together so if

483
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,759
if the fungi is doing well well the plan

484
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,579
is going to do well as as well so

485
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,519
okay yeah that's that's a really sort of

486
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:13,879
nice explanation like so you're sort of

487
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,960
thinking that maybe there's like a

488
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,360
chemotaxic sort of process where the

489
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,400
fungi are stimulating the roots to

490
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,579
ensure their own Survival sort of thing

491
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,620
well there's a whole process behind of

492
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,379
it you know I can go deep into each and

493
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:30,538
every step uh you know the spores when

494
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,360
you get into contact with the rules like

495
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:35,160
physically is going to detect where the

496
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,979
roots is in the soil and it's going to

497
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,740
germinate towards it and at some point

498
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,679
it's gonna have a contact between the IV

499
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,380
and The Roots the route in itself it's

500
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,720
going to penetrate the root cells and

501
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,580
create structure inside the roots of the

502
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,259
plant and when those structure like

503
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:54,359
Arbor school and physical are created

504
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,940
inside the root and they are able to

505
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,279
exchange energy and that's how the IP

506
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,259
network then is going to be created and

507
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,178
you know that relationship yes going to

508
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,038
bring more water and more nutrient but

509
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,720
you know you're impacting also the

510
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,640
immune system of a plant you're

511
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,919
basically stimulating the immune system

512
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,380
of the plant so that's kind of also

513
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,600
where dnns of quality can have been

514
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,980
within European compounds like that came

515
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,980
from

516
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,919
yeah wow okay that's that's really good

517
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,839
information to know so with that in mind

518
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,480
how there's more sort of nutrient

519
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,659
availability with the presence of

520
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,720
mycorrhizae would you sort of try to

521
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,759
angle that effect as you could get away

522
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,980
with using less nutrients because it's

523
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,379
more available to the plant or would you

524
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,058
sort of try to pile up on it and be like

525
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,740
well let's actually add more nutrients

526
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:44,839
and try to facilitate even greater

527
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,759
uptake

528
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,339
often I try to stay away from that topic

529
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,319
because you know cannabis Gore are

530
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:55,279
really like personal in terms of using

531
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,659
nutrients you know but for sure you can

532
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,879
slow down on nutrients because you're

533
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,140
going to pick up more but at the end of

534
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,340
the day you can keep the same schedule

535
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,259
and you're going to achieve better

536
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,298
result as well because it's it's gonna

537
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,099
maybe help you achieve better like

538
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,319
become like picking up more nutrient

539
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:11,819
like I said but also like avoid salt

540
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,918
buildup and stuff like that because

541
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:17,159
you're having that much nutrient

542
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,080
presenting to the soul you know so so I

543
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,019
mean the majority of our listeners as

544
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,819
far as I'm aware Are soil based Growers

545
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,558
but you know we like to show some love

546
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,700
to our soilless Growers from time to

547
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:28,619
time

548
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,080
um so I guess my question is

549
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,000
as far as you're aware does mycorrhizal

550
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,599
work equally as effective in sort of

551
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,579
both styles of growing yeah you know um

552
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,319
or am I crazy probably yeah of course

553
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,579
it's probably making it it's worked well

554
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,158
with our growing media but it's

555
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,619
compatible with other type of media you

556
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,740
know uh as long as you have a physical

557
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:51,899
support for the roots and the fungi it

558
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,058
is going to work you know rock wall or

559
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,000
coco where it's just fine directly into

560
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:59,879
Seoul as well of course uh the only

561
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,579
issue I would say is pure Hydroponic and

562
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,740
to be more precise aeropanic because you

563
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:07,259
don't have a physical support to develop

564
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,779
the root and the fungi so I'm not sure

565
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,700
how it would work but in most cases

566
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:14,759
mycorreza is compatible with kind of

567
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,798
every style of growing fantastic and

568
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,140
from what I had read it sort of was

569
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,639
saying that

570
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,740
ectomycorrhiza didn't really provide any

571
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,240
benefit to cannabis does that sound

572
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,960
right to you

573
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,579
yeah no effect at all because it's kind

574
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,880
of just a filler because at the end of

575
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:34,379
the day uh the mycorrhizal fungi is not

576
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,940
going to be able to connect with the

577
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,559
root system because it's just not

578
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,058
compatible so we won't have any effect

579
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:41,759
at all

580
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,678
sure and I mean in the past I'd seen

581
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,819
mycorrhizal products which had sort of

582
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,798
boasted being a blend of you know six 12

583
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,658
different mycorrhizal strains things

584
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:53,639
like that what's your thoughts on that

585
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:57,360
does it provide diversity or is it

586
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,220
filler uh you know that's something that

587
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,038
is really popular in the marketing the

588
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,980
most the better uh but unfortunately for

589
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:07,379
my crisis it's not the case you know

590
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,019
we've did a lot of research at finding

591
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,820
the best strain of the of the best you

592
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:14,099
know genetic of mycoresis out there

593
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:16,500
which is gloomless and tried radices in

594
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:19,319
the pro-mix connect you know by putting

595
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,058
any other uh mycorrhiza in there you're

596
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,099
just introducing competition with the

597
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:26,639
mycorrhizae which doesn't help the

598
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:28,379
strain to thrive you know uh and to put

599
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,299
other microlysis in there you have to

600
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,940
dilute the amount of mycoresis that you

601
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:36,179
put in of your best strain so you know

602
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,759
you just count you know it doesn't work

603
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,320
that way yeah brilliant I'm glad to hear

604
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,259
that from you because that had been my

605
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,678
suspicion for a while I think yeah I had

606
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:48,000
read that yeah the glomerular

607
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,500
subspecies was the sort of doing the

608
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,240
bulk of the work so that's when I

609
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,000
started to wonder you know the the rest

610
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,000
just sort of filler so I mean do you

611
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
suspect that going forward in maybe say

612
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,220
more the long term you'll see companies

613
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,019
all switched to just sort of providing

614
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,460
the one strain that's doing the bulk of

615
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:06,599
the work or do you think there's still

616
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,700
just always going to be a bit of

617
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,678
marketing at Play

618
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,720
uh there's definitely always going to be

619
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,820
some marketing but you we have to keep

620
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,700
in mind that some people are just aren't

621
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:19,798
able to produce a perfectly pure product

622
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,080
you know like I've talked earlier when

623
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,639
you're using like uh nvivo technique of

624
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,038
growing digital on the planet it's hard

625
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,200
to keep control of what is actually

626
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,839
growing on the root system of the plant

627
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,240
so you have probably multiple species of

628
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,099
mycorrhizae in there so I feel like

629
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,620
there's always going to be some product

630
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,740
like that out there and people that are

631
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:42,058
actually able to produce eye

632
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,400
concentration of a specific species

633
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:46,440
specific species is going to go that

634
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,620
route eventually

635
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,500
so with that in mind are you aware of

636
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,019
any other microbes which may sort of

637
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,000
synergize well or just work well in

638
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:58,379
conjunction with mycorrhizae that you're

639
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,279
personally fond of

640
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,080
yeah uh honestly most bacteria work

641
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,178
really really well with mycorrhizae

642
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:10,500
that's why for example our pro-mix plus

643
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:12,298
line there's mycorrhizae and uh bacillus

644
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,400
inside or green media because they work

645
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:16,259
really really well together and for

646
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,659
example if you're already using a

647
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:20,579
standalone product based back which is

648
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:24,120
some bacteria is going to help

649
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:26,278
definitely because bacteria work well

650
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,759
when you have organic Surfers available

651
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:31,859
because they grow on the root you know

652
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,839
and if you have the IV Network that is

653
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:35,879
well developed well it's more surface

654
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,720
for your bacteria to grow so there's

655
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,720
definitely a good Synergy with most

656
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,819
bacteria and mycorrhizae yeah okay good

657
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,038
to hear and I mean a bit earlier you

658
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:49,740
mentioned how mycorrhiza sort of

659
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,538
directly can affect the plant's immune

660
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,419
system through the way it connects with

661
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:58,319
the roots something I always try to talk

662
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,880
to people or listeners is about how when

663
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,278
you affect the plant's immune system

664
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,679
beneficially you're essentially just

665
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,500
increasing its ability to fight off

666
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,298
pests to fight off pathogens things like

667
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,179
that would you say that essentially

668
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:14,879
mycorrhiza is doing that as well

669
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,460
yeah definitely uh you know it's a big

670
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,860
resistant to stress uh you know if

671
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,900
you're using mycorized the outdoor uh

672
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:24,178
the death rate of your crop is going to

673
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,880
be way lower than without it because you

674
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,759
know it's a bigger resistant to stress

675
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,100
and you just you just set it uh if

676
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,099
you're able to defend yourself against

677
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:37,740
pests and stuff like that uh well that

678
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:39,658
translates into higher terpenes I higher

679
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,519
carabinoids because you know those

680
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,700
compounding cannabis wasn't meant for

681
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,519
for human to get high uh it's a it's a

682
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,038
defense mechanism from the plan so if

683
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,139
you're able to defend yourself more

684
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,240
easily you know produce more terpene and

685
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,120
more cannabinoids you know

686
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,679
yeah I I wholeheartedly agree and I love

687
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,139
I love that you bring that up you know

688
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,419
like as um as much as we'd like to think

689
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,038
we're Masters of the Universe this uh

690
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,360
this plant that's near and dear to our

691
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,000
heart is essentially just trying to

692
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,038
fight off some bugs at its core

693
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,079
exactly exactly

694
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,960
that's good I don't know who told me

695
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,480
that but uh basically cannabis is a

696
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,340
sexually frustrated plant it's just

697
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,919
trying to reproduce itself and we're not

698
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:25,139
letting it it like reproduce itself we

699
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,120
don't want to have any seeds so she's

700
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,799
just keeping on putting flowers and

701
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,079
hoping that some pollen is going to come

702
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:34,259
his way oh my God that's hilarious

703
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:35,939
exactly there you go okay cool well I

704
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,558
mean something I've done in the past and

705
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,538
I'm happy to throw myself under the bus

706
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:41,339
here a little bit with this is I sort of

707
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:43,259
just wanted to experiment a bit and make

708
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,778
some weird and wonderful microbial

709
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,000
mixtures so I'd sort of just mix a few

710
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:49,798
different microbial powders together and

711
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,079
then make a little slurry and apply it

712
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,778
to the roots and just sort of see how it

713
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,418
goes have you heard anything about that

714
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:59,519
working good working bad is there any

715
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,620
mixtures you might recommend avoiding

716
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,480
like I guess maybe one I was thinking

717
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,519
about initially was do you want to avoid

718
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,380
mixing different fungal spores together

719
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,639
or not a real problem with that what's

720
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,799
your take

721
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,020
like I said before I I don't really

722
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,298
concern myself to be like a grower per

723
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:18,658
se so I don't have a lot of knowledge on

724
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:21,480
that subject but you know uh I know

725
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:24,179
Growers that are using uh you know live

726
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,919
bed to grow cannabis you know mixing a

727
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,840
lot of different kind of different

728
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,419
different compost a different type of

729
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,778
microorganism you know creating like an

730
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:36,360
alive soil and I definitely see people

731
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:38,400
having a lot of success with that uh but

732
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,558
if you're asking my personal opinion I I

733
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,900
just I just find that it's maybe a bit

734
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,940
more trouble because you're having the

735
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,000
locks and that you provide you have like

736
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,259
an external containers you know so you

737
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,359
are able to control what you're

738
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:53,460
providing to your plan so why putting

739
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,918
like so much into it and not able to

740
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,900
manage like specifically when you you

741
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,940
want to create you know

742
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,100
okay sure

743
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,960
and another one I'd sort of always

744
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,240
wondered about which I think you might

745
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,659
be able to answer for me is sometimes

746
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,519
when I'd seen people making compost like

747
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,860
mixing a bunch of amendments like you

748
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,538
know maybe Alfalfa and kelp and a big

749
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,759
pile and then cooking it up before they

750
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:20,879
eventually grow with it I had seen them

751
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,500
adding mycorizer at that step and just

752
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,820
when they mix their compost pile and

753
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,038
then let it sit for a while and I

754
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:28,079
thought did the spores just sit there

755
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:29,640
stagnant waiting or what what do you

756
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,699
think happens there

757
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,620
uh you know we haven't made any story on

758
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,480
that I don't think so but uh personally

759
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:38,219
I think that maybe there could be some

760
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,259
effect at some point because maybe some

761
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,179
of the spores gonna stay dormant into

762
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:43,919
the compost but at the same time there's

763
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:47,880
so much hate into it

764
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,159
probably most of it's gonna die uh but

765
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,860
depending on how you proceed maybe some

766
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,080
of the the My Crazy gonna stay alive and

767
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,819
at some point if you're having there's

768
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,859
proximity with the root that is growing

769
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:02,038
into the compost or the mix that you

770
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,538
created there's going to be some effect

771
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:05,579
at some point

772
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,319
yeah I guess that's what I sort of

773
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:10,259
figured that like you're sort of trying

774
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:12,599
to Prime the medium to be ready for the

775
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:15,538
roots but yeah I guess that that hot

776
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:18,119
composting process might might take its

777
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:19,798
toll on some of the spores okay well I

778
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,719
mean on the other end of the spectrum

779
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:23,579
another thing I'd sort of wondered in a

780
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,980
similar fashion was when people were

781
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,898
Brewing teas or making nutrients for

782
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,000
their plants and they might you know

783
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:31,739
bubble it with an air stone for a few

784
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,740
days before they use it and they were

785
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,419
throwing mycorrhizae powder into that

786
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,579
mixture and letting it bubble for a few

787
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,700
days do you have any thoughts on that

788
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:45,178
side of process

789
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:47,399
uh like I I said earlier it's kind of uh

790
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:50,220
tricky to put mycoresis sometime into

791
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,439
water because uh water makes like

792
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,440
chemical compound more available for the

793
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,778
mycorrhizae so sometimes you know oh my

794
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,360
crazy preserve is that the spores are

795
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:02,819
dormant you know and when you put it in

796
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,439
contact with water they can they can

797
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:07,379
come across some chemicals that gonna

798
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,298
you know trigger them to to germinate

799
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,440
and when they germinate at some point

800
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:13,379
they're not going to have any energy

801
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,538
left to create that symbiosis so like

802
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,480
putting it into water it's kind of a

803
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:20,700
risky move right from the get-go uh but

804
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,740
like you just mentioned there's so much

805
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,319
technique out there that definitely stop

806
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,419
at some point in some kind of effect but

807
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,700
definitely not as much as the classic

808
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,259
way that we recommend like directly on

809
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,700
the root system you know

810
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,220
okay

811
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,100
I think I had read somewhere in the past

812
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,259
that

813
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:43,798
mycorrhizae can die after as little as

814
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:46,619
say 24 hours after being put into water

815
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:48,418
if it doesn't attach to a root does that

816
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,058
sound like there's any truth in that or

817
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,520
maybe it's not quite correct

818
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:56,339
well the first thing there's a lot of

819
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,859
mycorrhizae product uh water-based on

820
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:01,139
the market and if you see a mycorrhizae

821
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,839
product that is water-based and that is

822
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,120
on a shelf and not like a lower like say

823
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:10,139
let's say four degrees temperature

824
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,538
that is what basically won't work uh you

825
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,640
know in water form it's way like I said

826
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:17,879
earlier are there to keep this viable

827
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,740
spores dormant so if they get activated

828
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,240
they like I said they're eventually

829
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,120
gonna die because they won't be able to

830
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,980
connect with any type of roots so it's a

831
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:29,219
bit more tricky when having a

832
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:32,399
formulation water-based formulation

833
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,519
yeah okay sure and I guess it probably

834
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,439
just varies from Brand to Brand as to

835
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,379
how long the spores would be viable in

836
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,940
that situation yeah definitely and it

837
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,100
also depends on the application you know

838
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,200
uh if you're having a powder form that

839
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,699
you're mixing with water right away and

840
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,919
you are playing seriously on the roots

841
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,840
it won't have time to die you know

842
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,360
because you're using the product right

843
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,178
away I'm all talking into like a shelf

844
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:59,639
life uh situation

845
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,460
okay yeah no that that makes sense for

846
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,679
sure so a lot of the people listening to

847
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,259
the show utilize a style of growing

848
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,179
chord no-till where the idea is you're

849
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:11,158
trying not to disturb the soil as much

850
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:13,080
as possible and just sort of taking out

851
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,220
the stump of the old Route putting a new

852
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,220
one in

853
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,079
does that sort of environment lead to

854
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,360
any benefits with the mycorrhizae

855
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,819
because the soil sort of they're long

856
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,038
term or because the roots are in this

857
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:28,200
cycle of like being healthy and then

858
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:29,940
dying off and then new Roots is it sort

859
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,919
of like you're just starting fresh in a

860
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,200
sense each time

861
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,880
uh if I'm interesting correctly you

862
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,058
meaning you're like reusing the same

863
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,740
salt yeah canvas right okay okay well if

864
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:42,178
you're using mycoresia already and

865
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,558
you're keeping the roots in there

866
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,419
there's still going to be some

867
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,240
mycorrhizian sport left because you know

868
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:50,399
when mycoresis grow on Roots it creates

869
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,440
pores or physical and stuff that is able

870
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:56,099
to reconnect eventually with an alive

871
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,320
root system but at the same time uh

872
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:59,939
reusing your soil is always a tricky

873
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,980
business because you know for example

874
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,080
you're purchasing pro-mix for the

875
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,720
porosity you know the structure of the

876
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,639
solar light is provided and you know the

877
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,500
stability of the ph and stuff like that

878
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,419
but that's something that over time

879
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,398
you're You're Gonna Lose because there's

880
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:17,460
compaction you know the fiber of the

881
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,079
peas gonna get degraded all of those

882
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,099
stuff that's going to come into play as

883
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,219
well

884
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,019
okay sure yeah so I guess it sort of

885
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,838
would be a bit of a challenging

886
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:30,179
undertaking for someone to try to like

887
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,739
reuse the same pot just again and again

888
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,659
again just to try to like get their own

889
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:36,239
mycorrhizer right

890
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,980
yes and no like I mean I I may be more

891
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,019
talking into like a commercial business

892
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,059
type of thing but if you're like trying

893
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:43,980
some stuff at home like craft cannabis

894
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:46,259
and trying new things there's you know

895
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,579
you can try whatever you want and see

896
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:52,020
see how it goes I I seen people doing so

897
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:53,579
much different thing and I've ex having

898
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:55,739
success you know it's not because

899
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,259
personally me I'm not doing it that is

900
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,000
not good but I I I see it maybe

901
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,339
difficult to do it like in a commercial

902
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,519
scales but you know if you're going for

903
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:08,099
fun at home definitely you can try it

904
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:11,119
something I had always wondered was you

905
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:14,220
often hear about foods for microbes

906
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,900
bacterial or fungal is there any food

907
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,019
you can give to help make your

908
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,440
mycorrhiza more happy so to speak

909
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:24,659
naturally yeah it's because you know

910
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,659
basilius and bacteria are able to like

911
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:30,179
get their food or their nutrients in the

912
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:33,299
soil you know so that would be like for

913
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:35,219
for bacteria like yeah you could you can

914
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,099
apply some stuff that will help their

915
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,838
development but you know to develop

916
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:42,599
itself mycores you just need to plant

917
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,699
that's they they get their nutrient

918
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,980
their energy from the plant so even if

919
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:50,519
you are adding any type of you know

920
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,920
sugar or stuff into your your media uh

921
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:54,838
if it benefit the mycorrises because

922
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,200
it's going to benefit the plant and not

923
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:00,659
directly the mycorrhizae yeah okay that

924
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,399
I mean that's sort of in line with the

925
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,379
principle organic Growers use anyway

926
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,539
feeding the soil not the plant so I

927
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,200
guess it's the same with the micro so

928
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:13,259
yeah exactly as far as you're aware are

929
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,659
there any factors which can improve the

930
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,640
efficiency of the mycorrhiza once it's

931
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:19,139
been applied to the plant

932
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,539
uh

933
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:23,879
uh well we touched point on that earlier

934
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:25,800
but I definitely like the uh the amount

935
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,960
of phosphorus that you're applying right

936
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,900
after it I I would say like to low down

937
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,940
below 20 PPM would be like a

938
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,338
recommendation to ensure that the

939
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,700
symbiosis get going uh more easily and

940
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:40,338
faster yeah okay so I guess I'm sort of

941
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:42,739
thinking like

942
00:36:40,338 --> 00:36:45,599
demycorrhized a favor any particular

943
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:47,939
medium composition over others or it's

944
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,039
all pretty much effective of similar

945
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,099
proportion no matter what Medium you're

946
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,838
in uh to be totally honest would you I I

947
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,059
feel like is going to work well in any

948
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,039
type of environment because you know

949
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:00,900
mycoresis also be known to help the

950
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,820
structure of the soil it's such a small

951
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,619
structure that pretty much any type of

952
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,780
soil that it's in is going to thrive and

953
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,119
develop itself really easily you know

954
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,099
compaction is not really an obstacle for

955
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,838
mycorrhizae so I would say it's going to

956
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:16,440
thrive in pretty much all those

957
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,358
environment okay sure I've been doing a

958
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,940
lot of reading about the pro-mix connect

959
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:22,920
product and I guess I'm sort of

960
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,380
wondering are there any specifics about

961
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,358
it or the production methods which you

962
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,300
feel helped set it apart from others

963
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:33,420
well uh we've talked all over the

964
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,339
premier Tech you know using uh in uh in

965
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,559
Virtual technique which is a big part of

966
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:39,779
our success you know we're in hours

967
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,900
producing Irma crazy having full control

968
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,480
of all the process from A to Z you know

969
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,338
a lot of brand out there are co-packing

970
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,800
that are actually producing my crazy and

971
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:51,599
just putting in a bag so of course you

972
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,839
don't have the same control as we have

973
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,240
uh you know we've been doing that for so

974
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:59,820
long now that we're really expert into

975
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:02,879
not only producing macarizoni but

976
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,160
formulating mycorrezae and not only that

977
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,820
but promise connect has been developed

978
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:10,199
exclusively with cannabis in mind

979
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,920
and you know

980
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,739
um

981
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,838
when you deal with microbes in the live

982
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:17,659
microorganism the first thing is it

983
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,980
needs to be viable they need to be alive

984
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:23,039
and that's something that we guarantee

985
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,800
we have 6 000 viables pores inside our

986
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,659
product so there's nothing nothing dead

987
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,359
in there so you know what you're paying

988
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:32,159
for and after that we guarantee the

989
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:34,380
concentration six thousand thousand

990
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,539
valuable spores is by far the most

991
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,780
concentrated product out there there's

992
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:42,059
not even someone that is coming close so

993
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,160
having a higher concentration you know

994
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:47,219
you you have a better chance to get the

995
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,618
symbiosis established quickly so better

996
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:52,799
benefit at the end as well

997
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,780
and the last thing we've developed it as

998
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,539
a weightable pattern because cannabis is

999
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,900
such a short crop you know you want the

1000
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:03,358
symbiosis to get going fast so you have

1001
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,639
a concentrated product that it's a alive

1002
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,019
and close to the root system as a

1003
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:10,440
wettable powder

1004
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:14,338
yeah okay I think in the past I had read

1005
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,320
some sort of different units used in I

1006
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:18,119
think it might have been like BTU or

1007
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,220
something like that and they're talking

1008
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,039
in the billions or the thousands are

1009
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:25,259
there different sort of units used to

1010
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,179
sort of measure the activity of the

1011
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,560
product or it's all standardized in like

1012
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:30,838
the Spore count

1013
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,719
uh I would like it to be standardized

1014
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,219
but it really isn't most mycorizing

1015
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:38,098
products out there are listed as

1016
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:40,019
propagal uh which isn't necessarily a

1017
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,000
bad thing propagos is a real term you

1018
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:44,699
know but probably propagals stand for

1019
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,579
any part of the fungi that may connect

1020
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:49,559
with the root system eventually

1021
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,119
but at the same time that could be a

1022
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,338
knife feed it could be a root fragment

1023
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,338
with some physical you know it could be

1024
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:58,320
an unviable spores and all of that is

1025
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:01,019
counted into the concentration of the

1026
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,338
product but at the end of the day none

1027
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:05,639
of those structure is going to have an

1028
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:07,619
impact on on the plan only viable spores

1029
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,779
are able to efficiently colonize the

1030
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,019
roots so that's why we don't even count

1031
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,780
those in promise connect it's strictly 6

1032
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:17,579
000 viable spores and you can often see

1033
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,460
product out there let's say for example

1034
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,980
500 purples per gram but at the end of

1035
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,159
the day you end up having like 50 10

1036
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:29,460
viable spores in inside the program so

1037
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,379
you know we would like to get more

1038
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,900
education out there about mycorrhizino

1039
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,880
viable spores versus propagals because

1040
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,579
definitely it make a big difference

1041
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,800
between two products

1042
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:43,260
yeah I guess if someone had used

1043
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,760
mycorrhizer in the past and they hadn't

1044
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,220
felt like they got particularly good

1045
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,200
benefit from it maybe they just need to

1046
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:51,179
try again with something with a bit more

1047
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,319
guaranteed activity in the Box do you

1048
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:55,379
think

1049
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,820
yeah definitely uh you know there's a

1050
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,760
lot of product out there and I don't

1051
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,700
want to do any name drop or or anything

1052
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,440
but you know uh the viability of the the

1053
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:06,179
product is just isn't there each and

1054
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,338
every year permitech we test every

1055
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:10,399
product on the market and you know uh

1056
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:12,960
the viability of the product is just

1057
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,720
everywhere all over the place it's it's

1058
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,480
it's really rare that a product uh came

1059
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,879
up with the same claim as uh as it says

1060
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,280
on the packaging so I would definitely

1061
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,640
say to try you know a product that

1062
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,240
guaranteed a viability of their spores

1063
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:32,639
yeah okay good stuff good stuff so I

1064
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,219
mean I guess I'm wondering if you were

1065
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:38,039
trying to sort of describe to someone

1066
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:40,019
Mike Horizon who you know not so

1067
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:41,219
familiar with the ins and outs of it and

1068
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,259
they're just sort of looking for the

1069
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:46,559
major points how would you describe the

1070
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:49,619
major benefits of using it

1071
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,940
you know it it's all linked together of

1072
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,858
course because you know you're having

1073
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,559
you pick up nutrients and more water

1074
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:57,000
more easily but all the benefits we're

1075
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,460
basically putting them in four

1076
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,320
categories uh it would say it would be

1077
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,079
like healthier in an inch root system

1078
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,760
first uh you know because having that

1079
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,800
iPhone network helping the root system

1080
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,440
you're able to have like a bigger root

1081
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,039
mass you know a bigger nicest

1082
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,740
establishment of your root system uh and

1083
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,480
then you go at faster growth and yet you

1084
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:22,199
know it make only sense since you've

1085
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,260
picked up nutrient and water uh easier

1086
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:27,838
you're going to be able to put more mass

1087
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:29,760
quickly and that's it's kind of a big

1088
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,799
deal because being able to put more mass

1089
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,020
quickly you're able sometimes to shove a

1090
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,640
couple of days of badge which in a

1091
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:38,519
commercial standpoint is a really really

1092
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:41,159
useful useful thing

1093
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,019
um after that I would say it of course

1094
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,960
the increased crop yield you're able to

1095
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:47,699
have a bigger structure and be most more

1096
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,639
energy every available you're able to

1097
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:51,319
produce you know a bigger flower at the

1098
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,239
end

1099
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,280
and the last thing in my mind the most

1100
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,259
important is is higher quality

1101
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,500
consistently we've tested higher

1102
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,480
terpenes content and and um and

1103
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,760
cannabinoids

1104
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,338
yeah some really strong selling points

1105
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,660
there though I think a lot of people who

1106
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,960
listen to this show are probably already

1107
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:15,420
quite Avid fans of mycorrhizae so it's

1108
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,220
now just time to get onto the pro-mix

1109
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,180
train and see what benefits it has in

1110
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,219
store

1111
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:22,098
something I was wondering given you guys

1112
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:25,799
are now doing the pro-mix connect is

1113
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:27,720
what is the the future of Premier Tech

1114
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,060
are there any sort of fields you guys

1115
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:32,219
are thinking about expanding into or is

1116
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:34,078
there a a further step with the

1117
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:35,939
mycorrhizal products you want to go in

1118
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,818
where do you see yourself you where do

1119
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,099
you see the company going in the future

1120
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:42,838
well you know I would like to elaborate

1121
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:45,300
on that but of course I cannot you know

1122
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:46,980
tell too much about it but I you know

1123
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,260
protect has always been a company about

1124
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,818
Innovation and research so I can

1125
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,920
definitely tell you that we're always

1126
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:54,358
working on something and I can tell you

1127
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,579
that we're specifically working on

1128
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:58,920
something on cannabis we have a lot of

1129
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:00,960
Technologies available that uh

1130
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,760
eventually were be able to maybe bring

1131
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,699
to the market so we're definitely

1132
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,380
working on some stuff I'm I'm hoping to

1133
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:08,879
uh to bring them to the market as soon

1134
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,460
as possible you know

1135
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,000
exciting we'll have to keep our eyes

1136
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,679
open for that one I mean probably not

1137
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,260
going to be too hard for people but

1138
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:21,539
where can people find pro-mix connect if

1139
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,420
they're looking to give it a try

1140
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,920
uh I can probably provide you with uh

1141
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,960
with the link we have a landing page

1142
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,300
about the connect uh it listed all the

1143
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,880
address or that is available and when

1144
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,220
we're also online uh with uh indoor

1145
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,800
growing Canada which is available all

1146
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:39,779
across Canada as well and it

1147
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,119
probably in the US in the next couple of

1148
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,000
couple of weeks so yeah pretty much

1149
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:48,780
available all across North America

1150
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,579
ah fantastic and I mean long term do you

1151
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,980
expect that people will probably be able

1152
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:54,599
to find it in you know their sort of

1153
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,039
local grow store or their best bet is

1154
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,359
just to go online get it shipped

1155
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:59,159
directly to them

1156
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,779
uh depend on your habits we're

1157
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:03,539
definitely not taking the hydro store

1158
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,280
out where we want to gather the hydro

1159
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:07,619
store space because we still believe

1160
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,720
that it's it's a strong space to be in

1161
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:12,480
uh but of course with everything that

1162
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,759
happened in the last the last year

1163
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,699
um you know e-commerce has come a long

1164
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,619
way so you know we're gonna try to be

1165
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:22,199
available on that space as well

1166
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:24,900
so and I mean for the people who like to

1167
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:27,539
go to the face-to-face events when they

1168
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,858
resume back up do you guys have stalls

1169
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:31,019
there can people come and ask you

1170
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:33,059
questions things like that

1171
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:35,818
uh you know we're gonna start to get

1172
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:38,099
more and more out there uh you know the

1173
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:40,739
world is kind of starting it again so

1174
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:43,079
we're at a lot of uh show throughout the

1175
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,779
years we're gonna you know be be out

1176
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,780
there interacting with people so yes uh

1177
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,160
I cannot in the top of Maya top of my

1178
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,680
head tell you all the shows that we're

1179
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,940
gonna be in but definitely we're gonna

1180
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,980
be out there

1181
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,599
yeah now that's good to hear hopefully

1182
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,818
people can catch you at some of the

1183
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,619
shows and one of the final questions I

1184
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:04,559
have for you is some of our listeners

1185
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:06,599
operate bigger size facilities and sort

1186
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,940
of you know have those more serious

1187
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,220
operations do you guys provide different

1188
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,780
sizing are there sort of bigger bundles

1189
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:14,098
available to people if they're looking

1190
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,260
to get like you know a sort of

1191
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:18,000
substantially bigger size

1192
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:21,960
uh the biggest size that we have

1193
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,719
available is 2.5 kilogram uh which three

1194
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,119
is around 700 plan uh depending on how

1195
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:30,539
you use it so that's that's our biggest

1196
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,180
packaging uh but of course

1197
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:36,300
um it's easier to go into like a bigger

1198
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:38,879
bigger format for like let's say a big

1199
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,200
big big customer so we're open to maybe

1200
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,460
having having something bigger

1201
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:43,739
eventually

1202
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,720
so sort of in line with that topic we

1203
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:47,159
were talking about earlier where you

1204
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,779
know some products advertise in

1205
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,118
different units and they're different

1206
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,240
sizes and different prices and it it can

1207
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,519
become quite complex quite quickly do

1208
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,879
you feel that there's an easy way to

1209
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,039
sort of Judge what is bringing value in

1210
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,740
terms of a mycorrhizal product

1211
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:07,318
uh yeah of course that you know there's

1212
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:09,779
a lot of product out there so it's come

1213
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,338
confusing like very quickly but the

1214
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,440
thing that you need to look at basically

1215
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:14,880
is the number of valuable spores you

1216
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,838
know because a lot of people out there

1217
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,160
are shopping a price for a weight but at

1218
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:22,739
the end of the day you're not paying for

1219
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,559
a carrier you don't want to pay for clay

1220
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:27,959
you're paying for mycoresi and what

1221
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:31,078
brings value to my crazy is the number

1222
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,000
of variable spores so yes some product

1223
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,579
like Pro mix connect we know it we're

1224
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,619
high-end product of course but at six

1225
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,599
thousand viable spores when you take it

1226
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:42,539
into account we're kind of the most

1227
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,160
affordable crazy product out there based

1228
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:46,920
on the concentration

1229
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,019
yeah that makes total sense and I think

1230
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,700
that's just about everything I had to

1231
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:52,259
ask you Matt thanks so much for coming

1271

background on yourself and how you ended

1272
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,920
up coming to work with coppet

1273
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,598
um I've always actually couldn't grow I

1274
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,159
grew up in the greenhouse industry like

1275
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,260
in the commercial originates from the

1276
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,699
commercial ornamental industry I worked

1277
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,900
for since I was like 15 and that's all

1278
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:45,358
I've ever did is what I went to school

1279
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,039
for and then I used to be a grower at a

1280
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,500
big commercial greenhouse and then I

1281
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,599
moved into some other aspects of it and

1282
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,358
then I ended up at corporate about 15

1283
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,740
years ago and they were kind of always

1284
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,059
around in the industry they're you know

1285
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:59,818
back in the day they weren't quite as

1286
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:02,338
prevalent style controls one is uh

1287
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:03,838
commonly used but uh yeah when it

1288
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:05,219
started to take off and it was always

1289
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:08,099
something that interests me so I

1290
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:10,500
switched over to uh to working here

1291
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:13,200
wow that's a that's a cool little Story

1292
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,960
I mean it must have been an interesting

1293
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,519
journey to sort of transition from you

1294
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,079
know like a non-cannabis related

1295
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,079
Horticultural field to sort of being

1296
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,599
more in the in the active scene of the

1297
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,240
the Cannabis related field have you

1298
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:28,980
enjoyed that so far

1299
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:30,959
yeah like just to be clear I kind of

1300
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,280
grew up around both things I was always

1301
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,260
kind of involved in the Cannabis

1302
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,119
industry at the same time

1303
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,480
um back in the as kind of involved in

1304
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,880
the early days in the medical scene in

1305
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,920
Canada and I used to work actually it

1306
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,019
used to be the cultivation writer for uh

1307
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,119
cannabis Culture magazine but this is

1308
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:50,880
back in like the 90s and then that kind

1309
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,579
of had an equal footing both in the

1310
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,940
commercial Greenhouse part and uh

1311
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:59,940
and the Cannabis part as well

1312
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:02,039
yeah awesome okay yeah so quite a quite

1313
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,800
a depth of experience you've already got

1314
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,539
under your belt so one of the things I

1315
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,980
wanted to sort of start out chatting

1316
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:10,679
with or the place I wanted to start our

1317
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,838
discussion was sort of the utility and

1318
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:14,759
the benefits of predator mites it's been

1319
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:17,460
something which for example in Australia

1320
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,319
has only recently sort of come to light

1321
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,659
whereas I'm sure in places like Canada

1322
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:23,400
and America where the technology has

1323
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:25,318
been established there a bit longer

1324
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,599
probably more aware of it and whatnot

1325
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:29,699
but I guess something I'd love to talk

1326
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,920
about starting out is how would you

1327
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:34,078
describe predator mites and what would

1328
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,818
be sort of a sales pitch for someone

1329
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,380
who's a bit on the fern so not quite

1330
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:38,400
sure how to use them or what they're

1331
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,619
used for

1332
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,000
yeah I think the first thing is that I

1333
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,740
think maybe what people don't realize is

1334
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
how long they've actually been used for

1335
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,338
so

1336
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,659
um everyone a lot of the people in the

1337
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,279
canvas industry they kind of seem to

1338
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:53,039
think that it's like this new thing when

1339
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:56,160
cannabis started it's really been going

1340
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,920
on like since the 80s at least in uh

1341
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,719
commercial uh

1342
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,480
vegetables it wasn't in ornamentals uh

1343
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,399
up until somewhat more recent but

1344
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,900
um it was always just not an organic

1345
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,838
vegetable position like conventional

1346
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,619
vegetables it's always been a standard

1347
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,719
um

1348
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,180
and in the last like I said I've been

1349
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,299
here 15 years and probably most of the

1350
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:20,399
time I've been here it was also

1351
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,019
ornamentals this became a standard

1352
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,260
um so canvas is kind of the last thing

1353
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:26,940
so it's a very well proven strategy

1354
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,040
um and most of the most of our customers

1355
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,500
like a lot of people think that bio

1356
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,300
controls is something that it's like a

1357
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,159
cosmetic type of thing or makes you feel

1358
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,480
good that you're doing it but most of

1359
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,358
our customers are actually like

1360
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,500
conventional AG that they're not organic

1361
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:42,659
or anything they just use it because

1362
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,519
it's actually a really good cost

1363
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:47,279
effective solution but they use it in

1364
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:51,059
combination with you know pesticides or

1365
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,760
or other other strategies

1366
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:56,819
that's a really brilliant point the

1367
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,640
utility of predators across multiple

1368
00:52:56,818 --> 00:53:02,099
different systems I guess a lot of

1369
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,019
people who follow the organic principles

1370
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:05,940
of growing are generally sort of

1371
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:09,358
interested in this sort of holistic

1372
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:11,700
style of management and whatnot how best

1373
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,980
should people apply Predator mine so

1374
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:16,318
I've always sort of advocated to people

1375
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:18,480
that you know if you imagine you're a

1376
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,800
city and your city's under attack you

1377
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,539
kind of want to have the Army already

1378
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,460
there ready to go to help defend you

1379
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:24,779
rather than having to master it up once

1380
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,400
you're under attack and you know

1381
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:28,380
everything's on fire and it's a bit of

1382
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,519
an issue do you agree with that do you

1383
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,220
think people should sort of

1384
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:35,099
prophylactically be using predator mites

1385
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:37,199
to help mitigate any potential issues or

1386
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:38,818
do you more Advocate to use them when

1387
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,098
required

1388
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:43,259
uh definitely proactively but you can

1389
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:44,880
also use them like curatively so I'd say

1390
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,000
the real answer is it's a combination

1391
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,760
you want to have them in the crop but

1392
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,559
you usually need to kind of switch gears

1393
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,660
into different predator mites when you

1394
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,980
get a situation so for instance like

1395
00:53:54,659 --> 00:54:01,139
kind of a standard in cannabis is

1396
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,940
um generally people are picking kind of

1397
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:05,219
a generalist Predator is kind of like

1398
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,440
their base so that would be it's

1399
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:09,539
typically swersky or cucamaris and it's

1400
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,099
a predator might that it's a generous

1401
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:13,800
where it can eat a lot of different

1402
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:16,079
stuff but it's primarily Focus like it's

1403
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:20,160
preferences thrips which is generally on

1404
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:22,079
cannabis kind of the main test

1405
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,440
um so you're kind of working from that

1406
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,940
and then you stack other stuff on top if

1407
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,980
you have the issues so sorry they would

1408
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,838
Source or cucamaris would kind of be the

1409
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,699
base and then if you're in a garden that

1410
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:34,858
you know consistently has like spider

1411
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:37,858
mite problems that you're expecting then

1412
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:39,719
we would put in uh spycal which is the

1413
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:41,400
tree name but it's California and that's

1414
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:43,199
kind of for spider mites it's like a

1415
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,960
preventative level but then for instance

1416
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:49,098
if you get Spiderman's kind of raging a

1417
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,539
little bit you need to move over to

1418
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:53,338
spitex which is persimuless so they've

1419
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:55,199
all got kind of their own little niche

1420
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:56,940
so a lot of it's about starting off

1421
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,460
preventatively and stacking them

1422
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,858
accordingly

1423
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,480
yeah that's a that's a great point you

1424
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:05,279
make there and it sort of segues into

1425
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,800
the next question I had for you which

1426
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,380
was that if you look on the website

1427
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,960
there's really nice information about

1428
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,000
the different Predators what they can be

1429
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,980
used to combat a whole bunch of

1430
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,480
interesting and wonderful extra bits of

1431
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,858
information and something I noticed

1432
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,599
which you sort of just touched on is

1433
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,338
that they can be a bit of overlap you

1434
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,380
know you read different predators and

1435
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:26,699
maybe a commonality between a few

1436
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,800
different ones you read about is that

1437
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:31,739
they're all good for affids for example

1438
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,380
so my question would be how would you go

1439
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:36,719
about selecting the product to use if

1440
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:39,539
you're seeing a few of them that all uh

1441
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,578
covering aphids for example are you safe

1442
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:43,679
with any of them is there a way in which

1443
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,000
you might figure out one maybe out edges

1444
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:46,500
the other's a little better for your

1445
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,059
situation how would you go about

1446
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,980
choosing that

1447
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,300
so when you get into aphids in

1448
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,000
particular that's

1449
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,619
probably for sure the most tricky one

1450
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,440
when it comes to anything especially

1451
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:00,838
cannabis because that's one that their

1452
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,000
the controls are very like the Predators

1453
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:04,799
are very specific to the type of acids

1454
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,239
so the absolute

1455
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,400
first thing you need to do is actually

1456
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:09,779
ID what type of aphid you're dealing

1457
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,539
with most of the time and I'll say

1458
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:15,540
there's a couple of caveats it's a it's

1459
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:18,179
a big box that Aphid control thing so if

1460
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,338
you're using parasitoids which is kind

1461
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:23,098
of our usually our standard approach on

1462
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:25,078
most crops so a parasitoid

1463
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:26,880
um it's like a wasp not like a wasp

1464
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,380
sting she was just a parasitic wash like

1465
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,818
kind of maybe as big as a mosquito or

1466
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,079
something and what it does is it's

1467
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:33,539
really good at searching the crop so

1468
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,880
it'll fly the crop and it's smelling out

1469
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:39,119
aphids and when it finds an aphid it

1470
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,858
lays its egg in the aphid and makes

1471
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,700
what's called a mummy

1472
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:44,578
um

1473
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:46,858
so and then instead of the aphid so the

1474
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:48,780
aphid slowly dies the parasite takes

1475
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,759
over and at the end another parasite

1476
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,160
hatches out of the eight so that's

1477
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,900
usually our standard because it's a

1478
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,000
really nice thing to keep going in your

1479
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,280
crop because you only just it just you

1480
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,199
know for every one if it you know for

1481
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,400
one bio control you put out there I'm

1482
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:03,899
just making up a number I don't know how

1483
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,240
many years but let's say it's 48 bits

1484
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,680
that it parasitizes so for every one

1485
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:10,618
aphid you put in you're actually getting

1486
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:12,719
40 back you know the first two weeks

1487
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,700
later and then all of those go and lay

1488
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,399
eggs of salads so it really Builds an

1489
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,318
Army in the crop so for that those

1490
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,119
parasitoids are very

1491
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:23,219
um specific so for instance if you're

1492
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,559
dealing with like cannabis aphid

1493
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:28,439
um the one this kind of three main

1494
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:32,119
parasitoids and we found one of them

1495
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,119
works a lot better on

1496
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:40,139
for RV works as well fairly well and

1497
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:41,879
then

1498
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:43,139
um Coleman he doesn't work Coleman he's

1499
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,579
another parasitic boss doesn't work

1500
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:46,318
hardly at all

1501
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:47,940
um so you really have to be very

1502
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,440
specific because if you go at it with

1503
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,280
the wrong Paris to it it'll literally do

1504
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,559
nothing

1505
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,420
so we kind of go at it from a couple of

1506
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,040
approaches so that's the parasitic wasp

1507
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,838
is kind of the more traditional approach

1508
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,358
and then you've got like a completely

1509
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,880
different approach which would be more

1510
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:04,739
like a predator bug so that's what when

1511
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,900
people think about ladybugs that's what

1512
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:10,139
a ladybug is just like actually eating

1513
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,880
the the aphid we don't use ladybugs too

1514
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:13,139
much but we use a lot of lace Wings in

1515
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,099
cannabis

1516
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:16,920
um

1517
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:19,200
so the you know the advantage on

1518
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,039
cannabis I guess in some situations is

1519
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:24,058
that the lacewings are eating

1520
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:25,619
indiscriminate so you don't have to ID

1521
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:27,480
the aphid anymore it's just going to eat

1522
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:29,880
whatever it sees and it also doesn't

1523
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,619
leave aphids in the crop which sometimes

1524
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,318
parasitoids because they're leaving that

1525
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:36,358
little you know little zombie mummy is

1526
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,338
still there you can get some crop

1527
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:40,500
contamination potentially so the lace

1528
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:42,659
Wing is just eating it completely you

1529
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:45,599
don't have to worry about iding it but

1530
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:48,779
the downside is in order for a lace Wing

1531
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,818
to reproduce where a parasitic wasp only

1532
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,319
needs one egg lay swing needs again I'm

1533
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:54,119
making them I'm not kind of all these

1534
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,219
numbers memorized but let's say it needs

1535
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,260
to eat 20 aphids to get enough protein

1536
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:00,239
to reproduce

1537
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,400
so a lot of the time it's not getting 20

1538
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,379
aphids so it's it's not really

1539
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,940
reproducing so you just kind of putting

1540
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,140
it in almost like a pesticide you put it

1541
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:10,798
out it crawls around eats a bunch of

1542
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:12,298
aphids and then it dies so

1543
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,280
I still think no matter what you're

1544
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,679
always really the most important thing

1545
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,359
if Aphid control is ID in the aphid and

1546
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:20,519
a lot of times from that you really need

1547
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:22,380
to talk to an expert like a bio control

1548
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,539
company or somebody like that that can

1549
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:27,119
an entomologist that can actually say no

1550
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:28,858
that's cannabis aphid or whatever that's

1551
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,180
always like the first step in most pest

1552
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:32,159
control make sure you actually know what

1553
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:34,500
you're dealing with

1554
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,598
yeah brilliant answer and you you sort

1555
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,639
of raise two really good Avenues I'd

1556
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:40,619
love to pursue a little more I mean just

1557
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,598
on the end there you mentioned the

1558
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:44,519
Cannabis aphid which some people

1559
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,079
probably be aware of but yeah over the

1560
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:48,719
past few years we've seen the emergence

1561
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:51,119
of this new sort of aphid which seems

1562
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,739
specific for cannabis I guess the

1563
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,099
question is do you think that it's

1564
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:57,659
inevitable as a cannabis community so to

1565
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:59,700
speak that it's going to sort of

1566
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:02,399
inadvertently cause the development of

1567
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:04,259
new and resistant bugs over time

1568
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,338
yeah I mean that's an interesting one

1569
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,619
because like I said I've been around

1570
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:10,099
like canvas Institute for like 30 years

1571
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:12,900
and that really appeared in Canada

1572
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:14,640
exactly when we legalized and the

1573
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,200
difference was there I'm sure it was

1574
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,900
around but I mean it's really just

1575
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:20,879
spread almost 100 just by trading with

1576
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,818
cuttings and I think there just wasn't

1577
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,940
that kind of trade in the old black

1578
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:28,798
market days of vegetative material like

1579
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,720
it was traded amongst like Crews and

1580
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:32,699
stuff like that you know like groups but

1581
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,558
they wasn't traded like wide scale and

1582
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:36,480
that's what we saw as soon as you know

1583
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,420
that LP Market got established in Canada

1584
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,760
it just both cannabis aphid and rude if

1585
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:44,220
it just blew up

1586
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,140
um and almost I would I honestly never

1587
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:47,699
even heard of it before probably kind of

1588
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:50,639
whatever that happened seven years ago

1589
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:54,239
or something and now it's probably one

1590
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:57,900
of the biggest pests in in Canada so I

1591
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:59,879
think the opening of markets really uh

1592
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,500
can be a big Vector for that because a

1593
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,260
lot of these are you've seen the same

1594
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,818
thing with it hopsulating virus where

1595
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,380
um you know it's really just everywhere

1596
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:09,298
now it's another one that probably

1597
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,280
barely existed before because there

1598
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:13,199
wasn't that much trading of clones back

1599
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,900
in the old days

1600
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:18,239
yeah that certainly makes sense I mean

1601
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:21,119
just to take it one more step maybe

1602
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:23,279
towards sort of the more you know quote

1603
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,900
conspiracy theory stuff I remember in

1604
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,599
the past I used to read people talking

1605
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:30,660
about how they used to think that the US

1606
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:33,298
government was releasing mites on the

1607
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:35,759
side of the road and stuff to to combat

1608
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:37,199
sort of vegetative growth and I always

1609
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,520
thought that sounded a bit far-fetched

1610
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:40,679
and then I found a document one day

1611
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:42,539
which said like maybe they're actually

1612
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:44,639
doing that and that's contributed to

1613
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:46,380
like these mites getting then on

1614
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:48,000
cannabis plants and things like that

1615
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,798
have you ever heard or read anything

1616
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,900
like that

1617
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:54,059
I have and it I would say it's probably

1618
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:56,639
not as crazy as it sounds because having

1619
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:59,099
grown up in like the 1980s I remember

1620
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:01,379
like I've never seen anything to say

1621
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:04,200
that was the case and I personally

1622
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,180
lean away from that being the case but I

1623
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:09,318
mean if you were around back in the 80s

1624
01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:12,480
or I think it was early 90s I mean the

1625
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:15,000
DEA 100 was releasing fusarium into

1626
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,079
cannabis crops in other countries I

1627
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,338
think there's a fair bit of evidence

1628
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,839
they've probably released it into

1629
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:21,179
Humboldt like in the you know

1630
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:23,099
concentrated cannabis areas so I mean

1631
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:26,759
it's not unheard of like that that for

1632
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:28,019
sure using you know introducing Pastor

1633
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,420
diseases

1634
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:32,519
to control cannabis is a real thing like

1635
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,980
that's a hundred percent verifiable the

1636
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:36,960
DEA did do that if you look both for

1637
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:38,579
cannabis and cocaine you can look if you

1638
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,079
Google if anyone wants to Google that I

1639
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:42,539
mean there's a ton of evidence that that

1640
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,680
happened down in Colombia and elsewhere

1641
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:46,259
um

1642
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:48,539
the Russian so I mean could they do

1643
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,640
something like that I personally doubt

1644
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:52,679
it because I mean

1645
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,358
at the time it wasn't really something

1646
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:56,759
like a rusted might wasn't really

1647
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:58,318
something that was likely to spread like

1648
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,640
that especially back in the black market

1649
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:01,199
days because I said people just weren't

1650
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,659
the only way you're gonna really spread

1651
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:05,939
that around is by trading cuttings and

1652
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:08,399
uh so I personally doubt it I think it's

1653
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,559
probably like most crops crop pests

1654
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,900
where if I had to look into rust it

1655
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,880
might it seems like it kind of emerged

1656
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,380
probably out of California I know

1657
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,380
there's a lot of that similar type of

1658
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:20,460
Might on

1659
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:22,680
you know and when we're talking about

1660
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:25,199
how for us it might that's for sure a

1661
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:26,940
real thing whether that's the majority

1662
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:28,858
of what we're seeing nobody knows

1663
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,900
because that's that type of Might is

1664
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:33,058
called a tersona midnight and it's like

1665
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:35,039
a cyclamenite abroad might they're all

1666
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:37,260
in that type of class with these tiny

1667
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,599
little mic nobody knows that much about

1668
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:41,700
them so for sure Empress it might is a

1669
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,500
real thing whether that is a hundred

1670
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:45,719
percent of all that type of mites we see

1671
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,719
on cannabis or one percent I don't think

1672
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:50,098
anybody really knows so if it was time

1673
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:51,598
for us it might I would assume it must

1674
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,920
have had to come from hemp at some point

1675
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,059
I don't know the details but if it's

1676
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,220
some of those other ones it could have

1677
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:58,740
come from like for instance grapes where

1678
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:59,879
they get a lot of that or fruit crops

1679
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:01,919
where they get a lot of that type of

1680
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,079
personamic mice you know and what

1681
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,760
happens is that ignosis from where I

1682
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,440
live is there's a lot of it's a really

1683
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,900
intensive agriculture so you'll get like

1684
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,400
let's say corn growing right beside a

1685
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,980
greenhouse that's full of tomatoes and

1686
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,440
there'll be one pest on the corn that

1687
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:18,960
never and even though the corn is only

1688
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,940
you know 10 feet away from the Tomatoes

1689
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,039
they've got they don't the thrips that's

1690
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,659
on the corn isn't on the tomatoes but

1691
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,579
eventually sometimes that jumps so what

1692
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,838
will happen is you know one strips will

1693
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:29,519
just be a little bit more genetically

1694
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:31,259
adapted to tomatoes you know when you're

1695
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:32,759
you know there's a bazillion thrips

1696
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:35,400
landing on those tomatoes from the corn

1697
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,200
every year sooner or later you get a

1698
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,119
couple that are more genetically adapted

1699
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:40,679
to that crop they start reproducing and

1700
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,559
bang all of a sudden I've seen that

1701
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,298
we've got a tomato thrips in my town

1702
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:47,160
um so I think it's more likely something

1703
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:50,099
like that where you know some guy was

1704
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:52,519
you know growing OG beside a Vineyard

1705
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:54,900
and and got some

1706
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:57,599
mites in from there but I mean who knows

1707
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,700
never underestimate for the DEA

1708
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,680
no that's that's some good Insight I

1709
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:04,739
like that explanation it's probably yeah

1710
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,118
some sort of blend of the two just to

1711
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:07,858
jump back to something you mentioned

1712
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:10,019
earlier when I first heard about

1713
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:11,940
Predators I remember in every

1714
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:15,059
conversation I had people were just like

1715
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:16,798
ladybugs ladybugs ladybugs and I guess

1716
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:19,500
as time's gone by I've sort of heard

1717
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:23,338
less and less about them I also remember

1718
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:26,639
that uh praying mantises were like also

1719
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:29,159
you know in that uh top tier Echelon of

1720
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:32,279
predators with ladybugs my question is

1721
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:34,139
in reality do these Predators provide

1722
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,760
you know really effective cover that

1723
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:38,219
people talk about because I think when

1724
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,740
you look up online you know the little

1725
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:43,078
tables which show you you know what bugs

1726
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:45,598
get eaten by what ladybugs and praying

1727
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,339
mantises are often toted as you know

1728
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,440
they'll eat everything they're just like

1729
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:53,539
the cure-all do you think that's maybe

1730
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,539
not quite the reality of the situation

1731
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,420
um yeah so praying mantises I would just

1732
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:58,619
you can fly and say they're really not a

1733
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,000
tool they're a cool thing if you just

1734
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:01,380
want to see a praying mantis wandering

1735
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,380
around in your garden and it will eat

1736
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:05,640
some pests other than that I would say

1737
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:08,460
as far as I would be aware it has

1738
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:10,078
absolutely no place in your garden

1739
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,720
um the reason for praying mantis is

1740
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,880
pretty simple so it's

1741
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,639
a lot of what goes on with bio control

1742
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,880
is how what the numeric response is to

1743
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:22,798
the pest so how quickly that biocontrol

1744
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,260
repurpose a lot of the control isn't

1745
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:27,480
coming necessarily from your releasing

1746
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:30,180
it's coming from what you release

1747
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:33,358
building up in the crop like reproducing

1748
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:36,298
so something like for instance let's say

1749
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:38,400
let's say spider mites so if you were to

1750
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:40,798
use persimulus which is kind of the main

1751
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,000
thing that people use for spider mite I

1752
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:43,440
think the life cycle reproduction is

1753
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,760
like seven days or something like that

1754
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,619
so every seven days you're getting a

1755
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,299
whole new round of the stimulus in your

1756
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:50,099
crop well praying mantis I believe it's

1757
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:51,599
like once a year maybe it's twice a year

1758
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:52,859
I don't know I I don't know so really

1759
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,920
what you're getting is just that one

1760
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:58,519
praying mantis you put in so that's kind

1761
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,159
of one of the things that people really

1762
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:03,838
miss when it comes to that stuff and

1763
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:06,480
then ladybugs is a little bit more

1764
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,920
complicated where I think ladybugs is

1765
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,559
unfortunate the first thing people think

1766
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,460
of when they think about bio control and

1767
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,839
it is really one of the least like

1768
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,639
outside of the Cannabis industry leave

1769
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:20,279
us basically aren't even talked about

1770
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:22,139
they're almost a non-issue

1771
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,539
um and that's kind of for a different

1772
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:25,500
reason so again we go back to people are

1773
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:27,539
saying oh they're great they're

1774
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,519
generalists that's a lot of the time

1775
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:32,400
don't really want what you need is like

1776
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:35,159
something that's just focused on eating

1777
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,298
your pests that you have otherwise you

1778
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:38,159
can get

1779
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:40,259
um weird stuff like I've actually seen

1780
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,399
this for instance on some other

1781
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,280
um

1782
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:46,200
things I've seen it once with one of the

1783
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,760
predatory mics that was a kind of a

1784
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:49,558
generalist as soon as they've got tray

1785
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,359
preferences so we for instance put

1786
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:53,640
something in for Crips and there was

1787
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,739
also white fly and it just really liked

1788
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:58,199
eating white fly and the strips went

1789
01:07:55,739 --> 01:08:00,118
from almost no thrips to taking down the

1790
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,739
crop while this Predator was eating

1791
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:03,240
Wi-Fi it doesn't happen all the time but

1792
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:04,798
that's kind of like when you're talking

1793
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:07,019
about ladybugs you never know really

1794
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:09,298
what they're gonna do but mostly

1795
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:10,920
ladybugs they're they're they are a

1796
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:12,900
Genus but mostly they're focused on

1797
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,119
aphids so

1798
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,460
where that

1799
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:19,500
um where they're typically used again

1800
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,939
again none of this is really new right

1801
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,698
we've been using bio control on

1802
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:25,318
vegetable crops for a long long time at

1803
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:27,358
the standard so it's very dialed in like

1804
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:29,460
which bios have which place in the

1805
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,199
program so where ladybugs are

1806
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:33,179
traditionally used like their strength

1807
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,879
is they're really good at like cleaning

1808
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:37,798
up a nasty hot spot so we would for

1809
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,020
instance have use them a lot in Peppers

1810
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:40,738
or not a lot but sometimes

1811
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:43,080
um

1812
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:44,879
so Peppers you would use parasitic wasps

1813
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:47,039
generally to control your Apes that's

1814
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,659
kind of like your first plan

1815
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:50,880
um because like I said before because

1816
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:53,338
they're late you know I only need one

1817
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,440
aphid to reproduce so they're really

1818
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:56,880
good for cycling themselves in the crop

1819
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,939
so they don't have to keep introducing

1820
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,920
them so we kind of use that then we used

1821
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:03,778
something called aphidend which is like

1822
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,539
a gold Midge so that kind of is more for

1823
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:09,120
working more on hot spots so how a gall

1824
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:12,539
Midge works is it will

1825
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:15,298
instead of laying its eggs in the

1826
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:17,219
in the past like a parasitic wash will

1827
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:19,500
it lays its eggs underneath it so what

1828
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,899
it'll do is find a real nasty hot spot

1829
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,880
lay a bunch of eggs in the hot spot and

1830
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:25,619
then it's the larval stage that eats the

1831
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,960
aphids so it's kind of a bit better in

1832
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:30,960
hot spots so it's kind of our backbone

1833
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,159
of the program is the parasitic wasp so

1834
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,140
if you're talking cannabis it would

1835
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:37,619
probably be

1836
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:39,420
a-fibar M so matricaria and then in some

1837
01:09:37,619 --> 01:09:42,899
situations we might use

1838
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:45,600
um the fidelities and then if you had a

1839
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:46,920
hot spot you would use something like we

1840
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,440
usually use lace wings but you could

1841
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:51,000
also use ladybugs just to clean up that

1842
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,960
hot spot which would be a very small

1843
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,760
amount because the where where ladybugs

1844
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,100
outshine some of the other bio controls

1845
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,260
is for instance aphids they

1846
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:03,420
hoop out like a honeydew so when they're

1847
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:05,280
eating all the plants they they're

1848
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,659
constantly excreting this kind of sticky

1849
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,198
substance

1850
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:12,000
um which is just their excrement and

1851
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:13,619
that kind of if you ever see like a

1852
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,600
nasty aphid spot the whole plant will

1853
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:17,279
kind of glistening it's this honeydew

1854
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,380
that they're secreting well that

1855
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,300
honeydew a lot of the bio controls don't

1856
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:22,560
like because they've got to like they

1857
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,060
get it on them and they get to spend all

1858
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,039
their time cleaning the Honeydew off

1859
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:28,140
instead of actually cleaning up your

1860
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:30,119
pests but ladybugs and others and

1861
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:32,760
lacewings they like it like they just

1862
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:35,158
get right in there so other bio controls

1863
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,739
don't really get into those really nasty

1864
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:40,439
hot spots but ladybugs or lacewings do

1865
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:42,479
so that's kind of your place but for the

1866
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:44,158
average like honestly if I was a

1867
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,839
commercial cannabis place I honestly

1868
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,639
wouldn't even use that like not that's

1869
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,500
that's little how little I think they

1870
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,140
actually have a place

1871
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:54,179
no what a brilliant explanation you've

1872
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,980
helped me to sort of piece together many

1873
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:57,719
of the little thoughts I've had about

1874
01:10:55,979 --> 01:11:00,178
ladybugs over the years so that that's

1875
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:03,539
great thank you so much and sort of

1876
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:05,880
another topic which I often hear raised

1877
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:09,300
in the discussion of IPM is that it's

1878
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,819
often only regularly discussed by the

1879
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:13,800
people I talk to who are sort of indoor

1880
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:15,899
but now that there's a much bigger

1881
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,880
growing Market of people who are able to

1882
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:20,279
venture into the outdoor because of

1883
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,319
changing legalities in their local areas

1884
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:24,960
things like that I guess it sort of

1885
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:27,599
raises the question of how do you make

1886
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,000
selections between the use of predators

1887
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,579
in indoor versus outdoor and I guess the

1888
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,560
primary aspect I'm interested in is that

1889
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,819
whenever I talk to people about using it

1890
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,920
in Outdoors there's sort of this

1891
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:40,139
perception that the bugs will just

1892
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,000
disappear into the local environment

1893
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,739
whereas indoor you know like it's in a

1894
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,779
tent and they're gonna stay there so to

1895
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:47,218
speak do you think that's a bit of a

1896
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:51,019
misconception are you able to

1897
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:51,020
effectively use Predators Outdoors

1898
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,980
um it's not a misconception it's not

1899
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,359
entirely true so the so basically it

1900
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:59,039
depends on which Predator you're using

1901
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,079
so if any of the Predator might you can

1902
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:02,100
definitely use them Outdoors um they've

1903
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:03,840
been used

1904
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,340
um like I said one of our some of our

1905
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,539
largest you know business through our

1906
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:08,039
time has been

1907
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:09,840
um in outdoor strawberries like in

1908
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:11,939
California and Florida that's been

1909
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,159
standard for decades using predator

1910
01:12:11,939 --> 01:12:17,519
mites Outdoors for

1911
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:19,679
um broad might and Spiderman control so

1912
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,840
predator mites they can't fly right so

1913
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,699
they're stuck wherever you put them so

1914
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,199
you might have a predator Mite that

1915
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:28,139
doesn't like the environment and doesn't

1916
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:31,198
do very well in it but generally if you

1917
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:32,640
put a predator mic that does well in

1918
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,079
that environment

1919
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,980
um they do fine they're not going

1920
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,559
anywhere you don't need to worry about

1921
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:38,819
that so that's definitely not true when

1922
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,960
it comes to Predator events you can use

1923
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:42,000
them exactly how you're going to use

1924
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,340
them indoors and if the environment is

1925
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,738
correct for them they're fine when you

1926
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,719
get into some of the flying

1927
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:50,519
um Predators then that's a very

1928
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,198
different story which I would say nobody

1929
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,179
anyone that tells you they know exactly

1930
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:56,099
what the answer is to that I would say

1931
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:57,719
they're probably full of it

1932
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:00,420
um so there's a there's a lot of stuff

1933
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:02,819
going on out there so how a lot of

1934
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,859
predators

1935
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:06,539
um

1936
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:08,880
like parasite wash and stuff work is

1937
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:10,500
they actually smell

1938
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,600
um when pet when plants are under attack

1939
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,819
they actually kind of let off like a

1940
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,340
pheromone type of thing so there's like

1941
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:18,059
a scent plume coming from

1942
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,980
um

1943
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,679
let's say you got a haze plant that's

1944
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:24,839
got whatever aphids or spider mites it's

1945
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:26,219
letting off a plume of this like alarm

1946
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,920
set

1947
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:31,500
um which is there to attract

1948
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,539
um the Predators and some predators are

1949
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,420
very tuned to that so they will you know

1950
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:40,019
follow that plume which can travel for

1951
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:41,579
really a long way and that's how they

1952
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,440
find the best that they need to feed on

1953
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:46,679
so the problem is when you're going

1954
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:48,119
outside let's say you know you've got an

1955
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:52,859
aphid you're releasing something for

1956
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:55,500
aphids well are they attracted to you

1957
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:57,119
know they might get distracted by you

1958
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,279
know the scent plume coming from a tree

1959
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,979
in the nearby field or maybe not like if

1960
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:05,158
it's so nobody really knows like I've

1961
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:06,718
definitely seen outdoors in in cannabis

1962
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:09,658
and other crops where that type of stuff

1963
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,399
did work I think it's just it's kind of

1964
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:12,658
hit or miss you really don't know so you

1965
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:16,439
could release something that's going to

1966
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:18,299
fly into an aphid spot and then they're

1967
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:19,799
you know just spreading around your crop

1968
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:22,140
or they might like some other aphid

1969
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,460
species it's just a really they might

1970
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,780
like some other aphid species on a

1971
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,579
different crop better it's just a really

1972
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:29,340
complex subject that I don't think

1973
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:31,079
anybody really knows so the other thing

1974
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,360
with Outdoors is the pest Dynamic is

1975
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:35,158
very different at least in Canada so we

1976
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,359
really don't have any of the pests that

1977
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:39,899
we're dealing with like thrips really

1978
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:41,639
haven't proven to be an issue outdoors I

1979
01:14:39,899 --> 01:14:43,379
haven't really seen spider mites be an

1980
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,679
issue outdoors I think they could be in

1981
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:48,359
some environments when it's drier maybe

1982
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:50,219
I've seen a little bit of rust it might

1983
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:52,920
but basically a lot of the pest and

1984
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:54,060
images is completely different than what

1985
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,920
like there's not necessarily a

1986
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,360
biocontrol solution so the main thing

1987
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,940
that we've been doing on outdoor

1988
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,079
cannabis is actually lace Wings because

1989
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:03,419
the other thing you get into Outdoors

1990
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:05,279
it's a lot lower value crop in

1991
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,260
especially in Canada most of it's just

1992
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:08,460
going into the extract market so first

1993
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,780
of all they've got a higher tolerance

1994
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:13,939
for pest levels because they're just

1995
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:13,939
turning into isolate or something and

1996
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:18,960
um and you also get natural predators

1997
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:21,120
are coming in too right so

1998
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,739
out there the kind of strategy that

1999
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:23,880
we've seen is like the biggest issue

2000
01:15:22,738 --> 01:15:26,279
that we've seen that we actually have a

2001
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,840
solution for is cannabis aphid and

2002
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:29,880
usually that's a self-induced condition

2003
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,860
where people have had cannabis aphid on

2004
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,600
their clones that they put in that they

2005
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:34,920
had inside and then they put them

2006
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,980
outside and expression now you've got

2007
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:40,980
cannabis safe and outside so what we've

2008
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:42,779
kind of been doing is seeding with

2009
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:44,939
lace-wing eggs so lacing eggs are kind

2010
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:47,399
of an inexpensive version of lace wings

2011
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:49,559
and we kind of see the whole crop a

2012
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:51,539
couple of times with lace Wing eggs with

2013
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,980
the idea that even though lacewings are

2014
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:54,719
probably going to show up naturally

2015
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,359
outdoors they might not show up until

2016
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:59,819
like August where we can put them in

2017
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:02,158
June 1st and then they start cycling in

2018
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:03,899
the crop earlier and that seems to be I

2019
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,359
mean it makes sense from a science level

2020
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:08,039
and it seems to have worked but a lot of

2021
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:11,460
the outdoor stuff on cannabis is really

2022
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:14,939
it's Uncharted Territory

2023
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:17,340
yeah fantastic response and yeah it

2024
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:19,500
seems like a good way to sort of

2025
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,640
um you know control aphid problems

2026
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,140
outside

2027
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,119
it makes me think you know there's so

2028
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:26,340
many different types of predators and

2029
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:29,219
there's many different formulation types

2030
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:30,539
be it you know sometimes it's you know

2031
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:32,640
maybe Predators spread amongst

2032
01:16:30,539 --> 01:16:35,158
vermiculite I've had Predators arrive

2033
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,079
that are sort of on actively on the

2034
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,119
leaves of another product and ready to

2035
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:42,119
jump on to your crop things like that

2036
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:44,039
you get sachets how do you know what's

2037
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:46,640
the best one for you in any given

2038
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:46,640
situation

2039
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,760
um

2040
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:54,599
that's when and for most situations is

2041
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:56,280
usually sachets so the sachets are kind

2042
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,480
of like the evolution I think a lot of

2043
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:59,219
people don't cry this like the evolution

2044
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:01,319
of Bio controls it all kind of started

2045
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:03,840
off on bean leaves for instance that

2046
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:06,179
that person for instance persimilus so

2047
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,100
persimmona started off by being reared

2048
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:09,300
on bean leaves and people would sell you

2049
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,219
know you get a bean leaf with some

2050
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,719
persimulus on it it's also usually got

2051
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:14,219
some spider mites on it because by

2052
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,600
default you got to have spider nights

2053
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:18,239
there and you and sometimes some other

2054
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,739
pests so then from there that evolved

2055
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:21,359
into

2056
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:22,979
um having whole greenhouses where they

2057
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:26,339
would rear

2058
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:27,919
a crop it's usually done on bean plants

2059
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:30,659
um and then they would

2060
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,119
have infested with spider mites then

2061
01:17:30,658 --> 01:17:35,099
they would infest that with persimulus

2062
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,279
and then there's a special extraction

2063
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:40,560
technique where you can basically vacuum

2064
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:42,238
off the just the persimmas and leave the

2065
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,760
spider mites behind

2066
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:48,599
so and then the latest technology which

2067
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:50,880
which we've just developed this year is

2068
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,860
um rearing it on a fictitious host so

2069
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,300
something other than fictitious host

2070
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:57,779
just means something other than its

2071
01:17:54,300 --> 01:18:00,659
natural prey source so we just figured

2072
01:17:57,779 --> 01:18:01,920
out um that this year's how to do that

2073
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:04,379
so then you don't have any risk of

2074
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,779
introducing spider mites

2075
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:09,719
um you it's a lot more standardized

2076
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:13,019
production and you can actually get

2077
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:15,000
better results because you can ship them

2078
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,380
with food so they've got a higher for

2079
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,140
gun to do which means they can lay more

2080
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:21,000
eggs in the crop so anytime when you're

2081
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:23,400
buying stuff on bean leaves you're like

2082
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,158
going back a couple of decades so kind

2083
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:28,079
of the evolution was being leaves with

2084
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:30,000
on the in the case of persimulus or

2085
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,399
other stuff would have been

2086
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,859
for other types of mice like for

2087
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,259
instance cucamaris or swarovsky they're

2088
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:40,019
californicus they're reared on

2089
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:41,699
a fictitious host so it's usually a

2090
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:44,719
brand might which is kind of like a it's

2091
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:47,698
just a Mite that feeds on brand and

2092
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:49,198
basically they're reared in climate

2093
01:18:47,698 --> 01:18:50,939
rooms

2094
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:53,279
with bran

2095
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:55,198
than the brand might it's eating the

2096
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:57,719
brand and then the Swarovski or the

2097
01:18:55,198 --> 01:19:00,419
Cucumbers is eating the feeder knife so

2098
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:02,279
kind of the first you know wave of Bio

2099
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:03,899
control was just selling that loose so

2100
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,158
you'd buy the brand with the feeder Mite

2101
01:19:03,899 --> 01:19:07,198
and the

2102
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:09,179
um square feet on it

2103
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:10,799
um the vermiculate they're talking was

2104
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:12,719
actually evolved from that so

2105
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,579
vermiculate is a way to get rid of the

2106
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,198
feeder mites so some crops are really

2107
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:18,238
sensitive to those feeder mites they can

2108
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:21,539
damage certain crops

2109
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:24,000
um so they would filter the feeder mites

2110
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:25,738
out and put them on vermiculite so there

2111
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,899
was no food source for the feeder right

2112
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:29,639
so that's really the only reason to use

2113
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:31,198
something on vermiculate

2114
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,980
for predator mics it's different with

2115
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:36,658
other uh with other bios would be if you

2116
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,279
get a crop that's sensitive to feeder

2117
01:19:36,658 --> 01:19:39,599
mites which cannabis isn't and we don't

2118
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:43,259
even use that type of feeder right that

2119
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,120
causes damage anymore or

2120
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:46,619
for ornamentals where you don't want the

2121
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,899
carrier like let's say you're growing

2122
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:50,698
poinsettias or cannabis would be the

2123
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:52,799
same let's say you're putting a loose

2124
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:54,238
application of bran on your cannabis and

2125
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,820
then maybe you're doing a foliar spray

2126
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:58,439
well that sticks that brand Like Glue to

2127
01:19:56,819 --> 01:19:59,880
your leaf or your butt or whatever and

2128
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:02,039
then a lot of times it molds and it's

2129
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,079
like a contamination issue so it was

2130
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:06,060
traditionally ornamental Growers would

2131
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:08,340
use that vermiculite product so it

2132
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:11,340
didn't stick to the plant

2133
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:13,140
so then the final evolution was these

2134
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:15,000
sachets so what a sachet is it's

2135
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:17,520
basically taking that breeding system

2136
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,140
the brand the brand mites and the feeder

2137
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,440
and the actual Predator might you want

2138
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:24,840
and putting it into basically a little

2139
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:27,299
envelope just kind of keeps the humidity

2140
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,760
up in it so it keeps like a breeding

2141
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,920
system going so

2142
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,940
um or rather than if you put loose

2143
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,920
material in your crop you're just

2144
01:20:32,939 --> 01:20:36,839
getting whatever was in that bottle and

2145
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:40,199
then whatever reproduces in the crop

2146
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,819
with sachets it's releasing like for

2147
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:43,439
instance the regular sachets that we

2148
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:46,819
would use in canvas they usually last

2149
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:50,299
about four weeks so they're constantly

2150
01:20:46,819 --> 01:20:54,539
releasing predator mites into the crop

2151
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:57,060
so that's for sure always the vast

2152
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:58,500
majority of cases sachets are hands down

2153
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:00,539
the better way to go you don't get

2154
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,979
contamination of material into your crop

2155
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:04,500
because it's contained in the sachet

2156
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:06,658
it's far cheaper because it's breeding

2157
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:09,658
itself and you're just getting a

2158
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:11,460
continued release another reason is what

2159
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:14,519
specifically on cannabis why the sachets

2160
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:16,920
are really a good idea is because in

2161
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:19,800
order for predator mites to reproduce

2162
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:22,380
they lay their eggs on specialized plant

2163
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,880
hair so kind of like a trichome

2164
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,840
um and people with cannabis probably

2165
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,039
aren't you know exactly what I'm talking

2166
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,319
about because canvas doesn't really have

2167
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:29,819
the type of trichome that they like so

2168
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:32,039
imagine you know a cannabis it's got

2169
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:33,238
like the glandular stocked trichome and

2170
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:35,158
then I think they're called capitate

2171
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:37,799
sessile ones which is just like kind of

2172
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:39,479
like a little hair so they like to lay

2173
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,300
their eggs on something similar to like

2174
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:45,178
a cavity specile trichoma just like a

2175
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,679
thin plant hair and canvas doesn't

2176
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:48,719
really have a lot of them it's like

2177
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:50,340
they're very specific about the size and

2178
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,679
everything so I wouldn't say you don't

2179
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,600
get any reproduction on cannabis but you

2180
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:58,079
get really low compared to a lot of

2181
01:21:54,600 --> 01:22:00,060
plants like a swarce will reproduce way

2182
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:03,119
better on like a cucumber plant or a

2183
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:04,860
pepper plant than it will on cannabis so

2184
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:06,539
because it's not really reproducing that

2185
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:08,099
well you really want to be having a

2186
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:09,539
constant source of them releasing into

2187
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,760
your crop so that's where the sachets

2188
01:22:09,539 --> 01:22:13,859
really are to me a hands down because

2189
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,900
did you you hang in your crop once

2190
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:19,019
they're giving you continual release

2191
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:22,019
into the crop for four weeks

2192
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:23,880
wow yeah really comprehensive answer and

2193
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,460
you touched on a few things I'd love to

2194
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:29,760
segue into so that that's perfect and

2195
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:32,579
you know it sort of using the the sachet

2196
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:35,100
Innovation as a springboard something

2197
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:36,960
else I noticed that you guys are doing

2198
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,880
really well which I haven't really seen

2199
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,520
many other places in terms of innovation

2200
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,679
is the the feeding sachets

2201
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,199
and I had a few questions around them I

2202
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:49,020
guess most notably uh you know sort of

2203
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:52,319
at the Forefront of my mind is are these

2204
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:54,900
feeding sachets sort of something to

2205
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:57,779
help you bridge the current Predator

2206
01:22:54,899 --> 01:23:00,299
armor you've got to say you know a few

2207
01:22:57,779 --> 01:23:03,000
weeks ahead or are they able to be used

2208
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:04,860
sort of indefinitely and if someone had

2209
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,779
purchased you know a reasonable size

2210
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:08,880
amount of predators they might be able

2211
01:23:06,779 --> 01:23:10,979
to sustain a pretty good percentage of

2212
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,199
that population over the long term with

2213
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:15,539
regular feed sachet use

2214
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:17,339
and we do have one type for prisimless

2215
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:19,140
which is just a release sachet which is

2216
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,400
just it's literally just to stop the

2217
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:23,039
carrier from getting in the crop if

2218
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:25,019
you're in flour all the other ones are

2219
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:27,119
breeding sachets so they've got the food

2220
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,800
and everything in there

2221
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:30,960
um so they're that that's what's

2222
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,480
happening is it's for all the food is in

2223
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,819
that sachet and it's like a it's a life

2224
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,339
just it's a life cycle in there so the

2225
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:39,719
prey mites it's cycling in there and

2226
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:42,539
constantly coming out so there's no such

2227
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:44,158
thing as like a feeder sachet there is

2228
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:46,979
like some

2229
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:49,139
um sometimes we'll put in it's not a big

2230
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:50,698
part of the industry but there's two

2231
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:52,980
things you can do on top of that which

2232
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:54,779
maybe I think you're maybe thinking of

2233
01:23:52,979 --> 01:23:58,198
is where you're actually putting some

2234
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:59,340
food in the crop for the predator mites

2235
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:02,339
to

2236
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,079
it boosts the numbers so you can put we

2237
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,520
generally use again those feeder mites

2238
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:07,500
we'll just sell bottles of just those

2239
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:11,460
feeder mites and put them in the crop

2240
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:13,738
and that works because it's uh so this

2241
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:16,560
feeder mites there's pollen and there's

2242
01:24:13,738 --> 01:24:18,479
some other stuff like like our team our

2243
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,699
team in which is kind of like a brine

2244
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:24,238
shrimp different feeding sources I'm

2245
01:24:20,698 --> 01:24:26,698
generally not a big believer in them on

2246
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:28,919
especially on cannabis because they I

2247
01:24:26,698 --> 01:24:31,439
don't find they're needed a ton on that

2248
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,060
crop and they also are a big source of

2249
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:34,859
contaminants so to me I'm like when

2250
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,600
you're putting brine shrimp on something

2251
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:37,859
like that at the end of the day like

2252
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,260
somebody smelling might have a shellfish

2253
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:41,939
allergy I don't know but it's a source

2254
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,980
of potential contamination and the same

2255
01:24:41,939 --> 01:24:44,698
with pollen so all that pollen that

2256
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:46,979
people

2257
01:24:44,698 --> 01:24:50,579
will use on it first of all it can feed

2258
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:53,218
thrips so you're also feeding

2259
01:24:50,579 --> 01:24:54,359
um the pest where so that's not a good

2260
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:56,460
thing

2261
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:58,019
um okay it's a complicated issue there's

2262
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,880
some situations where I'd say that is a

2263
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:04,140
good idea most of the time I'd say no

2264
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:06,119
when why we prefer just using the

2265
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:08,760
um the feeder mice is because it doesn't

2266
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:11,698
feed the pests so as first gear or

2267
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:14,400
cucamaris it nutritionally is a lot

2268
01:25:11,698 --> 01:25:15,599
better for it to eat protein than a like

2269
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:16,799
it's going to make it reproduce better

2270
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,039
and then you don't have to worry about a

2271
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,699
thrift thrips is an AEP beater might

2272
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:22,079
um

2273
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:23,399
so I think that's maybe what you're

2274
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:25,198
thinking but there's also some other for

2275
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:27,238
some other bios there's like cards and

2276
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:28,919
stuff that can hang in the crop I'm I

2277
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:31,678
said I personally am not a big believer

2278
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,300
on with it on cannabis for a bunch of

2279
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:35,520
reasons the other thing you gotta

2280
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,980
remember with pollen is all that pollen

2281
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,800
mostly comes from China and wherever it

2282
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:43,859
comes from so it's cocktail pollen and

2283
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:46,260
the pesticide residue not that they're

2284
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:48,000
spraying it but like most stuff has

2285
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,980
pesticide residue like maybe it's close

2286
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,719
to an agricultural crop or whatever it

2287
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:52,859
goes through the water table

2288
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:54,539
um so you never know what you're

2289
01:25:52,859 --> 01:25:56,039
actually introducing into your crop like

2290
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:57,960
when you're getting residue testing if

2291
01:25:56,039 --> 01:25:59,639
you're putting pollen out there you know

2292
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:02,340
and pollen quite often can have

2293
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:04,380
pesticide residue in it in some level so

2294
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,819
I think that's probably what you're

2295
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:08,039
mistaken but

2296
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:10,079
um yeah sachets is just generally a

2297
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:11,639
sachet is a breeding sachet and that's a

2298
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:13,679
system on its own

2299
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:15,900
yeah no thank you for the clarification

2300
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,158
I think I had read about Brian shrimp

2301
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:18,238
when you were talking about but yeah

2302
01:26:17,158 --> 01:26:20,399
that you answered the question

2303
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,439
nevertheless so thank you very much and

2304
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:25,079
I mean while we're on the topic of crop

2305
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:27,259
contamination something I had heard from

2306
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:30,000
primarily soilless Growers actually

2307
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:32,520
whenever the topic of predators were

2308
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,679
raised was that it sort of always came

2309
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,080
across as this sort of contrarian thing

2310
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:39,119
to say in my opinion but they would say

2311
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:41,579
oh you know yeah predator mites but

2312
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:43,500
don't they just eat the bad predators

2313
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:45,420
and then they still poo on the plan and

2314
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:48,600
then that's contamination blah blah blah

2315
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:50,520
I had never really heard of this being a

2316
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,699
meaningful issue or something that had

2317
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:56,340
sort of been considered a realistic

2318
01:26:53,698 --> 01:26:58,439
detract and from using predators and

2319
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:00,239
then it also negates the point that

2320
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:01,859
you've gotten rid of the infestation

2321
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:04,859
which is you know sort of the number one

2322
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:06,960
goal what's your view on that sort of

2323
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:08,639
opinion that even Predators will put

2324
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,980
excrement on the plant is it something

2325
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,659
you think there's any real Merit to

2326
01:27:10,979 --> 01:27:14,939
worrying about it's more of a

2327
01:27:12,658 --> 01:27:18,119
superficial concern to a meaningful

2328
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:19,619
solution to an actual bug infestation

2329
01:27:18,119 --> 01:27:21,658
I think that would be another one the

2330
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:24,899
answer would be both um it can be a

2331
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:26,579
issue I would say it's not generally

2332
01:27:24,899 --> 01:27:28,259
issue it's like anything you have to use

2333
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:30,899
stuff correctly if it's used correctly

2334
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,179
it's a non-issue so I would first of all

2335
01:27:30,899 --> 01:27:34,799
caveat like Canada for anyone like

2336
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:37,319
that's not familiar with it's probably

2337
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,579
the most regulated cannabis Market in

2338
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:40,799
the world because it's always been

2339
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:42,479
regulated not always but since it's been

2340
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,119
legal it's been regulated on a federal

2341
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:48,000
level by the government so it's it's on

2342
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:51,059
kind of ridiculous how regulated the

2343
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
market is so everything is like as far

2344
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:55,380
as contaminants

2345
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I would say we 100 have the most

2346
01:27:55,380 --> 01:28:00,239
regulated market that comes from that

2347
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,219
and it is essentially never come up the

2348
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:07,198
only time I've ever seen it come up

2349
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:09,480
which was issues when it was both the

2350
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:11,819
past there was pest in the crop that was

2351
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:13,678
contaminating it and yes there was bios

2352
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:15,779
in the crop also that was eating the

2353
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,039
pest so I'd say well does it really make

2354
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:20,519
a difference whether you've got spider

2355
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:22,920
mites and for stimulus in your

2356
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:24,960
contamination or just Spider-Mans it's

2357
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:27,300
the same thing so where I would so I'd

2358
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,579
say mostly it's a non-issue but I do

2359
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:32,219
think it is a potential issue so I'd say

2360
01:28:29,579 --> 01:28:33,420
if you've got pests in the crop anyways

2361
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:35,399
I don't think it really makes any

2362
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:37,079
difference but a lot of the cases like

2363
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:40,079
we're trying not to have pests in there

2364
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:43,319
so that's when you really have to have a

2365
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:45,359
strategy when you go about it so the the

2366
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:47,639
issue with those sachets that you need

2367
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:49,019
to be aware about so most stuff it's not

2368
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:50,520
going to reproducing the crop unless

2369
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:52,500
it's got it passed for instance like if

2370
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,960
you put for stimulus in a spider mite

2371
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:57,539
crop or in a spider-made infested crop

2372
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,340
where stimulus will keep reproducing in

2373
01:28:57,539 --> 01:29:01,139
the crop as long as there's spider mites

2374
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:02,940
there within about a week of there being

2375
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:06,139
no spider mites they disappear it

2376
01:29:02,939 --> 01:29:09,359
cannibalizes itself and it's gone so

2377
01:29:06,139 --> 01:29:12,719
that's really a non-issue but when you

2378
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:14,460
get breeding sachets it can be an issue

2379
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,319
because then it's giving a source of

2380
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:18,840
food so that sachet basically you hang

2381
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:20,399
that in your crop it's releasing feeder

2382
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:24,179
mites and predator mites in your crop

2383
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:26,039
for about four weeks so when with our

2384
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:29,340
program we always front load something

2385
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:31,439
so for instance in cannabis for like

2386
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:34,500
swersky or californicus we would only

2387
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:36,599
ever put sachets in like right when your

2388
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,639
crops going into flowering that's kind

2389
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,560
of like you do once the start of veg

2390
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,300
basically like let's say you're vegging

2391
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,340
for three weeks you're gonna put sachets

2392
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:46,020
in then to cover your veg area you put

2393
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,699
them into flour you put another round of

2394
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:50,520
sachets in because the first ones would

2395
01:29:47,698 --> 01:29:52,319
have expired and then that's going to

2396
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,000
kind of protect you up until your buds

2397
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:56,279
start to stack you know for three or

2398
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,198
four weeks what you don't and I do see

2399
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:00,300
people do this sometimes what you really

2400
01:29:58,198 --> 01:30:03,479
don't want to do is be hanging them like

2401
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:05,159
in week four and then you've got sachets

2402
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:07,619
that are releasing right until week

2403
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:09,479
eight well 100 you are going to get not

2404
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:12,420
just fecal matter contamination but

2405
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:14,158
actual might contamination is it a big

2406
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:15,359
issue not really I don't think most of

2407
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:16,799
the time you'll even see it but I

2408
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,619
personally wouldn't do it to me like you

2409
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,520
really want to finish that you know the

2410
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:22,559
last

2411
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:24,000
half of your crop with nothing in it

2412
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,699
like there should be no pest there there

2413
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,779
should be no bio controls you know so so

2414
01:30:26,698 --> 01:30:29,579
it's like one of the things it's people

2415
01:30:27,779 --> 01:30:32,639
blow it up the way people talk about it

2416
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:35,519
I'd say that's really not an issue yes

2417
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:38,039
the Predator might poop absolutely still

2418
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,480
to pass like so it's it's one of those

2419
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:41,819
things you just need to time the

2420
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:45,359
applications properly and it's and it's

2421
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:47,639
a non-issue yeah a great answer there I

2422
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:50,219
guess as you mentioned in an Ideal World

2423
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:51,960
the second half of the the fruiting the

2424
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:54,420
flowering phase there's sort of ideal

2425
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,219
conditions but in a sort of more

2426
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:58,520
realistic world one of the questions

2427
01:30:56,219 --> 01:31:02,520
which time and time again comes up is

2428
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:04,800
how do I fight off an infestation that

2429
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,659
I've only just realized is there like

2430
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:09,119
week four week five you know so you're

2431
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:10,738
on that second half you know it's a

2432
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:12,719
tough question I understand but I guess

2433
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:15,178
I'm always interested how would you

2434
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:17,939
personally go about tackling say a mind

2435
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:21,239
infestation that really only been picked

2436
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:23,460
up around week four week five of flower

2437
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:25,379
yeah there's not a great answer for that

2438
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:29,119
because there it's one of those things

2439
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:31,219
that this can Will bios do

2440
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:33,719
help you there

2441
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:36,060
yes can they turn again if we're talking

2442
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:38,158
about Spider-Man specifically you're

2443
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:40,199
really that's getting to the point where

2444
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,359
it's the point of no return so what

2445
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:43,678
happens with Predator mice is because

2446
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:45,059
they're you know they live on the

2447
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,260
underside of the leaf primarily there's

2448
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,580
walking around the leaves like that's

2449
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:48,239
how they hunt

2450
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:50,039
um

2451
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:51,718
and they'll walk like if you put a

2452
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:53,639
predator might on you know one leaf

2453
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:54,719
it'll walk up the whole plant walk to

2454
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:57,920
the next Plant if the leaves are

2455
01:31:54,719 --> 01:32:00,420
touching like they get around but like

2456
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,679
the you know trichomes that's what

2457
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:04,020
they're there for is to protect the

2458
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,179
plants against bugs right so predator

2459
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,739
mites they'll get stuck in the trichomes

2460
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:09,600
like it's toxic to them they get stuck

2461
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:10,919
physically get stuck to it

2462
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,500
um you know the terpenes probably in

2463
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,300
some varieties are anti you know they're

2464
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,960
probably mitochondyl

2465
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,000
um

2466
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,500
and also just a buzz just from a

2467
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,880
physical like when you get you know a

2468
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,520
dense butt a predator might can't

2469
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,260
literally walk through it so let's say

2470
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,580
you have spider mites I see this is a

2471
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,860
pretty common problem where somebody

2472
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:30,179
doesn't

2473
01:32:27,859 --> 01:32:31,979
they don't pay attention

2474
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:34,260
all sudden they're like holy cow I got

2475
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:35,939
spider mites and it's weak sticks or

2476
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,800
something like that and then they want

2477
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:39,299
to put stuff on well like you basically

2478
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,340
have to put the persimilates on every

2479
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:44,880
leaf you want it because it can't walk

2480
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:46,679
through the buzz so there's some tricks

2481
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:49,139
that you can kind of like you can do it

2482
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:51,480
but like so on a home Garden it's

2483
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:53,520
doable on a commercial Garden it's

2484
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:55,379
pretty much impossible because you just

2485
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:57,480
like that's bio control you're relying

2486
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:58,980
on the bio control to do the work for

2487
01:32:57,479 --> 01:33:00,899
you of walking through the crop and

2488
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:02,399
finding the pests and they just can't do

2489
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:05,279
it anymore

2490
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:06,479
um so there's stuff you can do but a lot

2491
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:07,859
of that time you're really getting into

2492
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:10,198
physical controls like you're getting

2493
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:12,599
into you know wiping the leaves with

2494
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:14,939
moist cloths or you know in commercial

2495
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,199
really your only option is you know you

2496
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:18,299
could spray them a bit with water to

2497
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:19,619
break them up and the main option is

2498
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,360
physical removal just going through

2499
01:33:19,619 --> 01:33:23,099
deleting this stuff and hoping for the

2500
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,238
best there's really people want to hear

2501
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:26,100
there's a great solution the great

2502
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,359
solution is pay attention to your crop

2503
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,880
earlier on because you didn't just get

2504
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,719
spider mites in week four this doesn't

2505
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:33,779
happen

2506
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:35,520
yeah 100 100 and I guess that's one of

2507
01:33:33,779 --> 01:33:36,899
the reasons why you know we sort of

2508
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,540
advocate you know spend time with your

2509
01:33:36,899 --> 01:33:43,198
plants you'll pick up on these things I

2510
01:33:39,539 --> 01:33:45,779
guess one of the options people would

2511
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:47,698
maybe consider as you sort of referenced

2512
01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:50,519
it that uh week four week five

2513
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:53,279
infestation stages they might think oh

2514
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,080
I've got to spray with something uh

2515
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:57,539
what's your what's your thoughts on neem

2516
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:59,760
oil I I think something which I've heard

2517
01:33:57,539 --> 01:34:01,139
of a little bit is there's maybe a

2518
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,000
little bit of a misconception like

2519
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:04,920
people get predators and then they spray

2520
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,319
neem oil and I'm like oh I think you're

2521
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:08,880
killing the Predators there

2522
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:11,279
um it doesn't really seem to be clear

2523
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,840
consensus in some people's minds what's

2524
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:14,460
your thoughts on neem oil and would you

2525
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,980
ever use it in the presence of already

2526
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:18,960
released predators

2527
01:34:16,979 --> 01:34:21,599
um I think neem oil probably has a place

2528
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,939
I've definitely I've used it long long

2529
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,560
ago we run into it a fair bit I

2530
01:34:23,939 --> 01:34:28,019
generally steer away from it and in

2531
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:29,760
Canada in Canada neem oil for reasons

2532
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:30,900
Beyond me is really highly regulated so

2533
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,980
it doesn't actually come up like you're

2534
01:34:30,899 --> 01:34:34,319
not allowed to use it you're only

2535
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:36,059
allowed to sell it so I have had a fair

2536
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:38,219
bit of experience with people using it

2537
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:40,620
so I'd rather than focus on neem I would

2538
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:44,279
say just generally any type of Botanical

2539
01:34:40,619 --> 01:34:48,539
is a good idea to stay away from with

2540
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:50,880
bio control so I I let's say two things

2541
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:53,340
one I've never seen anybody actually

2542
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:55,679
control pests properly with them people

2543
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:58,619
all swear by it but they still all have

2544
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,880
spider mites or thrips and neem is

2545
01:34:58,619 --> 01:35:03,539
definitely a powerful tool I mean we

2546
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:06,239
both know that in certain situations

2547
01:35:03,539 --> 01:35:07,760
um in specifically in using it with bio

2548
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:10,619
control

2549
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:13,079
most and again most of our business is

2550
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:14,819
in conventional agriculture so we've got

2551
01:35:13,079 --> 01:35:16,859
a lot of experience with side effects

2552
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:19,559
like the side effects of pesticides of

2553
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:22,859
all kinds on beneficial insects

2554
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,360
every time not every time that most a

2555
01:35:22,859 --> 01:35:26,759
lot of our problems when you come into

2556
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:29,039
side effects on beneficials come from

2557
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,420
Botanicals that Botanicals have a just

2558
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:32,340
like they're having an effect on your

2559
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,100
mice of some level they're also having

2560
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:37,739
an effect on your Predator lights so I

2561
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:40,320
generally steer clear of them completely

2562
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:42,779
um not just mean to rule it out I my

2563
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:43,859
personal view is I'm big on like if I

2564
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:45,658
want to spray I'm going to eat like

2565
01:35:43,859 --> 01:35:47,579
soaps work great if you use them well

2566
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:49,259
soap is just like the second it's dry

2567
01:35:47,579 --> 01:35:51,539
you can put predators in there's no

2568
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:53,520
residual like they're good to go same

2569
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:56,460
with some of the

2570
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:59,100
um the fungus like the Bavaria and stuff

2571
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:02,460
like that uh entomopathogenic fungi

2572
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:04,079
those are generally useful I personally

2573
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:05,579
like after like I said I've kind of

2574
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,139
grown up around all of it I've grown up

2575
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:09,359
around the Canada scene I've grown up

2576
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:11,039
around big commercial greenhouses where

2577
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:13,380
they spray a lot of peptides and I've

2578
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:15,600
grown up around Culper where we use a

2579
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:18,119
lot of Bio control I personally on

2580
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,920
cannabis would almost never spray like

2581
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:24,238
that's one of the things that

2582
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:25,619
people I really in the majority of

2583
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:26,519
situations I would never sorry for a

2584
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:28,079
past and I'm not just saying that

2585
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,780
because I sell bio control I honestly

2586
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:33,119
think you'll get better control with bio

2587
01:36:30,779 --> 01:36:34,859
control than you will with sprays most

2588
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:35,519
of the time

2589
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:37,559
um

2590
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,540
it's one of the big myths I find in BIO

2591
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:42,420
control is people really underestimate

2592
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:44,880
how strong bio control and they is and

2593
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:47,158
they overestimate how strong some magic

2594
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:50,159
potion is

2595
01:36:47,158 --> 01:36:52,500
yeah a brilliant answer I you sort of

2596
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:54,299
touched on just the topic just in your

2597
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,579
answer you know sort of Bio control

2598
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:58,440
myths I'd be interested to hear are

2599
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:00,000
there any other sort of common bio

2600
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:02,719
control myths that you find yourself

2601
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,719
dealing with

2602
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,659
um probably I mean that's a big one is

2603
01:37:04,979 --> 01:37:08,099
just that people really underestimate

2604
01:37:06,658 --> 01:37:10,799
they really don't

2605
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:12,420
get how powerful it is like a lot of

2606
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,800
people

2607
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:15,840
um like I said I would like to use my

2608
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,940
example of when I came from copper came

2609
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,380
to covert initially I had this I had the

2610
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:21,238
same perception where I thought it was

2611
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:22,859
kind of like this you know it's it's

2612
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:24,299
good you're not you're not affecting the

2613
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:26,460
environment it probably don't work that

2614
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:28,260
well but you know you know what it's

2615
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:29,819
environmentally sound blah blah blah and

2616
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:32,280
the first literally my first day at work

2617
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:35,279
at COBRA they took me to this greenhouse

2618
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:37,439
that was just the highest

2619
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:40,920
um test pressure I've ever seen in my

2620
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:43,559
life and they had literally

2621
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:45,239
switch to buy up to almost entirely bio

2622
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,159
controls because the pesticides just

2623
01:37:45,238 --> 01:37:49,500
didn't work so not that pesticides

2624
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:51,599
didn't work they needed to use them so

2625
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,819
frequently that the past had just become

2626
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,320
resistant to them all so it was like in

2627
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:56,939
a normal situation yeah that pesticide

2628
01:37:55,319 --> 01:37:59,639
worked great if you use it once or twice

2629
01:37:56,939 --> 01:38:02,819
a year not if you're using it you know

2630
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:04,859
50 times a year and so that was really

2631
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:06,238
eye-opening to me that when you got into

2632
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:07,920
a situation like that and you're like

2633
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:09,479
wow like they're not even this is the

2634
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,460
highest pest pressure

2635
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:13,379
I've ever seen in my life and they're

2636
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,539
not even using Apex that they're

2637
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:17,520
literally just battling it with bio

2638
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:19,139
control and it's winning so that's one

2639
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,940
of the big things I think people just

2640
01:38:19,139 --> 01:38:23,100
need to wrap their head around it's

2641
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:24,419
really a strong tool

2642
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,639
um one of the other ones that comes up

2643
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:28,859
all the time is the climate so

2644
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,960
definitely people like there's

2645
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:33,839
definitely differences with

2646
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:36,060
um different bio controls have different

2647
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,520
climate preferences but people really

2648
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:41,159
over complicate this so like first of

2649
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:44,820
all like most crop plants grow in the

2650
01:38:41,158 --> 01:38:48,238
same rough you know temperature and

2651
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:51,539
relative humidity situations

2652
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:53,099
um so like you never have so people are

2653
01:38:51,539 --> 01:38:54,479
like oh I don't want to use persimmon's

2654
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:56,280
because I've got this special climate

2655
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,079
conditions I have like I said I've

2656
01:38:56,279 --> 01:38:59,880
worked here for 15 years I've basically

2657
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:01,139
never seen anyone with a special climate

2658
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,000
condition

2659
01:39:01,139 --> 01:39:04,560
um that you couldn't use bio control

2660
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,119
with one caveat if you're growing some

2661
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,639
crops nothing to do with cannabis that's

2662
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:12,000
really cold then that's a situation on

2663
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:13,199
cannabis it always works fine

2664
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,039
um

2665
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:18,599
do they work as well as they would in an

2666
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:20,279
optimized climate like for instance one

2667
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,539
of the big things is relative humidity

2668
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,779
so a lot of Predator might be really

2669
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:27,179
like a higher relative humidity

2670
01:39:24,779 --> 01:39:28,619
um so you know and you know when we're

2671
01:39:27,179 --> 01:39:30,658
finishing you know especially Indica

2672
01:39:28,619 --> 01:39:33,000
stranger going really way down like 40

2673
01:39:30,658 --> 01:39:36,479
45 relative humidity that's definitely

2674
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,760
not ideal for a predator mic

2675
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:40,738
but

2676
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:42,420
one of the uh one of the Agricultural

2677
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:44,279
research stations near where I live

2678
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:45,899
actually did a big uh like a

2679
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:48,658
peer-reviewed journal article years ago

2680
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:51,238
on this and they actually measured the

2681
01:39:48,658 --> 01:39:53,339
climate conditions on the Philo plane

2682
01:39:51,238 --> 01:39:55,138
which is the you know the immediate Leaf

2683
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:57,480
surface you know the underside of the

2684
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:59,819
leaf and what they found is that phyllo

2685
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:02,579
plane which is that's specifically where

2686
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:04,259
the Predator might is living it huge

2687
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:05,760
buffer against the environment so even

2688
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:07,320
though we're going down and again I'm

2689
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,000
making these numbers up so hold me

2690
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:10,619
verbatim to them but like let's say

2691
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,658
you're cranking your relative humidity

2692
01:40:10,619 --> 01:40:17,340
down for late flowering at like you know

2693
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:20,279
40 or 45. that phyloplane

2694
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:22,020
um climate it's probably still like 70

2695
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:25,158
or something like that like it's very

2696
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:29,460
hard to deviate to make that

2697
01:40:25,158 --> 01:40:32,099
microclimate change because they are

2698
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:33,658
because of the stomata so the first of

2699
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:36,300
all like the leaf is kind of shielding

2700
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:37,500
it from the light the stomata is one of

2701
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,420
the big things it's you know it's

2702
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,399
letting it water vapor underneath the

2703
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:43,020
leaf so in the you know we're just

2704
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:44,759
talking about you know a quarter of a

2705
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:48,659
millimeter or something like that it's

2706
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:50,340
still humid there so they it's not as

2707
01:40:48,658 --> 01:40:52,259
big of a deal as they think about it

2708
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:54,600
it's honestly something that unless your

2709
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:56,460
temperature is under like 20 or 20

2710
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,199
degrees Celsius all the time you don't

2711
01:40:56,460 --> 01:41:00,359
really need to worry about it

2712
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:00,960
um they there are people be like oh he

2713
01:41:00,359 --> 01:41:01,920
doesn't know what he's talking about

2714
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,020
there's

2715
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,179
um their eggs dehydrated at a low

2716
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:08,880
relative humidity that can sometimes be

2717
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:10,619
true for sure but you can still use bio

2718
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,359
control yes maybe it just doesn't

2719
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:14,880
reproduce as well

2720
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:17,880
um we've like I said bio control has

2721
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,500
been absolutely standard in Canada for

2722
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,819
cannabis production since the start of a

2723
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,319
legalization so I know how many years

2724
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:25,799
that is quite a few

2725
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:27,779
um it's a Well proven thing

2726
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,340
um less so in the U.S just because of a

2727
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:30,960
couple other reasons just because they

2728
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:32,699
have more pesticides and it was less

2729
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,698
regulated but for sure in Canada

2730
01:41:32,698 --> 01:41:38,339
everybody's been using cannabis

2731
01:41:35,698 --> 01:41:41,219
um or bio control on cannabis since the

2732
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:42,719
start everyone has very similar climates

2733
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:45,420
it works fine

2734
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:48,239
yeah brilliant explanation there and

2735
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:50,760
given your experience in the Canadian

2736
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:52,439
Market a question which a lot of the

2737
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:54,539
American listeners are often sort of

2738
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:56,399
interested in is what do you think will

2739
01:41:54,539 --> 01:41:59,340
be some of the biggest pest issues

2740
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:03,059
facing the Cannabis market for example

2741
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:05,579
in the US as it continues to expand and

2742
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:07,260
get bigger and more people get involved

2743
01:42:05,579 --> 01:42:09,000
yeah well is this two things the biggest

2744
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:10,800
pest issue I think is probably always is

2745
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,060
going to be grips and spider mates but

2746
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,179
they're also ones that there's good

2747
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:16,860
tools for they're fairly easy to control

2748
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:20,039
um might be a little bit different when

2749
01:42:16,859 --> 01:42:21,779
you get into down in this more Southern

2750
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:23,039
parts of the US so one of the things you

2751
01:42:21,779 --> 01:42:24,658
get is like for instance if we look at

2752
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:26,519
thrips that's for sure like one of the

2753
01:42:24,658 --> 01:42:28,439
big issues

2754
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,820
um but we've got a lot of good tools

2755
01:42:28,439 --> 01:42:32,460
like all the bio controls work really

2756
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:35,158
well on trips but 99 of all the trips we

2757
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:37,020
deal with in Canada and Northern us is

2758
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:39,118
Western Flower thrifts or onion trips

2759
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:40,560
and we know bio control works really

2760
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:42,118
well on that but there's thousands of

2761
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,400
different types of trips so when you get

2762
01:42:42,118 --> 01:42:46,198
down into like you know Southern Florida

2763
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:47,339
probably Southern California any of

2764
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:49,138
those Southern areas there's a lot of

2765
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:50,819
different types of thrips the biocontrol

2766
01:42:49,139 --> 01:42:52,618
doesn't work for so if that could emerge

2767
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:54,779
as an issue or there's just not any

2768
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:57,420
great tools like not the traditional

2769
01:42:54,779 --> 01:43:00,420
tools don't work that's to be seen right

2770
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:02,819
now I would say the bigger issue is most

2771
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:05,520
likely aphids

2772
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:07,979
um because and maybe hempressive maybe

2773
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:10,139
aggressively for two reasons or for one

2774
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:13,559
the same reason is there's not a lot of

2775
01:43:10,139 --> 01:43:15,000
great solutions for it so aphids control

2776
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:17,460
is

2777
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,880
really challenging there are some great

2778
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:23,219
solutions for it but the thing with

2779
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,980
aphids is they live birth so when it

2780
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:28,020
when you get one aphid in your garden

2781
01:43:25,979 --> 01:43:30,479
um they're already like they don't need

2782
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:33,480
to sexually reproduce so they've already

2783
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:36,419
got all their babies inside them ready

2784
01:43:33,479 --> 01:43:37,559
to go and I believe some entomology is

2785
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:39,179
probably correct me I'm pretty sure

2786
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,679
those babies are literally like the

2787
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:43,020
second they come out they've already got

2788
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:46,020
babies ready to go so they reproduce

2789
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:47,580
at a scary rate like I've seen multiple

2790
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:49,619
times where someone's literally got like

2791
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:51,719
one cannabis they fit in their garden

2792
01:43:49,618 --> 01:43:53,339
and you come back three weeks later and

2793
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:56,399
like the whole garden is ready to come

2794
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:58,199
down so we have predators that work

2795
01:43:56,399 --> 01:44:01,799
really really well on them

2796
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:03,539
it's really hard to get rid of all of

2797
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,340
the aphids though so like the thing when

2798
01:44:03,539 --> 01:44:07,500
something's like I do literally have to

2799
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:10,319
get when it reproduces that fast you

2800
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:12,000
need to get rid of every single aphid to

2801
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:13,618
control the problem and that doesn't

2802
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,198
really happen very often either with

2803
01:44:13,618 --> 01:44:18,238
spraying or

2804
01:44:16,198 --> 01:44:20,178
um bio control it does happen if you've

2805
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:22,259
got like a real you know heavy synthetic

2806
01:44:20,179 --> 01:44:23,579
systemic spray you can get rid of it's

2807
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:25,139
one treatment but I don't think that's

2808
01:44:23,579 --> 01:44:26,698
likely to be an option

2809
01:44:25,139 --> 01:44:28,380
but I think that's going to be a real

2810
01:44:26,698 --> 01:44:30,839
challenge just because

2811
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:33,000
bio control

2812
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,319
for aphids as all we kind of know what

2813
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,238
all the tools are when it comes to bio

2814
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:38,460
controls and we know they it's it's

2815
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:41,819
challenging to get rid of aphids 100

2816
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:44,158
it's pretty easy to control them 80 but

2817
01:44:41,819 --> 01:44:45,899
you don't necessarily especially with

2818
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:48,000
cannabis even it is really for anyone

2819
01:44:45,899 --> 01:44:51,238
that doesn't have them don't get them

2820
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,158
they are absolute nightmares

2821
01:44:51,238 --> 01:44:54,718
um it's basically it's essentially

2822
01:44:53,158 --> 01:44:56,579
impossible to get rid of them once you

2823
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:58,920
get them so just don't get them everyone

2824
01:44:56,579 --> 01:45:01,920
brings them in on clones like it's very

2825
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:05,100
preventable it's preventable pest

2826
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:07,500
but it's not a particularly controllable

2827
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:09,539
Pest and then rust it might or whatever

2828
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:12,000
any of those parsonoman mice they

2829
01:45:09,539 --> 01:45:14,519
haven't really emerged too much as a

2830
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,139
pest so far in Canada I know that it was

2831
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:17,219
more of an issue down in California and

2832
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:19,980
Colorado

2833
01:45:17,219 --> 01:45:21,480
but it does have the potential

2834
01:45:19,979 --> 01:45:24,238
just because

2835
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:26,099
um they kind of have a niche where

2836
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:27,718
Predator might generally are pretty good

2837
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:30,000
at controlling stuff like Russ at night

2838
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:32,880
but again they're hard to control them

2839
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,560
100 so a rough it might or broaden my

2840
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,118
they're really tight so they're a lot

2841
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,800
smaller than a

2842
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:40,319
um Predator might so that's kind of

2843
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:42,480
their evolutionary Niche is they can get

2844
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:44,939
into spots where the where their

2845
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:46,859
predators can't get so for instance if

2846
01:45:44,939 --> 01:45:49,500
you've got a plant in flowering it can

2847
01:45:46,859 --> 01:45:51,359
go way deep into a trichome stand where

2848
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:53,579
a Swarovski even though it can eat it or

2849
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:55,738
californicus can eat it it can't get in

2850
01:45:53,579 --> 01:45:57,899
that in that uh

2851
01:45:55,738 --> 01:46:00,479
stand and you get same thing you can go

2852
01:45:57,899 --> 01:46:01,920
again growing tips and stuff so

2853
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:03,599
generally what we've seen again I'm

2854
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:07,260
looking not just at canvas with other

2855
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:10,320
crops usually when people use bio

2856
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:13,199
control as a main standard

2857
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:14,639
those paths like rusted might or

2858
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:16,618
Broadway aren't much of an issue because

2859
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:18,060
preventatively they do a really good job

2860
01:46:16,618 --> 01:46:19,859
of stopping them from Ever Getting

2861
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:22,139
established and it's kind of why I think

2862
01:46:19,859 --> 01:46:24,960
maybe you saw that emergence in the

2863
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:26,420
early days out of California and

2864
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,920
um Colorado

2865
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:31,319
nobody was really using predators that

2866
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:33,118
much back then so and you don't hear

2867
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:34,920
about it as much and we've definitely

2868
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:37,679
had a couple of outbreaks in Canada at

2869
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,359
LPS but it's been very very low but I

2870
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,880
could be like the potential and they're

2871
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:43,500
ones that's very easily spread through

2872
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:44,639
cutting material and that's the one

2873
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:47,158
thing I've seen in the legalized

2874
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:49,500
industry is there's really a just an

2875
01:46:47,158 --> 01:46:51,899
unprecedented amount of spreading of

2876
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:54,420
clones between facilities and that's

2877
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:55,920
something that could easily get going

2878
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,658
but if I have to pick one it would be

2879
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,279
100

2880
01:46:56,658 --> 01:47:02,158
cannabis aphid second would probably be

2881
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:05,039
root aphid yeah I mean there's certainly

2882
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:07,079
two pests I've seen cause havoc in a

2883
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,939
variety of different grow environments

2884
01:47:07,079 --> 01:47:11,579
something I was hoping to get your

2885
01:47:08,939 --> 01:47:13,198
opinion on is I'd noticed I'd been to a

2886
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:15,179
few bigger facilities when I'd been over

2887
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:17,698
in the states and it sort of seemed to

2888
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:19,980
me like when a facility got to a certain

2889
01:47:17,698 --> 01:47:23,219
size it just sort of reached this

2890
01:47:19,979 --> 01:47:25,379
critical mass and pest infestation was

2891
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:27,840
almost inevitable from what I had seen

2892
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:29,579
and admittedly limited number of sites

2893
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,800
I'd been to you've probably been to many

2894
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:33,539
more larger facilities than I have would

2895
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:35,520
you agree that you've seen that sort of

2896
01:47:33,539 --> 01:47:37,738
thing happen regularly or is my

2897
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:40,199
experiences maybe a little skewed and

2898
01:47:37,738 --> 01:47:42,479
that's not what normally happens

2899
01:47:40,198 --> 01:47:44,638
no it's definitely true we've also seen

2900
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:47,158
it on other crops it is a general rule

2901
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:50,819
as as the facility gets bigger the fast

2902
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:53,219
issues get bigger also

2903
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:56,039
um I think it's for a bunch of reasons I

2904
01:47:53,219 --> 01:47:57,359
think more of it though is like I've

2905
01:47:56,039 --> 01:47:59,460
definitely seen because I've kind of

2906
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:02,460
seen this evolving you get

2907
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:04,020
um you know even you'll get guys that

2908
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:05,520
when they've got small scenes you're

2909
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:06,780
kind of on top of like for instance

2910
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,000
bricks is one of the things like I've

2911
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:10,618
seen and same with spider Mike I've seen

2912
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,238
guys that have literally they've been

2913
01:48:10,618 --> 01:48:14,039
growing for like 10 years on you know

2914
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:15,118
they maybe got a 40 lighter they've

2915
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:16,380
never had

2916
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,658
thrips

2917
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:20,520
and all of a sudden they get them and

2918
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:23,059
they can never get rid of them how are

2919
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,440
the thrifts under control they're like

2920
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:27,360
yes like they're using bio control it

2921
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:30,299
controls them but I think it's like one

2922
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:32,039
of those things like once you get thrips

2923
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:33,060
in your crop that's like that's just one

2924
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:35,100
of the big things that I think people

2925
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:38,159
don't understand properly when it comes

2926
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:40,860
to path is the difference between like

2927
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:43,439
a thrifts or any past and a thrips

2928
01:48:40,859 --> 01:48:46,380
that's adapted to the crop that you're

2929
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:47,519
in so when you get a thrips that you

2930
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:49,980
know let's say you get a thrift

2931
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,639
infestation by default you know you've

2932
01:48:49,979 --> 01:48:52,799
got

2933
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:53,940
a kazillion thrips in there some of them

2934
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,100
really like

2935
01:48:53,939 --> 01:48:57,658
cannabis right and those tend to be the

2936
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,860
ones that reproduce so then you get in

2937
01:48:57,658 --> 01:49:00,920
really

2938
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:00,920
um

2939
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:05,940
adapted to your environment and they're

2940
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,039
really hard to get rid of because like

2941
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:11,819
again all you need is you know one or

2942
01:49:08,039 --> 01:49:13,139
two thrips I guess two thrips and so you

2943
01:49:11,819 --> 01:49:14,340
you know maybe you don't have them for

2944
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:15,600
it looks like you don't have trips for

2945
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:17,400
two months and then they come back well

2946
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,440
it's just because you didn't it's almost

2947
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:21,059
impossible to get rid of every single

2948
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:23,339
strips out of your versatility so I

2949
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:25,260
think when those guys were smaller it

2950
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,699
wasn't they could go a long time without

2951
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:28,139
Ever Getting strips but now they're

2952
01:49:26,698 --> 01:49:30,419
bigger eventually it comes in from

2953
01:49:28,139 --> 01:49:32,819
somewhere and once you get them you've

2954
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:34,859
gotten for good like trips just if you

2955
01:49:32,819 --> 01:49:36,539
look at any other crops which is just

2956
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:37,679
like a standard like anyone thinks

2957
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:39,238
they're never gonna have thrips is

2958
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,618
dreaming like they're just they're

2959
01:49:39,238 --> 01:49:42,479
everywhere right they're outside in the

2960
01:49:40,618 --> 01:49:45,118
grass they're coming in on your workers

2961
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:46,859
they're coming in on pegs in your plant

2962
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:49,198
material like there's too many avenues

2963
01:49:46,859 --> 01:49:50,880
for them to come here so

2964
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:52,618
um

2965
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,460
yeah I think that would be my answer for

2966
01:49:52,618 --> 01:49:56,639
that one

2967
01:49:53,460 --> 01:50:00,000
yeah okay I mean you've got me sort of

2968
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:03,480
thinking now what might be some of the

2969
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,238
sort of specific challenges the cannabis

2970
01:50:03,479 --> 01:50:08,279
plant presents in a bio control program

2971
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:10,198
or like for example even just the

2972
01:50:08,279 --> 01:50:13,679
environment you know are there any sort

2973
01:50:10,198 --> 01:50:16,259
of room conditions which might make bio

2974
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:18,300
control more challenging or more easy in

2975
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:20,219
fact

2976
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:21,719
yeah the biggest I mean the biggest room

2977
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:24,420
condition it generally hasn't been much

2978
01:50:21,719 --> 01:50:25,980
of an issue the one thing I've had now

2979
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:27,539
that people have kind of dialed in their

2980
01:50:25,979 --> 01:50:30,059
systems that don't see it as much but

2981
01:50:27,539 --> 01:50:32,100
back when those first facilities started

2982
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:33,980
getting built you know large scale I saw

2983
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:36,539
a bunch of times where people had um

2984
01:50:33,979 --> 01:50:38,459
their horizontal airflow fans just

2985
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:40,979
mounted too low and there seemed to be a

2986
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:42,420
pressure all right some guys that really

2987
01:50:40,979 --> 01:50:43,439
liked it you'd probably see them like

2988
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,179
you go under their crop and you're like

2989
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:46,559
man it's like a tropical storm in here

2990
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:49,800
you know the plants are bending over

2991
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:52,260
they've just got so much fans going on

2992
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,940
them and that's the only thing that I've

2993
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:56,400
really seen in cannabis production

2994
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:58,678
that's caused a big issue so for

2995
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:00,238
instance we had a facility that had a

2996
01:50:58,679 --> 01:51:02,639
big they had a thrifts problem but the

2997
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:04,799
thrift's problem was only around the

2998
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:07,618
perimeter of the room and what it was

2999
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:10,440
was in the perimeter of the room those

3000
01:51:07,618 --> 01:51:12,359
fans were creating like a micro climate

3001
01:51:10,439 --> 01:51:14,219
they were just basically drying out the

3002
01:51:12,359 --> 01:51:15,658
leaf so much that the Predator might

3003
01:51:14,219 --> 01:51:17,279
just could just couldn't live on there

3004
01:51:15,658 --> 01:51:19,198
so the predator mites were working fine

3005
01:51:17,279 --> 01:51:21,118
in the middle of the room but when it

3006
01:51:19,198 --> 01:51:22,559
got close to the fans they the thrips

3007
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:25,259
were taking over because the thrips were

3008
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:27,900
able to uh you know tolerate that high

3009
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:30,000
wind so that's really been the main

3010
01:51:27,899 --> 01:51:31,738
thing that I think we've seen and it's

3011
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,179
not that common it's kind of now that

3012
01:51:31,738 --> 01:51:34,738
people's relation plants don't really

3013
01:51:33,179 --> 01:51:37,079
like to be grown in a tropical storm

3014
01:51:34,738 --> 01:51:39,599
condition people have moved away from

3015
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:41,399
that the plant itself definitely

3016
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:43,860
presents some challenges and one of the

3017
01:51:41,399 --> 01:51:47,460
biggest so there's two the two main

3018
01:51:43,859 --> 01:51:50,039
challenges is one that a lot of

3019
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:52,800
uh predator mites don't reproduce on it

3020
01:51:50,039 --> 01:51:54,079
the way they reproduce on other crops

3021
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,340
um

3022
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:58,198
so like I said if I kind of got into

3023
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:00,060
this before where they really need that

3024
01:51:58,198 --> 01:52:02,819
specialized plant hair to lay their eggs

3025
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:04,199
on and I think you get some like I

3026
01:52:02,819 --> 01:52:06,179
definitely seen some reproduction but if

3027
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:07,738
I compare it to like a pepper crop or a

3028
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:09,600
cucumber crab it's nothing compared to

3029
01:52:07,738 --> 01:52:11,099
those crops like they really those are

3030
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,719
ones you could literally put in a little

3031
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:14,760
bit of loose stuff in one corner and you

3032
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:16,260
come back you know two months later and

3033
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:17,880
there's predator mites like over your

3034
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:20,280
whole crop with cannabis you really need

3035
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,139
to put the constant Supply in there to

3036
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:23,579
keep the numbers up high enough so

3037
01:52:22,139 --> 01:52:25,260
that's one thing that people they try

3038
01:52:23,579 --> 01:52:27,300
and extrapolate what's gone on in other

3039
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:29,219
crops and you can't really do it from

3040
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:30,360
Peppers to cannabis it's different crops

3041
01:52:29,219 --> 01:52:31,139
so you really want to make sure you've

3042
01:52:30,359 --> 01:52:34,079
got

3043
01:52:31,139 --> 01:52:36,179
again not drink during Peak flour but

3044
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:37,738
you want to have a continuous source of

3045
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:39,899
Predator mice which usually means

3046
01:52:37,738 --> 01:52:42,019
sachets

3047
01:52:39,899 --> 01:52:44,759
um and then the other thing that people

3048
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:46,980
you really need to front load it so like

3049
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:48,539
for instance like a pepper crop or a lot

3050
01:52:46,979 --> 01:52:50,638
of other crops

3051
01:52:48,539 --> 01:52:52,260
um you've got like a Long window to

3052
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:54,119
control your pest in like a pepper crab

3053
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:54,659
that's like a year in a greenhouse

3054
01:52:54,119 --> 01:52:55,260
[Music]

3055
01:52:54,658 --> 01:52:56,939
um

3056
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:58,139
with cannabis I mean I don't know what

3057
01:52:56,939 --> 01:52:59,759
the average should to look at I mean

3058
01:52:58,139 --> 01:53:01,380
probably average guys vegging for like

3059
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,300
two weeks and then they've got another

3060
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:05,100
two or three weeks in flowering before

3061
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:07,619
the buds are too stacked up to control

3062
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:10,800
them properly so you've got at best a

3063
01:53:07,618 --> 01:53:12,839
four or five week window to work with so

3064
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,639
you can't use conventional rates so for

3065
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:16,380
instance on a vegetable crop you might

3066
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:18,900
put 10 per meter per stimulus again

3067
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:21,300
because it's got you know months to

3068
01:53:18,899 --> 01:53:23,099
control of spider mates in cannabis

3069
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:24,420
you've maybe got four or five weeks so I

3070
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:26,520
mean instead of ten you're putting in

3071
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:27,600
like 100 or something like that so

3072
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:30,719
that's something you really need to

3073
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:33,360
compensate you really need to

3074
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,679
go hard like front load everything you

3075
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:36,179
want to be treating your it really

3076
01:53:34,679 --> 01:53:38,399
starts at your mom's you want to make

3077
01:53:36,179 --> 01:53:41,100
sure you really want to just start from

3078
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:43,920
the from the start of the whole thing

3079
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:45,900
and then you're ramping off as you get

3080
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:47,520
into flowering not what a lot of people

3081
01:53:45,899 --> 01:53:49,618
do is go holy cow I got a big problem

3082
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:51,540
and then they start ramping up as you go

3083
01:53:49,618 --> 01:53:53,279
into bio into flowering you really want

3084
01:53:51,539 --> 01:53:55,800
a strong preventative approach and to be

3085
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:57,658
on those things before your buds stack

3086
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:59,699
up once you're in like you know

3087
01:53:57,658 --> 01:54:00,960
depending on the strain once first I

3088
01:53:59,698 --> 01:54:03,118
find most strains it's like the first

3089
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:05,520
third of flowering is the stretch period

3090
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:07,500
like the veg period so you really want

3091
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,960
to have all your pests controlled done

3092
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:12,600
within that first one third

3093
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:14,100
yeah a brilliant sentiment hopefully

3094
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:16,320
people can start implementing that one

3095
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:19,440
so they don't find themselves in the uh

3096
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:21,599
the dreaded week four week five surprise

3097
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:23,279
of finding the the russet mites are

3098
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:26,460
actually everywhere sort of got me

3099
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:29,460
thinking about the future of IPM

3100
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:31,139
strategies and Pest Management and

3101
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:34,500
something I was hoping you might have

3102
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:37,020
some insight into is anecdotally said

3103
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:39,420
that various strains have different

3104
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:41,940
susceptibility to pests yet sort of long

3105
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:44,219
anecdotally been said that plants with

3106
01:54:41,939 --> 01:54:46,259
the strong blueberry lineage are like

3107
01:54:44,219 --> 01:54:48,600
almost like magnets for tests at least

3108
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:50,100
that's been some of my experience do you

3109
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,260
think these sort of anecdotes are true

3110
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:54,900
that like certain phenotypes or certain

3111
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:57,900
strains are just inherently far more

3112
01:54:54,899 --> 01:55:00,420
susceptible to pest infestation and as a

3113
01:54:57,899 --> 01:55:02,399
follow-up do you think that breeding for

3114
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:05,460
pest resistance might become a more

3115
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:06,960
focal part of Pest management in general

3116
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:09,300
in the future

3117
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:12,060
yeah it's 100 True like there's no doubt

3118
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:12,960
about that we've seen it so many times

3119
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:15,420
um

3120
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,980
with I've seen it in LPS I've seen it

3121
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:20,100
like it's a standing joke in the

3122
01:55:16,979 --> 01:55:22,439
Canadian cannabis Community there was

3123
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:25,619
this clone going around called uh people

3124
01:55:22,439 --> 01:55:29,219
call it the perps or Vancouver Island uh

3125
01:55:25,618 --> 01:55:31,019
purple indica and it is the every person

3126
01:55:29,219 --> 01:55:33,179
I've known has had this thing it is the

3127
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:34,440
most pest prone thing you've ever got

3128
01:55:33,179 --> 01:55:36,600
like if you've got an aphid in the

3129
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:38,339
garden it's on this clone it just and

3130
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:40,739
partly I think it's really old clone so

3131
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:42,119
when plants get older they become more

3132
01:55:40,738 --> 01:55:45,718
attractive to pests but it's definitely

3133
01:55:42,118 --> 01:55:47,639
like this clone is I've passed magnet we

3134
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:50,939
actually do at Cooper we are actually

3135
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:52,739
doing research on on uh on cannabis

3136
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:54,899
Aphid control we specifically actually

3137
01:55:52,738 --> 01:55:57,238
used that clone because we knew the

3138
01:55:54,899 --> 01:55:58,979
camera see if it just loved it and I've

3139
01:55:57,238 --> 01:56:01,079
seen it a lot I don't think anyone can

3140
01:55:58,979 --> 01:56:03,359
like think we're like definitely was

3141
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:05,158
seen for instance sativa like really

3142
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:08,339
sativa ones

3143
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:10,799
um they tend to get thrips really early

3144
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:13,020
but again it comes down to the terpenes

3145
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,300
and I think there's it's so it's so very

3146
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:17,400
able I've definitely seen a lot of hazes

3147
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:19,079
really get drips

3148
01:56:17,399 --> 01:56:19,738
um bad

3149
01:56:19,079 --> 01:56:23,279
um

3150
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:25,439
I'd say terpene is one of the bigger

3151
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:28,259
issues and where I think people

3152
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:30,000
overthink it so is this can breeding be

3153
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:31,380
done probably I personally think it's

3154
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,880
more of a disease thing than the past

3155
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:34,380
thing I think stuff like that purple

3156
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:35,639
Indigo clone will just naturally get

3157
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:38,699
called out of the population because

3158
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:40,800
zubac wants to deal with with that

3159
01:56:38,698 --> 01:56:43,379
um I think disease resistance is very

3160
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:45,000
much and uh something that needs to be

3161
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:46,560
done and will be done in breeding

3162
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,359
specifically for powdery mildew and

3163
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:51,179
botrytus

3164
01:56:48,359 --> 01:56:52,979
um past one I'm not I'm not sure I do

3165
01:56:51,179 --> 01:56:55,020
I've definitely seen some people steer

3166
01:56:52,979 --> 01:56:56,519
themselves wrong where they're like no

3167
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:58,500
no I'm not going to grow any Haze

3168
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:01,199
because I know I heard that Haze gets

3169
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:02,639
whatever thrips or something else and I

3170
01:57:01,198 --> 01:57:05,698
mean you know you know yourself like

3171
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:07,739
it's not so it's not like any of the

3172
01:57:05,698 --> 01:57:08,839
strains there are so

3173
01:57:07,738 --> 01:57:11,459
um

3174
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:12,960
stable like every different phenotype is

3175
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:14,219
slightly different so I think you got

3176
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,380
people that are like I'm not growing OG

3177
01:57:14,219 --> 01:57:18,179
Kush because it's this and I was like

3178
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:19,319
well why don't you if you grow a pack

3179
01:57:18,179 --> 01:57:21,060
you're probably gonna get one that

3180
01:57:19,319 --> 01:57:23,279
really gets thrips and another one that

3181
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:25,440
strips won't even go close to it so

3182
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:27,599
it's not so black and white and I've

3183
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:29,039
definitely seen some LPS getting into

3184
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,539
that where they're like I'm not growing

3185
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:32,819
that because it's this strain and

3186
01:57:30,539 --> 01:57:33,899
they're like dude like all hazes aren't

3187
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:36,118
the same

3188
01:57:33,899 --> 01:57:38,219
um it's not you can't make those blanket

3189
01:57:36,118 --> 01:57:41,939
statements but definitely from clone to

3190
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:44,579
clone that is not a urban legend that is

3191
01:57:41,939 --> 01:57:47,279
for sure real that some stuff is far

3192
01:57:44,579 --> 01:57:48,479
more susceptible to different tests than

3193
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:51,179
others

3194
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:53,098
yeah okay that's really interesting to

3195
01:57:51,179 --> 01:57:55,139
hear and good to know it's uh it's not

3196
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:57,539
all in my head another question I was

3197
01:57:55,139 --> 01:58:00,300
interested in is that I've noticed there

3198
01:57:57,539 --> 01:58:02,939
can be sort of a variability in activity

3199
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:05,279
levels of some of the mites I've gotten

3200
01:58:02,939 --> 01:58:07,799
are there any recommendations you have

3201
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:09,359
that can help ensure once I do have the

3202
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:10,860
predator and I'm releasing it in the

3203
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:12,598
garden that I'm sort of getting the most

3204
01:58:10,859 --> 01:58:14,880
out of them you know are there any sort

3205
01:58:12,599 --> 01:58:17,400
of factors which I may unawaringly

3206
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:20,940
hindering them or you know accidentally

3207
01:58:17,399 --> 01:58:22,979
killing them off after releasing them

3208
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:24,839
um not too much usually if there's an

3209
01:58:22,979 --> 01:58:27,059
issue with like the only two real issues

3210
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:28,980
is that spraying is one

3211
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:31,020
um excess airflow is another of just

3212
01:58:28,979 --> 01:58:32,638
like like Direct on the plant but the

3213
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:34,679
one thing I would I would caveat that

3214
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,239
statement with is that it definitely

3215
01:58:34,679 --> 01:58:37,500
like Predator might like there's a lot

3216
01:58:36,238 --> 01:58:39,178
to them so you there's definitely

3217
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:40,800
suppliers on the market that probably

3218
01:58:39,179 --> 01:58:41,880
sell some pretty crappy Predator

3219
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,739
termites

3220
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,000
um but what I would caveat is I would

3221
01:58:43,738 --> 01:58:47,399
say

3222
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,579
um like I run you know part of my job is

3223
01:58:47,399 --> 01:58:52,559
I kind of oversee a lot of the the sales

3224
01:58:50,579 --> 01:58:53,880
complaints and stuff that come in and I

3225
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,179
would say the vast majority of

3226
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:58,679
complaints that we get

3227
01:58:57,179 --> 01:59:00,539
um for especially for predator right

3228
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:01,920
they're just perceived complaints

3229
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:04,859
they're not there's not actually nothing

3230
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:06,658
wrong with the product so like they're

3231
01:59:04,859 --> 01:59:08,098
hard to see like especially if you don't

3232
01:59:06,658 --> 01:59:09,238
know what your look like if you're not

3233
01:59:08,099 --> 01:59:10,980
really trained for what you're looking

3234
01:59:09,238 --> 01:59:12,779
for and a lot of people they're looking

3235
01:59:10,979 --> 01:59:14,638
at it with a bare eye well I've been

3236
01:59:12,779 --> 01:59:17,579
doing this for like half my life and I

3237
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:19,079
can't tell you without a microscope so

3238
01:59:17,579 --> 01:59:21,059
there's a couple of things to keep in

3239
01:59:19,079 --> 01:59:22,738
mind so one Predator makes because

3240
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:25,080
they're so tiny like they're really hard

3241
01:59:22,738 --> 01:59:27,718
to count so what you can definitely get

3242
01:59:25,079 --> 01:59:30,238
is a real thing like let's say you buy a

3243
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:33,000
bottle of persimulus let's say it's

3244
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:36,479
supposed to be 10 000 in it most of the

3245
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,859
time there's more like 15 or 17 000 in

3246
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:39,238
there because they over pack everything

3247
01:59:37,859 --> 01:59:40,439
and I'm sure we're not the only company

3248
01:59:39,238 --> 01:59:42,779
that does that because you need to

3249
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:44,279
guarantee there's ten thousand you can't

3250
01:59:42,779 --> 01:59:46,139
have somebody sitting there it's very

3251
01:59:44,279 --> 01:59:48,719
difficult to calculate exactly how much

3252
01:59:46,139 --> 01:59:51,118
is in there so people overshoot it so

3253
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,198
let's say we're and don't hold any of

3254
01:59:51,118 --> 01:59:55,019
these numbers but it's definitely like

3255
01:59:52,198 --> 01:59:56,939
this like it's okay you're way over the

3256
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:59,280
spec and then

3257
01:59:56,939 --> 02:00:01,618
maybe there's uh like first of all those

3258
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:04,439
populations fluctuate a little bit so

3259
02:00:01,618 --> 02:00:06,118
the same amount of material one week

3260
02:00:04,439 --> 02:00:08,339
might have

3261
02:00:06,118 --> 02:00:11,219
whatever ten thousand mites the next

3262
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:12,840
week might have 17 000 mice so it

3263
02:00:11,219 --> 02:00:15,179
fluctuates and you've got people but

3264
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:16,500
people don't get so we're guaranteeing a

3265
02:00:15,179 --> 02:00:18,658
minimum and quite often they're getting

3266
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:20,460
way more than that and then what happens

3267
02:00:18,658 --> 02:00:21,658
is yeah there's some weeks that you're

3268
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:24,239
actually getting what we say you're

3269
02:00:21,658 --> 02:00:25,979
getting and but you get used to seeing

3270
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:26,879
something and it's it's not accurate you

3271
02:00:25,979 --> 02:00:28,138
know what I mean you're getting used to

3272
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,980
seeing way more than you were actually

3273
02:00:28,139 --> 02:00:35,460
paying for that's definitely a big

3274
02:00:31,979 --> 02:00:36,959
a a big issue and the thing also with

3275
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:39,960
pressure which people don't guess like

3276
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:42,359
there's a there's not like there's some

3277
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:44,099
bios that are difficult to ship predator

3278
02:00:42,359 --> 02:00:45,299
mites are one of the easiest things to

3279
02:00:44,099 --> 02:00:46,800
ship because they've got to because

3280
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:48,539
you're not shipping them dormant like

3281
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,860
there's a food source in there so

3282
02:00:48,539 --> 02:00:51,479
they're just alive and at room

3283
02:00:49,859 --> 02:00:53,759
temperature most of the time so there's

3284
02:00:51,479 --> 02:00:55,439
not really a whole lot to go wrong in

3285
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:57,900
transport so does it happen sure

3286
02:00:55,439 --> 02:00:59,879
sometimes absolutely but it's a very

3287
02:00:57,899 --> 02:01:02,339
small percentage of the time

3288
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:04,440
that that's great that answers what I

3289
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:06,779
was wondering almost perfectly

3290
02:01:04,439 --> 02:01:08,939
so up next we actually had a question

3291
02:01:06,779 --> 02:01:11,939
submitted from one of our patreon

3292
02:01:08,939 --> 02:01:13,678
listeners and they basically said look

3293
02:01:11,939 --> 02:01:14,759
you know I love that I'm just going to

3294
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:16,920
read a word for it because I love the

3295
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:18,780
way they've worded it they say thrips

3296
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,000
are the devil they naturally occur

3297
02:01:18,779 --> 02:01:22,738
outdoors in my area and it's impossible

3298
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,840
to grow a plant without getting them

3299
02:01:22,738 --> 02:01:27,000
I've knocked them down before but they

3300
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:28,319
always come back if the plant stays

3301
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,238
healthy and they don't take them over

3302
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:33,420
it's just a constant fight without

3303
02:01:30,238 --> 02:01:35,279
pesticides beneficials help but they

3304
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:38,699
don't seem to ever reproduce enough to

3305
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:40,738
keep up have you got any suggestions

3306
02:01:38,698 --> 02:01:43,439
yeah so I think and you do get some air

3307
02:01:40,738 --> 02:01:46,198
like the out the outdoor kind of ambient

3308
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:48,238
level of thrips can vary a lot between

3309
02:01:46,198 --> 02:01:50,819
different places like I always remember

3310
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:52,618
I had a greenhouse

3311
02:01:50,819 --> 02:01:54,420
um like I said I grew where I live is

3312
02:01:52,618 --> 02:01:56,339
like there's literally 3 000 Acres of

3313
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:59,099
greenhouses within 20 minutes I've seen

3314
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:01,619
like a lot of past pressures like I've

3315
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:03,659
seen a lot of crops but I also do all

3316
02:02:01,618 --> 02:02:05,460
over I work all over Canada and I

3317
02:02:03,658 --> 02:02:08,460
remember being out in the Prairies once

3318
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:10,679
and which is a drier grassy kind of

3319
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:13,560
habitat and we could never control

3320
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:16,319
strips of this one facility and

3321
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:17,699
I remember trying to put my finger on

3322
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:19,139
like what was going on and I was like

3323
02:02:17,698 --> 02:02:21,839
you know what I'm just gonna hang some

3324
02:02:19,139 --> 02:02:24,179
sticky cards outside to see like what

3325
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:26,159
the outside pressure of scripts was and

3326
02:02:24,179 --> 02:02:27,599
this was like a 10 acre greenhouse or

3327
02:02:26,158 --> 02:02:29,279
something and I hung a yellow sticky

3328
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:31,199
card outside one end of the greenhouse

3329
02:02:29,279 --> 02:02:32,880
and then I drove to the end which maybe

3330
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:35,638
took you know two minutes or something

3331
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:37,920
like that and hung hung another one and

3332
02:02:35,639 --> 02:02:39,359
just on a fluke on the way back I was

3333
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:41,099
like I'll just check that first card and

3334
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:43,559
see if it caught anything yet and that

3335
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:45,360
first card had like you know 10 000

3336
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:48,060
trips on it or something where where I

3337
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:49,618
live it would have like one if that

3338
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:51,239
um so it's really can be different so

3339
02:02:49,618 --> 02:02:53,158
you definitely can get some areas where

3340
02:02:51,238 --> 02:02:54,419
you're just getting a crazy amount of

3341
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:56,399
strips coming inside so I don't know

3342
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:58,020
whether he's Outdoors or or in a

3343
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:00,000
greenhouse or indoors indoors there's

3344
02:02:58,020 --> 02:03:02,040
definitely a lot of buffer between you

3345
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,219
so I'd say if you're getting a big

3346
02:03:02,039 --> 02:03:07,380
problem in a small indoor place you're

3347
02:03:05,219 --> 02:03:09,420
probably making the problem yourself

3348
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:11,300
even though you don't want to admit it

3349
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:13,380
um so

3350
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:15,840
basically where I think most people go

3351
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:17,099
wrong it when serps control is they or

3352
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,139
not most people but when there's a

3353
02:03:17,099 --> 02:03:21,300
problem it's generally to the to do with

3354
02:03:19,139 --> 02:03:23,460
this issue is

3355
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:24,539
predator mites they're only they are

3356
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:27,539
your best

3357
02:03:24,539 --> 02:03:29,039
your kind of Baseline attack but

3358
02:03:27,539 --> 02:03:30,840
Predator might doesn't matter what kind

3359
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:34,139
they're only used they're only eating

3360
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:36,480
the first n star of thrift so that's

3361
02:03:34,139 --> 02:03:38,159
frips will lay its egg on the planet and

3362
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:39,839
then that egg hatches out into the first

3363
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:41,939
larval stage which is kind of like a

3364
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:44,219
little worm that that has no wings they

3365
02:03:41,939 --> 02:03:46,618
can just crawl around in feeds so thrips

3366
02:03:44,219 --> 02:03:48,599
or a Swarovski or cucamaras they only

3367
02:03:46,618 --> 02:03:50,939
eat that one stage

3368
02:03:48,599 --> 02:03:53,400
so once it gets past that stage if

3369
02:03:50,939 --> 02:03:54,960
you're just using predator mites there's

3370
02:03:53,399 --> 02:03:56,638
all these strips in your crop that

3371
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:58,679
you're not controlling at all and then

3372
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,719
an adult thrips in some in some

3373
02:03:58,679 --> 02:04:03,420
temperatures it'll last like a month two

3374
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:04,800
months even longer so that can be like

3375
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:06,118
your whole crop where you've got this

3376
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,860
big strips problem and you're putting in

3377
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:09,598
swersky thinking you did something but

3378
02:04:07,859 --> 02:04:10,859
you've got all these adult herbs flying

3379
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:13,319
around

3380
02:04:10,859 --> 02:04:16,559
you know causing chaos that nothing is

3381
02:04:13,319 --> 02:04:18,000
controlling so you really have to go a

3382
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:19,860
multi same with any pass you need to go

3383
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,479
with a multi-pronged approach so for

3384
02:04:19,859 --> 02:04:23,759
there you're going to put your Predator

3385
02:04:21,479 --> 02:04:25,799
mic as your kind of base level control

3386
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,840
but then you need to put something else

3387
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:30,239
in to get those other stages out of the

3388
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:31,560
equation and the best especially on

3389
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:33,178
cannabis because it really likes the

3390
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:35,400
canvas point is the product or trading

3391
02:04:33,179 --> 02:04:37,380
is Thrift or but it's uh Aureus and

3392
02:04:35,399 --> 02:04:39,658
that's like a predatory bug so it can

3393
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:41,819
fly around and they're like thrips

3394
02:04:39,658 --> 02:04:45,299
Killers like they're generous but they

3395
02:04:41,819 --> 02:04:47,279
really like killing thrips and you put

3396
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:48,920
like they will literally turn get rid of

3397
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:51,479
all the thrips in like a week usually

3398
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:53,639
the problem with like and they go after

3399
02:04:51,479 --> 02:04:55,259
all the different stages the problem is

3400
02:04:53,639 --> 02:04:58,139
if you were to not put the Predator

3401
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:59,940
might and just put in the trip or or the

3402
02:04:58,139 --> 02:05:01,260
Aureus is they'll eat all your thrips

3403
02:04:59,939 --> 02:05:02,759
and then they die off because there's no

3404
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:04,560
food and then there's a whole bunch of

3405
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:05,760
trips eggs in the leaf which two weeks

3406
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:07,199
later hatch out and then there's no

3407
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,760
predator for them and bang you got a

3408
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:10,379
purpose problem again so that's why you

3409
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:13,380
always want that overlapping you know

3410
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:15,300
the predator mites are controlling any

3411
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:18,118
new stuff coming up and then the Fripp

3412
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:19,800
or is killing any of the larger stages

3413
02:05:18,118 --> 02:05:21,598
another when it doesn't work quite as

3414
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:23,360
well but it's a it's a viable strategy

3415
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:26,400
is to use a lot of sticky cards so

3416
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:28,380
sticky cards will uh attach the adult

3417
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:29,939
trips that are attracted to it so you

3418
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:31,440
can also use that combination where

3419
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:33,779
you're using the Predator mic to go

3420
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:35,759
after those young stages the sticky

3421
02:05:33,779 --> 02:05:37,979
cards to go after the to catch the

3422
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,139
adults so I most of the time when I see

3423
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:42,419
people have issues with drips it's

3424
02:05:40,139 --> 02:05:45,900
because they're ignoring those other

3425
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:49,800
life cycle stages

3426
02:05:45,899 --> 02:05:53,279
I guess it's sort of segues into

3427
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:55,860
the future of products you know a lot of

3428
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:58,500
uh recent and interesting new

3429
02:05:55,859 --> 02:06:01,079
technologies are emerging in the

3430
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:03,179
predator and IPM industry and one that

3431
02:06:01,079 --> 02:06:06,238
we've been talking about a little bit at

3432
02:06:03,179 --> 02:06:07,500
the start of our episodes is some of the

3433
02:06:06,238 --> 02:06:09,000
new technology you guys have been

3434
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:11,340
working on particularly the one that

3435
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:14,219
caught my eye was the spidex revital

3436
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:16,199
that proof of predation technology was

3437
02:06:14,219 --> 02:06:18,539
really interesting from my perspective

3438
02:06:16,198 --> 02:06:21,658
because it gives you that real-time

3439
02:06:18,539 --> 02:06:23,880
feedback on the activity levels of the

3440
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:25,920
mites with that um you know changing

3441
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:27,539
color sort of Technology do you think

3442
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:29,460
that that'll become a new industry

3443
02:06:27,539 --> 02:06:31,859
standard having these sort of built-in

3444
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:33,480
features around predators and do you

3445
02:06:31,859 --> 02:06:35,519
have any other cool things on the

3446
02:06:33,479 --> 02:06:37,759
horizon you might be able to let us know

3447
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,760
about

3448
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:42,179
um so I don't know that so that's an

3449
02:06:39,899 --> 02:06:43,939
interesting one because the the so what

3450
02:06:42,179 --> 02:06:46,380
happens is when you buy the Predator mic

3451
02:06:43,939 --> 02:06:48,658
it's translucent so you can see through

3452
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:50,940
it so and then when it eats spider mice

3453
02:06:48,658 --> 02:06:52,618
it turns bright red so that was kind of

3454
02:06:50,939 --> 02:06:54,598
a side effect of something else so that

3455
02:06:52,618 --> 02:06:56,698
spider mites was that one like if it was

3456
02:06:54,599 --> 02:06:58,679
the last remaining Predator mic that

3457
02:06:56,698 --> 02:07:00,598
nobody could figure out how to rear on

3458
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:03,719
something other than its natural prey

3459
02:07:00,599 --> 02:07:05,880
source so it's a it's a consequence of

3460
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:08,460
eating spider mites that makes it bread

3461
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:10,500
so in the old up until this year we used

3462
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:12,239
to rear them on Spider-Man so they'd be

3463
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:13,859
red when you bought them

3464
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:15,899
um now we've figured out how to rear

3465
02:07:13,859 --> 02:07:17,939
them on a different food source

3466
02:07:15,899 --> 02:07:19,319
um so they're actually not red and it's

3467
02:07:17,939 --> 02:07:21,779
a really cool thing because you put them

3468
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:23,158
into the crop and they're clear and they

3469
02:07:21,779 --> 02:07:24,539
instantly so there's no doubt about

3470
02:07:23,158 --> 02:07:26,399
whether they're working you're like well

3471
02:07:24,539 --> 02:07:27,539
are they red okay well then it's eating

3472
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:29,039
spider mites like it's that clear

3473
02:07:27,539 --> 02:07:31,079
because that's the only thing that can

3474
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:32,340
make them red but it wasn't there as an

3475
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:34,079
indicator it's just something that was

3476
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:34,739
kind of a cool thing that

3477
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:37,679
um

3478
02:07:34,738 --> 02:07:40,198
that you know was an added benefit

3479
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:42,300
um so that was kind of the last one for

3480
02:07:40,198 --> 02:07:44,819
like all the other predator mites were

3481
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:46,199
always like that so I don't know whether

3482
02:07:44,819 --> 02:07:49,319
that will

3483
02:07:46,198 --> 02:07:51,178
be uh where the future I actually don't

3484
02:07:49,319 --> 02:07:54,238
know where the future a lot of it will

3485
02:07:51,179 --> 02:07:57,118
probably some new Predator might is

3486
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:59,158
really the Forefront of the of Bio

3487
02:07:57,118 --> 02:08:01,859
control it's you know not for some past

3488
02:07:59,158 --> 02:08:03,000
like aphids and white fly or white fly a

3489
02:08:01,859 --> 02:08:04,920
little bit but

3490
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,060
um just because they're really they're

3491
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:09,539
cost effective because they're quite

3492
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:11,639
inexpensive to rear and

3493
02:08:09,539 --> 02:08:14,279
um versus like if you're using some of

3494
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:15,659
the other you know macro type of BIOS

3495
02:08:14,279 --> 02:08:18,059
like a parasitic watch and stuff

3496
02:08:15,658 --> 02:08:20,279
generally they've got to uh be reared on

3497
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:21,599
a pest and that's cost prohibitive

3498
02:08:20,279 --> 02:08:24,479
because you've got a greenhouse with a

3499
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:26,579
crop in it then you gotta pass it so I'm

3500
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:28,319
gonna guess that probably more along

3501
02:08:26,579 --> 02:08:30,420
those lines of rearing stuff on

3502
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:32,639
fictitious hosts

3503
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:36,079
um is going to be the future and

3504
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:38,279
possibly some new you know new

3505
02:08:36,079 --> 02:08:40,260
Biologicals that

3506
02:08:38,279 --> 02:08:41,698
um you know maybe there's a new a

3507
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:43,619
different parasitic wasp it doesn't

3508
02:08:41,698 --> 02:08:45,598
exist it isn't commercialized right now

3509
02:08:43,618 --> 02:08:47,880
that's really good on you know better on

3510
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:50,819
cannabis aphid or a different Predator

3511
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:52,500
might that's really good on hemp for us

3512
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:55,198
it might always stuff like that in the

3513
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:56,520
future but that yeah I just sell them

3514
02:08:55,198 --> 02:08:58,019
they tell me that when everyone is ready

3515
02:08:56,520 --> 02:09:00,300
to sell I don't get too much of the

3516
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:01,860
privy on the on the behind the scenes

3517
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,179
the r d and sorry what was the other

3518
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:05,219
part of your question

3519
02:09:03,179 --> 02:09:08,340
for that one I I guess the other

3520
02:09:05,219 --> 02:09:10,560
question was do you think these sort of

3521
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:12,539
features like for example the proof of

3522
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:15,780
predation and things like that will sort

3523
02:09:12,539 --> 02:09:18,238
of start to become integrated as sort of

3524
02:09:15,779 --> 02:09:20,158
Mainstays in predators to or do you

3525
02:09:18,238 --> 02:09:22,198
think that's just a one-off sort of

3526
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:23,939
situation

3527
02:09:22,198 --> 02:09:25,439
yeah I think that's just a one-off I

3528
02:09:23,939 --> 02:09:26,879
mean that proof of prediction is there

3529
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:29,158
it's just left noticeable I think it's

3530
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:31,020
more that people are gonna like we're

3531
02:09:29,158 --> 02:09:32,819
really at an infant level especially in

3532
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:35,699
the Cannabis industry in understanding

3533
02:09:32,819 --> 02:09:37,198
bio control like Kansas people think

3534
02:09:35,698 --> 02:09:39,779
they're so Innovative but honestly like

3535
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:41,419
most of the other crops are years ahead

3536
02:09:39,779 --> 02:09:43,019
of them when it comes to understanding

3537
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:44,639
biocontrol because they've just been

3538
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:46,920
using it for a long time so for instance

3539
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:49,260
that same proof of predation I mean you

3540
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:51,359
can see with swersky May that it changes

3541
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:53,699
color depending on which past

3542
02:09:51,359 --> 02:09:55,079
um it has like I can look in a crop and

3543
02:09:53,698 --> 02:09:56,219
look at the color of your swirsky and

3544
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:59,399
tell you whether you get a pest problem

3545
02:09:56,219 --> 02:10:01,380
or not because of the shade of Amber it

3546
02:09:59,399 --> 02:10:02,819
is but you know there's lots of stuff

3547
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:03,659
like that

3548
02:10:02,819 --> 02:10:05,039
um

3549
02:10:03,658 --> 02:10:07,379
so I think that just the general

3550
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:09,479
understanding has a lot of room to to

3551
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:11,880
come up I think most people are not at

3552
02:10:09,479 --> 02:10:13,979
it it's really it's changed rapidly in

3553
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:16,079
cannabis you know in those years because

3554
02:10:13,979 --> 02:10:18,419
that's the first time where I said a lot

3555
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:20,399
of the industry I'd say is a little bit

3556
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:22,139
maybe a head is the wrong word but the

3557
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:23,519
Cannabis industry has definitely evolved

3558
02:10:22,139 --> 02:10:24,840
way faster because it's the only

3559
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,420
industry where they literally got like

3560
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:29,099
some dude with a PhD in BIO control

3561
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:31,260
that's running their bio control thing

3562
02:10:29,099 --> 02:10:32,520
but it's just it's a newer crop right so

3563
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:35,340
it wasn't that common before

3564
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:38,159
legalization to use bio control time

3565
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:40,560
yeah okay yeah that's that makes sense

3566
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:42,118
for sure it's it's definitely a new crop

3567
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:45,060
where not everything is the same as

3568
02:10:42,118 --> 02:10:47,158
prior one of the sort of final questions

3569
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:48,860
I wanted to ask you that was of personal

3570
02:10:47,158 --> 02:10:51,299
interest to me because I am

3571
02:10:48,859 --> 02:10:54,359
unapologetically biased towards organic

3572
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:56,940
growth styles do you think that organic

3573
02:10:54,359 --> 02:10:59,039
growth Styles sort of have a innate

3574
02:10:56,939 --> 02:11:01,198
better chance to fight off pests than

3575
02:10:59,039 --> 02:11:03,719
coco or do you think it's relatively an

3576
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:05,539
even Battlefield

3577
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:09,000
oh man you're trying to make an internet

3578
02:11:05,539 --> 02:11:12,719
uh give me some internet heaters views

3579
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:14,340
expressed a minor loan and not yours so

3580
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:16,739
this is going to get a whole lot of hate

3581
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:18,179
but I would say unanimously and Cobra's

3582
02:11:16,738 --> 02:11:19,198
like a big company so like we're all

3583
02:11:18,179 --> 02:11:21,000
over the world and there's like

3584
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:23,098
literally some of the top best control

3585
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,639
people in the world work for us

3586
02:11:23,099 --> 02:11:28,440
I would say pretty much unanimously

3587
02:11:25,639 --> 02:11:30,118
everyone that I work with in Copper and

3588
02:11:28,439 --> 02:11:32,519
in commercial green henders thinks

3589
02:11:30,118 --> 02:11:33,059
that's largely a bunch of hokey

3590
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:35,639
um

3591
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:37,199
I have not seen that I think it's

3592
02:11:35,639 --> 02:11:38,219
probably like most things there's a bit

3593
02:11:37,198 --> 02:11:40,678
of

3594
02:11:38,219 --> 02:11:43,679
both things I've honestly seen the most

3595
02:11:40,679 --> 02:11:45,420
pest infested crops as a general rule

3596
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:47,039
are the organic ones not a conventional

3597
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:48,420
ones and I'm an organic guy I really

3598
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:50,158
believe in organic agriculture I'm just

3599
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:54,060
telling you the truth and I think what

3600
02:11:50,158 --> 02:11:55,618
agriculture people miss about organic

3601
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:58,380
stuff is like one of the missing links

3602
02:11:55,618 --> 02:12:00,598
is like the nutrition levels like so you

3603
02:11:58,380 --> 02:12:01,920
get a plant it's very hard to dial in

3604
02:12:00,599 --> 02:12:03,900
the nutrition especially in the

3605
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:06,480
greenhouse or indoors where it's like a

3606
02:12:03,899 --> 02:12:09,179
really intensive you know lighting

3607
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:12,000
regime and stuff like that to get a

3608
02:12:09,179 --> 02:12:14,940
properly dialed in

3609
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,819
um plant for nutrients in my opinion is

3610
02:12:14,939 --> 02:12:19,319
way easier with synthetic and best with

3611
02:12:17,819 --> 02:12:21,179
synthetic fertilizers and you'll see

3612
02:12:19,319 --> 02:12:22,618
even if you've ever read Steve Solomon's

3613
02:12:21,179 --> 02:12:24,179
book who's one of the you know gurus of

3614
02:12:22,618 --> 02:12:25,679
organic it's one of the things that he

3615
02:12:24,179 --> 02:12:27,658
discovers once you start looking into

3616
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:29,760
like the nutritional value of organic

3617
02:12:27,658 --> 02:12:31,460
food yeah it doesn't have pesticide

3618
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:33,539
residues and it's probably got a lot of

3619
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:35,880
attributes for like you know maybe it's

3620
02:12:33,539 --> 02:12:37,260
got higher antioxidants and stuff but

3621
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:39,239
when you start looking at like okay well

3622
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:42,360
how much calcium does it have in it or

3623
02:12:39,238 --> 02:12:44,098
how much phosphorus does it have in it

3624
02:12:42,359 --> 02:12:46,618
a lot of times the organic stuff is

3625
02:12:44,099 --> 02:12:47,880
really low compared to synthetic not

3626
02:12:46,618 --> 02:12:50,460
that it's not possible but that's just

3627
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:51,599
the reality so I think that's part of

3628
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:53,158
the time I get healthy like I said I

3629
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:56,760
think a healthy plant is more resistant

3630
02:12:53,158 --> 02:12:58,979
to diseases but I think or pests and

3631
02:12:56,760 --> 02:13:01,020
diseases but I also think it's it's

3632
02:12:58,979 --> 02:13:03,059
definitely over inflated I'm not

3633
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:04,099
claiming to be an expert all right

3634
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:08,280
you know

3635
02:13:04,099 --> 02:13:10,078
the the word but like I've seen I there

3636
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:11,939
might be something to it but when you

3637
02:13:10,078 --> 02:13:13,738
see like I've Just Seen thousands and

3638
02:13:11,939 --> 02:13:14,879
thousands and thousands of Acres of

3639
02:13:13,738 --> 02:13:17,098
crops

3640
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:18,960
and a lot of times pastas show up

3641
02:13:17,099 --> 02:13:20,819
willy-nilly they're not necessarily

3642
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:22,439
going for the weakest plant that does

3643
02:13:20,819 --> 02:13:24,658
happen sometimes but a lot of times it's

3644
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:27,259
just like they just show up randomly so

3645
02:13:24,658 --> 02:13:29,939
let's say it's not as true as everybody

3646
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:31,320
thinks and I think a lot of it comes

3647
02:13:29,939 --> 02:13:33,059
down it's not to do with whether it's

3648
02:13:31,319 --> 02:13:35,880
organic or conventional it's to do with

3649
02:13:33,060 --> 02:13:38,340
what the nutrition level is in the plant

3650
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:40,078
that actually makes sense I want I want

3651
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:42,539
to believe man I literally have come

3652
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:47,819
from that like I I literally was in

3653
02:13:42,539 --> 02:13:49,500
Amsterdam in like 95 when uh positronics

3654
02:13:47,819 --> 02:13:52,259
used to do like T they were like the

3655
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:54,118
original Proprietors of of no-till I was

3656
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:55,260
there like I learned from those guys and

3657
02:13:54,118 --> 02:13:57,658
I actually

3658
02:13:55,260 --> 02:14:00,239
I'm a no-till non-believer I'll just

3659
02:13:57,658 --> 02:14:02,098
I'll just say it not a non-believer but

3660
02:14:00,238 --> 02:14:06,539
I've been there and I've left and I will

3661
02:14:02,099 --> 02:14:08,520
never go back I just I think there's a

3662
02:14:06,539 --> 02:14:11,099
lot of I'm not convinced that that's the

3663
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,420
best plan on multiple levels and I know

3664
02:14:11,099 --> 02:14:15,060
that's a

3665
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:18,599
heavily highly unpopular opinion but

3666
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:21,360
that's my No that's good and you know it

3667
02:14:18,599 --> 02:14:22,619
also it makes me start thinking that you

3668
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:24,658
know there's sort of a lot of variables

3669
02:14:22,618 --> 02:14:26,279
in the equation because as you said it

3670
02:14:24,658 --> 02:14:27,960
actually totally makes sense to me that

3671
02:14:26,279 --> 02:14:30,420
the worst Gardens you see with

3672
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:32,578
infestations are organic because if

3673
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:34,500
they're utilizing the things we've

3674
02:14:32,578 --> 02:14:36,539
touched on earlier like neem and things

3675
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:38,340
like that in an attempt to stay organic

3676
02:14:36,539 --> 02:14:40,618
but uh you know maybe somewhat

3677
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:43,560
ineffective whereas maybe you know the

3678
02:14:40,618 --> 02:14:45,598
soilless guys are a little more ready to

3679
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:47,760
use some of the more bang for your buck

3680
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:49,319
type principles be a pesticides things

3681
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:51,239
like that but that's interesting to know

3682
02:14:49,319 --> 02:14:53,219
and it's good to hear because it's sort

3683
02:14:51,238 --> 02:14:55,738
of for a long time I've been wondering

3684
02:14:53,219 --> 02:14:57,960
why the biggest producers are all

3685
02:14:55,738 --> 02:15:00,299
soilless so that's probably a pretty

3686
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:02,340
good reason why right like it's just it

3687
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:03,599
plays into it I think well I think

3688
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:05,760
there's a bunch of reasons I personally

3689
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:08,279
like where if my general beliefs in just

3690
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:10,560
agriculture which like I said I've been

3691
02:15:08,279 --> 02:15:13,380
in it for like probably around 30 years

3692
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:15,179
or more and it's kind of evolved every

3693
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:18,659
time I've been a pure organic guy in

3694
02:15:15,179 --> 02:15:20,279
some cases and pure synthetic and

3695
02:15:18,658 --> 02:15:22,138
honestly when it comes to whether it's

3696
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:22,738
Plant Nutrition

3697
02:15:22,139 --> 02:15:25,800
um

3698
02:15:22,738 --> 02:15:27,718
human nutrition or Pest Control pests

3699
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:29,400
and Disease Control I'm really a really

3700
02:15:27,719 --> 02:15:31,020
and I think and covert also is we're

3701
02:15:29,399 --> 02:15:33,598
really firm Believers in integrated

3702
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:36,139
where I don't think that pure organic is

3703
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:38,400
the solution and I don't think that pure

3704
02:15:36,139 --> 02:15:41,578
conventional is their synthetic

3705
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:43,138
Association I think the real answer is a

3706
02:15:41,578 --> 02:15:44,759
combination of the two I think there's

3707
02:15:43,139 --> 02:15:46,560
some really good things that Organics

3708
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:47,880
brings to the table and I think there's

3709
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:51,300
some really good things that just

3710
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:53,699
putting chemical salts can bring to the

3711
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:55,199
table in in some situations and it's

3712
02:15:53,698 --> 02:15:56,519
really the same with bio control like a

3713
02:15:55,198 --> 02:15:58,379
lot of people think that Cobra's like

3714
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:59,400
where oh the corporate guy or the bio

3715
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:02,279
control guy he's always going to push

3716
02:15:59,399 --> 02:16:03,960
bios we don't really believe in pure bio

3717
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:05,399
control there's basically nobody in our

3718
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:07,020
company that believes in that we really

3719
02:16:05,399 --> 02:16:08,339
believe in integrated

3720
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:10,139
um like there's a ton there's certain

3721
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:12,300
paths there is just probably never going

3722
02:16:10,139 --> 02:16:14,520
to be a great bio control solution

3723
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:17,279
you're going to need to whatever use a

3724
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:19,139
physical means or or a spray or

3725
02:16:17,279 --> 02:16:20,939
something like that and I think that's

3726
02:16:19,139 --> 02:16:23,099
that's kind of my view on agriculture

3727
02:16:20,939 --> 02:16:24,719
it's really everything's integrated and

3728
02:16:23,099 --> 02:16:27,078
whenever somebody gets too far into

3729
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:31,260
their that's their belief system

3730
02:16:27,078 --> 02:16:33,659
integrated their ideas too much it's

3731
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:35,280
it's not necessarily the best thing and

3732
02:16:33,659 --> 02:16:37,619
I'd also say part of the reason why some

3733
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:39,000
of those organic places that I've seen

3734
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:40,979
like I've seen some really filthy

3735
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:42,540
organic places filthy synthetic places

3736
02:16:40,978 --> 02:16:44,879
too but

3737
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:47,099
I'd say part of the factor in those

3738
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:48,539
organic things is the magic factor is

3739
02:16:47,099 --> 02:16:50,639
they want to believe that everything's

3740
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:52,080
magically taking care of itself and they

3741
02:16:50,638 --> 02:16:53,579
just don't even look and then you go

3742
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:55,379
like I always remember I won't mention

3743
02:16:53,579 --> 02:16:57,120
any names or there's one other guys in

3744
02:16:55,379 --> 02:16:58,679
Canada it was literally one of the most

3745
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:00,240
famous organic people here he was one of

3746
02:16:58,679 --> 02:17:03,120
the pioneers and I was friends with him

3747
02:17:00,239 --> 02:17:05,099
from before I was in Copper and he said

3748
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:07,139
he invited us out to the greenhouse just

3749
02:17:05,099 --> 02:17:08,460
because we're friends and he's like I'll

3750
02:17:07,138 --> 02:17:10,018
go take a look he says I'll tell you up

3751
02:17:08,459 --> 02:17:12,119
front there's nothing to see there

3752
02:17:10,019 --> 02:17:13,800
because you know the magic Factor you

3753
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:15,420
know we've been organic for so long and

3754
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:17,340
everything self-regulates and it's all

3755
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:19,079
in balance and it was the filthiest crop

3756
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:21,478
I've ever seen and this was a place that

3757
02:17:19,079 --> 02:17:23,718
literally that was the highest the most

3758
02:17:21,478 --> 02:17:27,000
expensive produce in the time in Canada

3759
02:17:23,718 --> 02:17:29,759
and it was absolutely filthy and it was

3760
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,859
because he he believed that he was clean

3761
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:33,478
and chefs probably believe that it was

3762
02:17:31,859 --> 02:17:35,099
Queen because he keeps telling him how

3763
02:17:33,478 --> 02:17:37,379
magic everything was so

3764
02:17:35,099 --> 02:17:40,799
I'm kind of a I don't know become more

3765
02:17:37,379 --> 02:17:42,539
of a practical practical sword for over

3766
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:45,539
over the years

3767
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:47,760
yeah no I I'm on board I'm on board I'm

3768
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:49,500
inherent biases make fools of us all

3769
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:51,059
right that's really interesting to hear

3770
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:53,099
that that's how it sort of played out

3771
02:17:51,058 --> 02:17:56,340
for you I will have to keep that in mind

3772
02:17:53,099 --> 02:17:58,500
but um with that being said I think that

3773
02:17:56,340 --> 02:18:00,058
pretty much brings us to the end of what

3774
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:01,978
I was hoping to chat about did you have

3775
02:18:00,058 --> 02:18:03,420
any comments or shout outs you wanted to

3776
02:18:01,978 --> 02:18:05,579
make

3777
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:07,620
um no no no real comments uh shout outs

3778
02:18:05,579 --> 02:18:09,239
to all the people that like bringing us

3779
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:10,260
new bio controls and new technologies

3780
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:12,840
because I think those are the people

3781
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:13,978
that they get underrated a lot of

3782
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:15,659
everyone doesn't I don't think most

3783
02:18:13,978 --> 02:18:18,000
people realize how much work goes into

3784
02:18:15,659 --> 02:18:19,920
bringing new products

3785
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,718
um to Market those are kind of the under

3786
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:23,700
pressure people so shout out to all the

3787
02:18:21,718 --> 02:18:26,339
r d people they're locked away in a lab

3788
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:29,219
somewhere coming up with Solutions

3789
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:31,019
