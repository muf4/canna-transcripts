to be here I'm really happy to have a

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,448
nice conversation with you awesome so

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,030
the first question I like to start off

19
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,558
every interview with is what was your

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,820
first experience with cannabis you know

21
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:08,789
how did you get introduced to it huh I

22
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,188
mean that's a good question you know

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,080
when I was a teenager people were

24
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:16,079
smoking and I think you know that was

25
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,908
like the mid late 80s and there was a

26
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,920
lot of good strains around but I never

27
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,640
really connected with cannabis I was

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,909
really into I was really into like

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,799
ancestral shamanic herbalism and so I

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,000
kind of thought cannabis was just kind

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,890
of ho-hum and petty and that's what

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,390
everybody else did and I you know I was

33
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,859
really into getting that of the jungle

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,570
catalogs and the church of Tree of Life

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,269
and ordering all these strange and

36
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,938
unique plants and try those and I was

37
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:45,109
you know I really enjoyed mushrooms was

38
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:49,139
a big one and cactus and I really never

39
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:51,359
got the full download from cannabis

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,890
early on I smoked it once or twice and

41
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,159
didn't really do anything and I really

42
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,460
didn't find that deep connection until

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,549
on one of my journeys with one of my

44
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,129
friends and we were in Belize and the I

45
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,630
think it was right around the 90s you

46
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:07,769
know it was kind of it was a little bit

47
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:09,689
rough and tumble I think were the only

48
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,489
white people there and you were just you

49
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,318
know Aaron I think I was 20 and we were

50
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,090
just we just cruise around

51
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,828
bumble around you know and out of care

52
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,479
in the world no no clue that it's pretty

53
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:21,359
dangerous it's like the height of the

54
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,858
crack era and that's when I was like

55
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:25,590
let's get some you know let's get some

56
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:27,810
pot before we go to the you know the

57
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,098
Mayan ruins and I'm like okay and so we

58
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,420
bumbled around and so we found this

59
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,919
Rasta guy and you let us through all

60
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:35,339
these places and I'm sure it was so

61
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:40,589
sketchy and eventually we got this

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,030
little foil-wrapped ganja and we you

63
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,280
know we paid the guy who scurried off

64
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,650
and we kept it with us

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,049
and my friend actually when we finally

66
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,639
made it to I believe us to call he's

67
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,349
like hey you want to try this this is

68
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,310
funny and I'm like you know yeah the

69
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:57,899
students and that's when I got it like I

70
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,598
it was when I finally realized that

71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,359
cannabis is like nature's Wi-Fi it's

72
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,238
like it is the plant that allows us to

73
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:09,750
connect with all of creation on a really

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,569
subtle deep human and plant-based level

75
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,780
it's just I really understood that this

76
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:17,578
is like the link that keeps us bound to

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,938
the our garden planet it's like it is

78
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,889
it's almost like our plant ally supreme

79
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:25,289
it's almost like you know I explained I

80
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,669
just I got it and you know cannabis was

81
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,668
good I would smoke it here and there and

82
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,500
then I really really got the download

83
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,090
from it when I was in the Himalayas and

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,889
they called cultures with the Baba's in

85
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,419
the hash and they're rubbing and when I

86
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,629
smoked in the Himalayas like I was

87
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,979
hooked and I knew that this was my one

88
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:43,138
of my fasten and it also kind of links

89
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,989
back to when I was doing a lot i wass

90
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,209
car and I had these visions in the you

91
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,069
know and the plant fire WASC it was like

92
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,989
you know you're meant to work with

93
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,578
plants but it's not ayahuasca it's

94
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,719
another plant and that means are all

95
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,329
stories with those stories they call if

96
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,180
you linked up but it's just through a

97
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:04,019
series of deeper evidence for nature and

98
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,069
plants and people I it awakened in me

99
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:11,188
this connection with cannabis and I

100
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:15,560
don't know I I guess that's the first

101
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:18,329
time would be maybe at those temples so

102
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,629
do you think for people who maybe have

103
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,550
more of that mainstream connection to

104
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,500
cannabis and maybe haven't found their

105
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,360
spiritual connection with it do you

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,459
think that maybe trying to

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,229
I paid in you know such an activity

108
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,288
would be a good way to try to you know

109
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:35,459
reestablish that link within yourself

110
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:36,990
yeah I almost think it's for people that

111
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,089
are kind of lost that link or can't find

112
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,490
that link and I think any working with

113
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:43,019
cannabis in any way could be totally

114
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,569
Monday and it could be spiritually could

115
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,968
be just commercial I mean I always like

116
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:50,370
the thing now it's like is all the guys

117
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:52,680
all the bros now that grow cannabis and

118
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,728
basically they're caring for this female

119
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,319
plant and they're creating this

120
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:56,818
relationship it's like almost nourishing

121
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,379
their feminine it's getting them in the

122
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,729
garden and when everybody says oh it's a

123
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,009
gateway drug and I'm like yeah it's a

124
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:04,709
gateway drug to gardening you know maybe

125
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:07,020
the front the fridge had a few other

126
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:09,060
things but I think any way you interact

127
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,620
with it and I always wonder you know

128
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,089
maybe back in the 20s if it wasn't

129
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,709
demonized and it wasn't scheduled and it

130
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,359
wasn't run out what the world would be

131
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:16,649
like today if we had cannabis for like

132
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,689
the last whatever it was a hundred

133
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,579
eighty years it would be a totally

134
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,750
different world I think you know I think

135
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,399
there would be a lot more compassion

136
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,899
there would be a lot more art there

137
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,478
would be a lot more connection to nature

138
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,310
and each other I think it's just this

139
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,158
it's this amazing force that's kind of

140
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,658
coming back to reclaim who we really are

141
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:39,360
as stewards of this amazing place okay

142
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:40,949
and so I mean you mentioned mushrooms

143
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,979
and on your Instagram I've seen things

144
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:47,158
like tobacco and poppies where these

145
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:49,620
other kind of ethno botanical plants sit

146
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:51,240
in regards to cannabis phew you know do

147
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
they all kind of sit on the same shelf

148
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,848
or do you use them for different

149
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,800
purposes I think you know they're they

150
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:01,259
they're all tapping into it like a

151
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,139
similar place but on a different kind of

152
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,838
wavelength and you know I I don't really

153
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,150
like real poppies once in a while more

154
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:12,180
for the beauty I'm not a it's not really

155
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:13,620
my thing and tobacco I enjoy to certain

156
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,949
my like prayers after the creation

157
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,009
matrix maybe once or twice a month and

158
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:22,408
mostly I grow it for the beauty and it

159
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,729
really is a protector plant so I love to

160
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,769
plant it all around the house all around

161
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:28,468
the gardens and I think it has a really

162
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:29,639
deep connection in India a lot of times

163
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:34,379
I know a lot of people like to smoke

164
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:36,449
cannabis and tobacco together and I see

165
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,399
where you know maybe eight weeks out the

166
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:41,139
flavor and dadada but there is a

167
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,689
beautiful kind of connection whereas too

168
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,370
a very male plant and cannabis is a very

169
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,100
female so you put those together and you

170
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,199
have like a coated kind of combination

171
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,850
and a lot of the Baba's and Saudis in

172
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,990
India and the Himalayas they mix those

173
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,910
two along with other herbs

174
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,620
interesting analogy around the you know

175
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,470
the kind of unification of the male and

176
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,459
the female plant do you find that mixing

177
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:08,980
tobacco and cannabis is kind of overall

178
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:12,969
a better few or it's just better for a

179
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,220
certain purpose I think if that's your

180
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,110
you know I I think whatever works for

181
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,310
people whatever gets them to the place

182
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,259
that need to be to find those

183
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,240
realizations is great and beautiful for

184
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:24,969
them personally for me I don't usually

185
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,199
mix them unless I'm in a place you know

186
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,210
if I'm in the Himalayas a lot of time

187
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,769
everybody's mixing so I just go with it

188
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:33,729
and I'm usually addicted to nicotine by

189
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:36,459
the end of the trek but you know the

190
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,960
their plants there's also a lot of other

191
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:39,849
plants that people mix in there's like a

192
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,359
calamus it's called vodka and it cools

193
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:46,000
the smoke there's a Himalayan shamanic

194
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,770
recipe where they use a mugwort and

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,610
night blooming jasmine flowers with the

196
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:53,620
hash like there's a lot of alchemical

197
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,160
blending of herbs that can really push

198
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,850
the cannabis experience into a more

199
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,830
focused kind of beam that makes sense

200
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,850
I'm try not to be too esoteric but

201
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,709
there's a lot of herbs that can

202
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,300
helpfully they say like Bridal kind of

203
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,219
like you would put a saddle on a horse

204
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,860
it allows you to write it better it

205
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,680
allows you to go someplace longer

206
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,030
without fatigue I mean I think it's a

207
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,290
unique thing and I don't think people of

208
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,689
so got into it there's a lot of

209
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,189
artisanal hash making and a lot of

210
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:23,800
really neat things but you don't see too

211
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:25,060
many blending philosophies except maybe

212
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,280
in pens where people are putting in

213
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,980
straight terpenes and such but it's all

214
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,809
alchemor I mean really alchemical when

215
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,970
it's nature but I kind of just like it

216
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:39,940
straight straight up as buds in my pipe

217
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:41,290
okay and so are there any kind of

218
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,330
additives that are commonly available

219
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,439
you might recommend people could give a

220
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,440
try if they're interested

221
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:52,580
there's genrih ways um what is the name

222
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,829
of that one or if there's one herb

223
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,259
that's really unique it's an I think

224
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:02,930
it's actually an Australian herb and use

225
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:04,819
a powder I think it's kind of uh not not

226
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:10,338
a cactus and not a plant what's its that

227
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:12,769
was kind of like a succulent yeah what's

228
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,570
it called Oh Cana you can take Cana

229
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:18,799
powder and put it on cannabis and it

230
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,839
will erase the the feelings of like

231
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,759
paranoia and you know people that get

232
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,279
edgy on cannabis and they just can't

233
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:30,230
handle it it'll really take the edge off

234
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:32,778
and in India they use bachi which is

235
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,240
calamus and that bridles the plant and

236
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:37,939
cools it for smoking and it also keeps

237
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,339
it from getting too out there it kind of

238
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,560
keeps it kind of focused and what else

239
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,839
there's a lot of shamanic recipes I know

240
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,979
the one in I really I tried to make my

241
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,610
own version of the night blooming

242
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,379
jasmine mugwort and hash but I couldn't

243
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,519
get it really right so I think that's

244
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:55,490
gonna be in the future I'll try that one

245
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,110
again but you know there's a lot of

246
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,370
Native American herbs that are really

247
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,870
good like that all help out lobelia and

248
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,839
Moline lots of things to cool the smoke

249
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,700
and nourish the lungs I think it's a

250
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,079
whole realm that people really need to

251
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,600
explore because they're you know there's

252
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:17,870
so much to it you know without and so do

253
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,490
you find that you're able to treat a lot

254
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,409
of the things that are bothering you

255
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,709
with this more kind of natural approach

256
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:27,379
or do you still use some kind of Western

257
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,669
medicines so to speak I use like a

258
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:29,659
Western allopathic medicine as an

259
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,149
emergency medicine

260
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:34,969
I don't think it has it really treats

261
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:38,720
the problem and not the root cause of

262
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:42,860
things and so I don't I really enjoy a

263
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,139
lot of the ancestral herbalism and like

264
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,528
traditional Chinese medicine are even

265
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,838
aid any kind of thing that's working

266
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:52,720
with meridians energy plants minerals

267
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,399
things that are really taking the body

268
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,250
as a whole and also taking into

269
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:02,789
consideration things like mental states

270
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,009
you know even environment geography I

271
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:07,949
think everything plays into healing but

272
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:10,110
I think cannabis is our primary healing

273
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,509
plant it's kind of like the dog version

274
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,720
of a plant it's like the thing that that

275
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:19,700
is right there for us you know on every

276
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,430
level from medical recreational

277
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:28,560
spiritual you know it covers all the

278
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:30,750
bases okay so with that being said the

279
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,059
first strain you ever bred was that

280
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,379
trying to create something medical

281
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:38,069
something that's going to help you to

282
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:39,750
better tap in to these kind of you know

283
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,300
streams of consciousness if you want to

284
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,659
give it that term or was it more of a

285
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,179
happy accident so to speak I think the

286
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:51,799
first time it kind of really it was a

287
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:54,659
happy accident I think I got some seeds

288
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,490
from Marc Emery we went up and got some

289
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:00,360
seeds one time a long time ago up in

290
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:03,149
Canada and which was but hermaphrodite

291
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,830
'add I think it was a feminized one and

292
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,439
I got seeds and I was like oh this is

293
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,570
amazing so this is so easy I could do

294
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,950
this and I'm like you know and I I kind

295
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,110
of played around and crew those out and

296
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,850
and said wow this is really unique it's

297
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,830
like it's because before that I was

298
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,750
really into DJing and making music and

299
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,339
blending things on that level in the

300
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,649
realm of therapy so I was like wow I can

301
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,820
take different could totally unique and

302
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,669
different plants and bring them together

303
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,410
to make some in this kind of Union or

304
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:29,549
love to make brand new things and I

305
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:31,409
thought that was the most ultimate

306
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,750
beautiful thing and then that kind of

307
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:36,959
started my seed addiction and then I

308
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,029
just went from there so who were the

309
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,889
first breeders you were buying when you

310
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,659
develop your seed addiction I mean the

311
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,980
reason I ask that is because I'm sure a

312
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,379
lot of people listening who buy your

313
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,779
seeds it probably themselves consider

314
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,189
that they have a seed addiction so it's

315
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,490
always interesting to know you know who

316
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,950
is the breeders breeder I don't know you

317
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,370
know what I used to kind of pour over

318
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,710
those old catalogs you know and I always

319
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,659
looked and I would like go over them and

320
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,639
like finding it I get my little magic

321
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,019
marker and circle all the ones I get and

322
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,129
of course I you know I didn't I didn't

323
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,329
have a lot of money so I can only get

324
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:13,110
one or two but I would kind of go

325
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,550
looking at descriptions in

326
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,769
kind of look for ones that kind of I

327
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:19,169
felt jive with me and it was funny it

328
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,139
was a some of the flying old flying

329
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:24,599
dutchman men like the suma con Dios and

330
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,429
DJ shorts ones always intrigued me

331
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,230
because especially the f13 is like it's

332
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:29,549
a real bell ringer I'm like a cool bell

333
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,920
ringer that sounds right up my alley and

334
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,809
anything kind of weird and unique and

335
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,449
special I always look for a kind of like

336
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:38,849
a extreme possibilities I always look

337
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,640
kind of fruit for me I enjoy like the

338
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,950
ruling fringe cannabis like the really

339
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,689
unique odd weird maybe doesn't look that

340
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,670
great maybe doesn't grow that great but

341
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,310
it has a you know unique effects and

342
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:52,588
even its own unique kind of spirit okay

343
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:54,659
so I mean the first question that comes

344
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:56,880
to mind with that is is you mentioned

345
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,708
you had the seed bank catalog so that's

346
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,088
interesting I I know that you've

347
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,979
actually got quite an impressive

348
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,260
collection of seed bank catalogs from

349
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,120
years gone by was that like an

350
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,860
intentional hobby or due to just kind of

351
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,500
workout that you happen to accumulate

352
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,329
them you know I've always been like a

353
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,799
treasure hunter and treasure gatherer

354
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:15,958
and so anything that I'm passionate

355
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,359
about I really love like you know I

356
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,069
collect records too so if I you know you

357
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,110
saw always in books like books are my

358
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,610
first passion and then from there in

359
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,289
winter records and then when I wanted

360
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,169
seeds I started selling my books and

361
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:30,360
records to get seeds so you know it's

362
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:31,649
kind of morphs you know isolate crystals

363
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,620
but not so much anymore because I kind

364
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:37,049
of feel bad for the planet but I don't

365
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,399
you know I just love to gather and

366
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:41,250
collect things that I'm passionate about

367
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,589
and some other all those catalogs are so

368
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,299
unique and so fun and I don't know it

369
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,430
brings me a lot of joy so I can just eat

370
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:50,129
out you know you'd be the perfect person

371
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:52,979
to ask this question to I've long since

372
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:55,409
held the view that that photo of Neville

373
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,000
in the hash then holding the the Brix of

374
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:59,039
hash you know I think that's the most

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,078
like chronic photo in cannabis culture

376
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,689
so to speak but you've probably got a

377
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,578
far better having seen you know more

378
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,750
magazines and I have do you agree with

379
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:08,370
that always there are another photo

380
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,278
which kind of stands out a bit more for

381
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,600
you I don't know you know I I love all

382
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,730
those photos I especially you know I

383
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,320
always loved the Saudis like smoking the

384
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,180
Chilam those always got me they always

385
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,740
look so like regal and and like divine

386
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,778
and devout and just the plumes of smoke

387
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,639
but I totally agree with that that

388
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:29,850
picture of Neville and the crazy

389
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,120
thing is through synchronicity I met the

390
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:36,990
guy who took that picture really was he

391
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,750
an Afghan guy no no actually never this

392
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,639
is like this is a story in itself

393
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,409
Neville took along a photographer when

394
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,899
he went on and he's and kind of like a

395
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,120
sidekick like a Batman Robin situation

396
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:52,500
on his famous trip that went through

397
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,210
Pakistan or India and Nepal and and his

398
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,370
name was Steve and Steve took that

399
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:59,460
picture and that's where I kind of got

400
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,560
that first eighty five seed bank catalog

401
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,139
from him because he still had a bunch

402
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,359
left and he would tell me some wild

403
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,529
stories and yeah he actually took that

404
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,019
picture and actually all the pictures in

405
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:13,169
that catalog Wow

406
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,879
just as a bit of a Australian pride

407
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:16,919
question where do you where do you sit

408
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:21,600
Neville in the hierarchy of breeders

409
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:26,039
throughout history so to speak knowing

410
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,080
some of the deeper human stories of him

411
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:31,049
I mean I I try not to put anybody on a

412
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,520
pedestal he definitely was a primordial

413
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:39,000
like archetype for gathering and

414
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,649
dispensing and creating like I don't

415
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,960
know kind of like all he was almost like

416
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:46,559
Isis eating out of him himself and he

417
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,440
kind of bloomed in in the Dutch scene

418
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,469
and really through passion and drive he

419
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,300
collected seeds from America from all

420
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,490
over from Southeast Asia Central Asia

421
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,049
and really kind of jump-started that

422
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,210
whole movement I mean along with sensi

423
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:01,799
and some of the older guys I mean you

424
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,570
know I mean you can say good about him

425
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,789
you can say bad I think he was an

426
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,820
amazing guy and I would love to see him

427
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:10,769
kind of come back out and and really

428
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,349
shine again because you know I really

429
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:15,389
believe in respecting and nourishing our

430
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,889
elders and the people that come before

431
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,360
us because there's a lot of knowledge

432
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,910
and there's a lot of information and

433
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,969
there's a lot of there's just a lot of I

434
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,850
don't know good mojo in that and so I

435
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,410
think novels a pretty cool guy and I

436
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,049
mean maybe he's a bit of a two-parter

437
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,950
I've heard some rumors that he is

438
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,740
considering maybe doing more things

439
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,660
within the scene if he were to come back

440
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,279
would you would he be the type of person

441
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,290
he would want to work with and then as I

442
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,430
follow up which breeders would you want

443
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,170
to

444
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,880
work within like a collaborative sense

445
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,019
you know are there any who you really

446
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,550
kind of did what they're doing and you

447
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:50,389
think together you could do some cool

448
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:52,399
stuff maybe you know I I kind of thought

449
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,590
about this I kind of work here and there

450
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,540
with friends or do stuff I four

451
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:58,549
commercially I don't really work with I

452
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,440
never really thought of it the only

453
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,480
thing I thought it was kind of like I

454
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,059
had a secret seed company that I was

455
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,390
starting called synergy and it was gonna

456
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:10,700
be working with all the breeders that I

457
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,740
kind of respected as one offs and all

458
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,330
the money would go to charity so each so

459
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,940
it's kind of like how you know that

460
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:18,230
collab with glass they come up with

461
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,820
these one collapse of glass and it's

462
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,470
like two famous glass artists and they

463
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:22,849
make this thing and that's it and it's

464
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,329
this beautiful piece so I thought if we

465
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:29,000
could if I could like find some of the

466
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:31,099
breeders that I really respect and we

467
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,079
can share Paul and our share of plants

468
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:34,819
and create maybe like two strains each

469
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,199
and each person gets to choose the

470
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:38,720
charity I thought that would be a really

471
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,519
unique way to to work with people and

472
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,140
make it for a good cause and then for

473
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,119
people I'd want to work with you know I

474
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,670
don't know because I don't want to like

475
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,219
say people and then not say enough

476
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,080
people and leave people out but anyone

477
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,620
that has a niche and it's passionate

478
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:58,639
about their work and really you know is

479
00:18:54,619 --> 00:19:00,679
so I don't know there's so many so many

480
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,509
people and so many respect and it's like

481
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,070
I almost don't want to start naming off

482
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,980
names does not want to leave anybody out

483
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:10,009
but I would say anyone that's passionate

484
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:13,700
has there has their skill set down has

485
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:15,950
the way that they worked down and is it

486
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,660
has a niche like has a an avenue that

487
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,450
they like to explore I would be more

488
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,700
than honored it's just I can barely keep

489
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:26,509
up with things here on my own since it's

490
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,670
just me and my wife I don't have time to

491
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:30,589
even brush my hair or brush my teeth tie

492
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,590
my shoes I swear every day just was IPPs

493
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:36,949
by and I get to come out at the Emerald

494
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:39,049
cup but I don't know I mean maybe later

495
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,549
maybe I'll come up with some names in

496
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,349
different context but I don't really

497
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,399
name up names I don't want to leave

498
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,919
anybody I don't want to hurt any

499
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,600
feelings but if there's a lot of amazing

500
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,279
breeders and there's a lot of passionate

501
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,500
breeders with good hearts and those the

502
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,730
people I'd like to work with yeah

503
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,769
fantastic inside a quest

504
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,809
we've got from a lot of people was are

505
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,519
you able to kind of explain the

506
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,839
differences between your seed companies

507
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,579
a lot of people are aware there's a few

508
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,099
of them now something I personally was

509
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,990
interested in is what is the distinction

510
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,669
you know is do you look at a project and

511
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,710
you think oh this is a super natural

512
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,660
selections project or you know it is

513
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,220
there kind of rules and then that you

514
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,310
know dictates what each project falls

515
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,440
into or is it a bit more loose than that

516
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,240
kind of it's almost like a like a artist

517
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,440
that has a couple bands you know and

518
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,970
they're like free to do whatever they

519
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,549
want within the context and bands I

520
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,049
don't get tides you know like you don't

521
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:29,819
want to do this on this band you're

522
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,859
gonna do that so I would say so

523
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,799
bori seeds is kind of the original and

524
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:37,919
that's kind of like I can do it's all

525
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,349
about doing whatever I want I can I can

526
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,420
mash up hybrids I can do Italy crosses I

527
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,519
can weave things and this it's kind of

528
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,259
like just really freedom it's but it's

529
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,579
also the one that pays the bills and

530
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,259
it's the one where I kind of have to

531
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,359
cater to the flavor of the weeks and

532
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,450
kind of add my own twist to some of the

533
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,849
modern elite hybrids or make unique cool

534
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:00,620
things and it's just kind of like it's

535
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:03,509
this the basic creative model and then

536
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:05,429
Marika is kind enough that's more the

537
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,009
preservation angle and that's would be

538
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:11,310
like working with heirloom and landrace

539
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:13,049
and sometimes mostly those may be

540
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:15,179
vintage but not so much but mostly just

541
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,460
heirloom landrace preservation and that

542
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,980
kind of anything I collect when I travel

543
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,710
anything I get from other people with

544
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,079
good graces I also all that money that

545
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:28,650
is generated from Eureka goes to

546
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:30,210
scholarships and to funds to keep on

547
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,820
going and keep on collecting so it's

548
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,769
kind of just a preservation seed company

549
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,509
and you know there's a couple releases

550
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,639
each year and what I think is kind of

551
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:40,619
fun or fun to work out and what I think

552
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,390
people would enjoy working away hour

553
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:44,609
just having their bank or their

554
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,410
collection and that's kind of that and

555
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:48,149
then supernatural selections is new and

556
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,640
that's kind of like that's really what

557
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,590
I'm really excited about because it's

558
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,990
it's going back to the roots of things

559
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:56,699
it's all there's no modern hybrids I

560
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:01,650
mean it's using no modern lines so it's

561
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:03,539
all landrace vintage or heirloom and so

562
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:05,430
I get in there all f1 hybrids using

563
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,589
these old things so I get to go back and

564
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,659
I can create so many

565
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:12,569
unique things I'm not stuck in that kind

566
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:13,590
of the stagnant hyperbole gene pool that

567
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:16,589
we have right now where everything's

568
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:19,139
kind of mashed up kind of like fasting

569
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:20,819
around 31 flavors style which is awesome

570
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,110
there's so much unique stuff to pop out

571
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,720
of that but this really gives me a

572
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:27,389
chance to kind of blaze my own Trail and

573
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,339
go back to the countries that I've

574
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,679
always loved and the places and you know

575
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:33,959
because all these seed lines especially

576
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,080
the vintage in the land race they all

577
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,509
have their own special spirit and soul

578
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:41,069
and effect in flavors and by combining

579
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:42,898
these it's like it's it's pretty amazing

580
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:45,720
like you kick your Congolese and then

581
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:47,369
and like a Kashmiri like so you're

582
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,669
taking these beautiful Himalayan

583
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:54,359
planting and merging them with these you

584
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:55,919
know deep humid tropical jungle strains

585
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,509
and you're getting these extreme

586
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,788
possibilities and from there you can

587
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:01,230
really go all over the place and I think

588
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:03,269
it's I don't know it just for me it

589
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,159
feels like instead of kind of like

590
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:10,440
deejaying it feels like producing music

591
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:12,750
arts I don't know and then hope I'm not

592
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,419
around with too much and then the final

593
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:18,869
one was you sooner and sooner Gina's

594
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,429
just me wanting to have fun connecting

595
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:22,319
with people in a way also give back to

596
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:24,840
the community but I'm so busy it's

597
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,189
really hard to kind of get that started

598
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,259
and I have you know I have a few people

599
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,880
I've been talking to and and I think

600
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:32,669
it'll happen eventually it's just I'm

601
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,669
just so so busy doing my own stuff I

602
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,020
kind of wish you know it's almost I kind

603
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:38,700
of want to scale down and be able to

604
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,519
enjoy life a little more I feel like I'm

605
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,250
just never-ending Lee grinding away but

606
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,990
it's I mean that's my service so I feel

607
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,579
good about it it's my way that I can

608
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,149
kind of nourish the community is by

609
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:54,599
creating and by doing that so it feels

610
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:57,028
good now you never consider kind of

611
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,288
expanding the team Boddie so to speak

612
00:23:57,028 --> 00:24:00,630
such that maybe you did have more

613
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:02,669
freedom to you know for example go

614
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,399
pursue landrace seeds or things like

615
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:07,259
that or are you is is part of it being a

616
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:10,288
small kind of mom-and-pop business part

617
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:11,730
of the central theme of it all I mean it

618
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:13,589
is I know I don't think I'm like a

619
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,870
control freak but I really like to make

620
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:17,908
sure that my hands are in every single

621
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:19,229
process and I think that's how we keep I

622
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:20,700
don't know if that's how we keep the

623
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,750
prices down or I mean that doesn't make

624
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,788
sense but um

625
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,950
it allows me to stay connected to

626
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:27,599
whatever I produce and you know I would

627
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,759
love at some point maybe when the laws

628
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,740
are more solidified and things change it

629
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,659
would be nice if some someone could take

630
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,000
care of my mom room I can keep it a lot

631
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,309
healthier than I can or so I can travel

632
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,200
and I can do it and there's a lot of a

633
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:42,720
lot of my friends or getting in reading

634
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,500
and they're doing amazing jobs I would

635
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,079
love to kind of branch out but yeah at

636
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,190
this point I'm just I'm kind of so in my

637
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:55,378
flow that I almost don't want to kind of

638
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,820
move out in any way so it's more to see

639
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:58,558
what the futures gonna bring if it

640
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:00,689
brings us you know this brave new world

641
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,128
of cannabis I would love to kind of free

642
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,370
it up I would even love to do like an

643
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:06,869
Anthony Bourdain travel cannabis show

644
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:08,638
kind of like strain hunters but Cheech

645
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:10,678
and Chong meets kind of Austin Powers

646
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:12,240
style okay

647
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,419
so that's actually one of the questions

648
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,620
I had was um would you ever consider

649
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:18,990
documenting your landrace adventures

650
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,719
because I mean the viewership is there

651
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,490
and you know I'm sure everyone would

652
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,409
argue that you could do a better job

653
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,919
than what strain hunters did in almost

654
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:32,070
every respect um you know the funny

655
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,169
thing is if on breed Bay and I think I

656
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:35,970
see Megan if you dig there are you stay

657
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:39,570
when I had more time I used to do these

658
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:41,038
big elaborate kind of travel logs with

659
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:42,298
all the pictures and I write about all

660
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,798
the things so they're out there if you

661
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:45,210
search for him I think there's like five

662
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:46,769
or six listening on breed Bay but

663
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,298
they're on some other ones and I would

664
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:49,980
love you there's so many countries that

665
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,168
I kind of flail and I haven't done yet

666
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,339
but I just don't have time to like at

667
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:54,750
the end of the day I'm kind of burnt or

668
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:57,628
I don't want to just want to listen to

669
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,819
music or smoke and just meditate or

670
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:03,839
think or you know I don't that's writing

671
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:05,609
it was hard and I loved it but yeah I

672
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,439
would love to I would love to go out and

673
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:10,500
do that I mean I I don't think I would

674
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,269
be as daring as going into the Congo and

675
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,519
places like that but I would definitely

676
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:16,440
like to go to places like you know I

677
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,909
would go to the Ewok village if I could

678
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,399
if I was spaceship I know they're

679
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,860
smoking something ordinary I would love

680
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,089
to go to the places where people are you

681
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:25,829
know kind of the same places I've been

682
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,509
like mountain people people that have

683
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:30,118
that deep connection with nature and to

684
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:33,808
the heart and do more shows and kind of

685
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:35,429
I don't know there's this one guy that

686
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:37,259
this show called going tribal

687
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,549
I think that's what it's called but it

688
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:39,960
is the most unique show cuz he was an

689
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,058
anthropologist and he would they would

690
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,289
send him to all these really cool tribes

691
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,759
out in the middle of nowhere and they

692
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,649
would just show him

693
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,779
connecting with them and and like

694
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,850
laughing and caring and sharing food and

695
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,680
that's kind of what I like to do but ya

696
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:56,069
what throw in the cannabis - that would

697
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:59,490
be amazing so but so get to down the

698
00:26:56,069 --> 00:27:01,379
rabbit hole of Landry's hunting cos got

699
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,269
a whole whole bunch of questions on that

700
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,860
I just wanted to bring it back to a kind

701
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:07,950
of an idea you mentioned earlier in that

702
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:12,389
in regards to supernatural selections do

703
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:14,370
you feel that doing these kind of raw f1

704
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,280
landrace hybrids is gonna potentially

705
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:18,569
lead to the next skunk or the next

706
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,259
Northern Lights and that could

707
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:23,399
potentially be what kind of injects that

708
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:25,079
invigorated energy into the community or

709
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,910
do you think maybe a won't pan out like

710
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:30,089
that because that was more a consequence

711
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,710
of the time you know the lack of

712
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:35,549
genetics and that was maybe why those

713
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:37,799
strands got so big I don't know those

714
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:40,649
kind of particular strains were really

715
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,720
strains that were braided over seasons

716
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,540
you know each year they would add in and

717
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,460
new since it was pre kind of clone grow

718
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,500
I grew out the plants they found in the

719
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,410
bag seed from Mexico Thailand Colombia

720
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,390
pick your favorites keep the seeds next

721
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,830
year braided into the next favorite one

722
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,840
and these were these elaborate kind of

723
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:59,099
breeding programs through time and I

724
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,549
think those produce some of those really

725
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:05,759
amazing ones like skunks and haze but my

726
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:09,659
goal with Supernatural selections is to

727
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,980
really allow people to I don't know to

728
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,570
see the extreme possibilities of

729
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,160
cannabis has to offer to really see

730
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,139
where we can take it where we can go and

731
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,750
how things combine and then the

732
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,450
beautiful part about it is you can f/2

733
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,759
that thing and it opens up an amazing

734
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,170
treasure chest of those two lines and if

735
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,849
those lines are vintage lines they're

736
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,308
like little time machines and it takes

737
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:31,139
you back to those simpler times when

738
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:33,779
that plant and even its geography all

739
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:39,240
the information held in that and it's

740
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:41,910
like I always say that right now I'm

741
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,130
drawing planes but I think it's just my

742
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,570
way of getting to like mine kind of

743
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,480
graduating getting to the next level of

744
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:48,750
being even more creative at the plant

745
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,230
yes

746
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,460
if to myself of saying okay you've got

747
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,769
to a certain point where you have a

748
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,960
basic understanding of cannabis and

749
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,369
plants and breeding or what there's

750
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,630
stuff like that and now this is

751
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,369
something that you can embark on now

752
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,600
that's even more of a challenge but

753
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:08,459
offers so much more treasure okay so

754
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:10,558
that brings up this kind of idea which

755
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,069
is quite prevalent at the moment the

756
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,629
idea of as I say the concept of getting

757
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:17,099
permission to breed with other people's

758
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,960
genetics or just in general breeding

759
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,119
with other people's genetics a lot of

760
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,298
people are having kinda you know the

761
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,000
debate is is buying someone seeds enough

762
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,740
for you to then breed with them or do

763
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,109
you think it's you know kind of good

764
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,909
practice to first go ask the breeder if

765
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:36,178
it's alright to do so first where do you

766
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:37,500
sit on this issue well you know I

767
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,659
understand it coming from all different

768
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,159
angles I'm pretty open I feel really

769
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,510
honored when people breed with my stuff

770
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,250
and I don't have an issue

771
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:45,839
I understand people but you know I don't

772
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,788
put a lot of time and work into some of

773
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,490
their line working and stuff and they

774
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:52,408
want to keep it proprietary but what I

775
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,558
think really the basis of it is is

776
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:56,700
communication I think I think if you're

777
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:58,740
gonna breed with someone else's work

778
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,000
what an amazing time to be able to

779
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,009
connect with that person like to send

780
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,288
them an email go hey I really enjoy this

781
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:07,259
I really want to breed with it you know

782
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:09,658
and make that connection maybe it's a

783
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:12,690
friendship maybe you know I think with

784
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,640
just the basic respect in communication

785
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,890
it opens up like a whole new world and I

786
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,600
think it can really heal the whole

787
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,710
cannabis breeding community because

788
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,750
there's so much bickering and fighting

789
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,000
and weird everybody doing kooky stuff

790
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,890
then I think if people just communicate

791
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,259
it and even if someone says no you don't

792
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,788
have I mean it's really up to you I'm

793
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,700
sure you can still make the cross maybe

794
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:35,308
you it'll be kind of taboo but I think

795
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,259
most people are human and you ask them

796
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:40,109
and and you explain what you want to do

797
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:43,019
I think it should be fine I mean I don't

798
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:45,329
think it's cool to 2f2 people's work and

799
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:47,639
then sell it unless you ask your more if

800
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:49,199
it's a deadline maybe it's no longer

801
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,809
being produced or the breeders no longer

802
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,700
around that's fine but really I think

803
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:56,339
it's an opportunity for communication

804
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,259
that we don't really have you know so

805
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:59,609
it's interesting that you mentioned the

806
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,200
idea and I feel it's true there's a

807
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,869
sentiment within the community right now

808
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,120
that

809
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:06,129
the level of camaraderie and friendship

810
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:08,409
is kind of declining compared to in

811
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,630
previous generations do you kind of

812
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,160
agree with that and more so how do you

813
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,300
think we deal with that if that is the

814
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,490
case you know I definitely see that it's

815
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:21,669
kind of you know and it's also - its

816
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:24,460
kind of in flux there's a lot of people

817
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,560
that are being attracted to this because

818
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:33,670
it is so it's such a magnificent thing

819
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:36,069
and you know know it's kind of hard to

820
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,590
weigh in on for me I think a lot of

821
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:40,599
problems now as with social media I

822
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:42,039
think before in the early times there

823
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,240
was a lot less people so there's a lot

824
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:45,250
more communication there's a lot more

825
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,690
camaraderie it wasn't as commercial

826
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,299
people weren't producing seeds and there

827
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,549
wasn't so many elite clones the forum's

828
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:53,529
were about information and people

829
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:55,329
connecting and they went over time you

830
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:57,700
know like Instagram is an amazing thing

831
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:59,889
it's very visual it's mr. oral it's all

832
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,289
it's good for a TD people but it doesn't

833
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:04,900
really foster community because it's

834
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:06,819
just basically for promotion it seems

835
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,040
you post up a picture people get to

836
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:10,659
write a couple things and then it's on

837
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,670
to the next thing it's not like a thread

838
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,920
in a forum where people over the years

839
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:18,460
or adding to it and you know what I mean

840
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,920
it's so quick and and so glossy and

841
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:24,569
in-your-face and neon that you don't

842
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,400
there's not a way to really make that

843
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:31,419
enduring in a way and I think it causes

844
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,790
a lot of problems because people can be

845
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:37,930
very short very quick very disrespectful

846
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:38,529
very I think it just it really doesn't

847
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,210
bring out

848
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,649
I mean sure they're people that do

849
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,759
amazing things on it but it doesn't seem

850
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:49,030
to be the best angle for fostering a

851
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,400
community do you think that the best way

852
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:53,799
for maybe a newly emerging breeder or

853
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,990
someone with maybe not quite as big of a

854
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,579
reputation as they deserve do you think

855
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:01,720
the best way for them to get known is to

856
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:03,789
not kind of partake in that marketing

857
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,769
game so to speak the invention but kind

858
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:07,599
of let their work speak for itself or do

859
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:10,809
you feel that maybe we're in an age

860
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,409
where you almost can't be off Instagram

861
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:13,940
you know that you need that

862
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,640
getting a SPECT otherwise he's never

863
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,080
gonna take off yeah I mean four new

864
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,910
breeders I think Instagram is pretty

865
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,799
crucial in a way because it's kind of

866
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,509
like the roster it's like you sign up

867
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:31,909
like hey this is me this is what I'm

868
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:34,400
doing it's a tough one I think for what

869
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,500
I four new breeders you know I say make

870
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,410
a good cross and give away a bazillion

871
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,950
seeds just give away seeds and make

872
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,840
friends and communicate and let your

873
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,400
seeds be talked for you after people you

874
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,839
know where the mouth is the ultimate

875
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,360
thing that's why I don't I don't ever

876
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,099
I'd never advertise I never promote

877
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,289
myself because I believe that I'm

878
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:55,609
promoting myself through my work and if

879
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:57,079
people like to work they're gonna tell

880
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:59,779
their friends they're gonna do more it's

881
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,879
like I think just if you're into it do

882
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:04,129
it do it for the plants sake do it for

883
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,540
your community make them awesome hybrid

884
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,240
give out all the seeds and see where

885
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:10,369
that takes you yeah that sounds like

886
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,649
some great advice so if we go back to

887
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,940
kind of the breeding side of things when

888
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,950
you are thinking about doing a new

889
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,900
project maybe a line or just a certain

890
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:19,789
cross do you approach it in a very

891
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,500
conceptualized manner like do you think

892
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:22,940
I want to pair this male with this

893
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,280
female and I think that'll work out

894
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,409
quite well or is it more so just a

895
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,850
general process where you're thinking oh

896
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,629
let's see what happens you know like

897
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:34,880
this could be interesting yeah well for

898
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,809
me I kind of have a lot of different

899
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,340
approaches

900
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:39,259
sometimes I'll breed like I'm

901
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,570
emotionally where I just kind of feel

902
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,429
like this plant and this plant need to

903
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,830
be together like they just kind of feel

904
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,240
like they have similarities and

905
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:49,009
dissimilarities that would work perfect

906
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,149
together and I just kind of want to you

907
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,770
know it's almost like you're the

908
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,179
matchmaker or it's like the dating game

909
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:54,650
or something and you know especially

910
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,880
when you know your plants and you've

911
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,849
been around them and you have a nice mom

912
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,530
room you can kind of there's the plants

913
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:03,110
have their own interactions you can kind

914
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,210
of say like hey this plant kind of seems

915
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:07,579
like it kind of likes this plant you

916
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,829
know and bring them together or you know

917
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:11,809
it's always fun to put twists on some of

918
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:13,460
the new elite hybrids or add some

919
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:15,710
special thing to the chem line I mean

920
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,300
you know additive and subtractive you

921
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,599
know goals are great if you have a goal

922
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,460
like you want to make but some plant

923
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,650
that has a specific terpene signature

924
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,240
you can really you know you want all

925
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,789
your your goal orange I believe to

926
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:31,399
it's all kind of like for me I try and

927
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:33,050
kind of just keep myself open to the

928
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,940
extreme possibilities and just kind of

929
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,500
feel out what's going on and for

930
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,760
breeding if I'm you know for my

931
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,409
commercial breeding where I'm kind of

932
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,230
generating enough money to keep my

933
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:44,659
family and I said is I usually develop

934
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:47,750
males you know special males and then I

935
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:51,049
will pollinate basically my whole harem

936
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:54,108
and then slowly test those over time and

937
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:56,000
see where those go and and continually

938
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:58,039
each year you know finding more unique

939
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,809
males and kind of seeing how they do and

940
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,789
I'll use like a target female that I

941
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:03,949
know how she expresses so when I took a

942
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:05,719
new male it's usually hit to her first

943
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:08,899
so I can see kind of what she does with

944
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:10,969
this new male and then I you know for me

945
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,559
I guess for basically for Bodi seeds

946
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,868
it's all about developing special males

947
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,400
and then using them on kind of my own

948
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:19,460
special plants and then the flavors of

949
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,349
the week so I mean that's kind of the

950
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,088
gist I mean there's different breeding

951
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:25,490
styles we could get into that of tricks

952
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:27,199
and stuff but really it's just kind of

953
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:31,819
following your bliss being passionate

954
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:33,679
about it and you know okay okay and so

955
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,170
if you decided you wanted to take a

956
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,608
certain strain to the next generation or

957
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,039
you want to you know look for a special

958
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:41,929
male to work with how many seeds do

959
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,719
ideally like to pop to kind of get a

960
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:46,250
good representation of the strain to you

961
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:49,759
know be able to see what's locked within

962
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,349
it from my seeds I'll usually just pop

963
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,050
one pack and if I don't find something

964
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:55,430
in a pack then I call it a bummer thing

965
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,680
I think you should be able to find an

966
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:59,358
excellent plant in every pack that's

967
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,098
what most a year should be should be

968
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,289
aiming for at least yeah vegans get

969
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:05,838
multiple packs research and you know

970
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:08,059
these days it's not hard to make a good

971
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,250
hybrid our gene pool has been so refined

972
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,599
over time you know it's not like going

973
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,829
back to the 70s and 80s where you're

974
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,570
bringing these land races together it's

975
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,179
like we have a highly refined gene pool

976
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,260
and it's almost impossible to make a bad

977
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:20,569
cross with some of the stuff we have

978
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,430
today unless you know except you know it

979
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,230
may be from a frenetic tendencies and

980
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:26,269
stuff that kind of have been slowly

981
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,130
creeping in it's not it's not rocket

982
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:29,838
scientist and if you're passionate it's

983
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,369
pretty easy just to put things together

984
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,440
and get good things out but if you have

985
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:35,119
a vision you're really gonna want to do

986
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,039
some goal or into a reading where you're

987
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,380
really kind of focusing on an outcome

988
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,619
and doing everything you can to

989
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,930
fill that okay and so do you find that's

990
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:47,119
the case with most of your projects like

991
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:49,338
I think the the analogy that jumps to

992
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,829
mind is I think sub cool said that in

993
00:37:49,338 --> 00:37:53,239
his mind when he's breeding to create a

994
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:54,349
certain flavor it's kind of like cooking

995
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,969
you know you're kind of thinking what

996
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:57,980
two flavors would add together to make

997
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:59,449
that strain is that kind of similar to

998
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,719
how you think when you're thinking about

999
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:04,719
those crosses yeah I mean if I'm being

1000
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,159
specifically for terpenes and flavor

1001
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,798
usually that'll be my primary thing as

1002
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:11,538
all is I'll find two plants in the theme

1003
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:13,909
you know that I know have either

1004
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,619
complementary or similar smells that I

1005
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:19,219
think could either bolster them or

1006
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:20,420
increase it and you know for aroma based

1007
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:22,009
breeding it's probably one of the

1008
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,659
besides color based breeding it's

1009
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:26,809
probably the easiest reading you know

1010
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:29,719
you can basically take your males flower

1011
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:31,130
them super long until they put out

1012
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:33,018
visible resin and you can smell the

1013
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,838
resin and then you basically can choose

1014
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:37,159
which one is the one that smells closest

1015
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,250
to what you want with the best structure

1016
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,379
and if you can't wait you can use ethyl

1017
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,420
on what is that stuff called um there's

1018
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:50,150
a nano name for it but basically it

1019
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:52,009
turns your males to females yeah you can

1020
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,500
and you can you know smelled a lot

1021
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:56,000
quicker but I don't really think that's

1022
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,190
a great way because then you can't find

1023
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,599
resinous males and I'm really into

1024
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,179
resinous males I know some people aren't

1025
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,240
but I think resinous males for me is

1026
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:06,639
really what I kind of aim for what I'm

1027
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:11,719
looking for

1028
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:14,058
aroma based breeding okay what do you

1029
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,949
think is the most well known bode

1030
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:19,160
strains so to speak what what strain

1031
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:21,409
embodies bode seeds the best in your

1032
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:22,879
opinion I don't know you know the two

1033
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:25,639
ones that people always say my like

1034
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,130
flagships are go gog and sunshine

1035
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:31,129
daydream kind of using those two males

1036
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:33,380
if I used a lot there now kind of

1037
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,500
retired those I guess would be my my

1038
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,180
current legacy in a way I was I was

1039
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,338
gonna mention those two but I thought if

1040
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:45,980
I if I suggested them it might bait you

1041
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:47,599
into picking them so the tranquil if an

1042
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,769
tiser is a line that's always been of

1043
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,150
interest to me I mean I've personally

1044
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:52,729
played around breeding with it myself

1045
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,139
but the the aspect which I find most

1046
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,760
interest

1047
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:57,190
it is how many times it's been you know

1048
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,260
remixed and reworked what was it about

1049
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:02,679
that cross which made you go back to it

1050
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:05,500
so many times it was just kind of like a

1051
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,509
fun and fascinating thing to kind of

1052
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,548
play with it you know I'm really in with

1053
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:13,319
I'm really into music I'm really into

1054
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:15,788
like DOM and the remix and the E and

1055
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:17,380
taking things and you know moving him

1056
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:19,510
back and forth and I love flipping

1057
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,579
parents and it just seemed it was a

1058
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,440
unique line and I had you know some

1059
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:25,480
really fun things and so each time I

1060
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,760
would kind of tinker with the parent

1061
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,960
lines I'd be like okay so I'm you know

1062
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,269
moving it forward a generation or

1063
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,798
backwards or using male/female reversals

1064
00:40:31,268 --> 00:40:34,899
like let's see what this does you know

1065
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:38,259
this is like another kind of facet of

1066
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,059
the tranquil elephant Iser so for me it

1067
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,640
was just having fun and kind of

1068
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:47,048
exploring bouncing back and forth and

1069
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:49,719
and you know and even I don't know I

1070
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:52,179
mean it was mostly just for the

1071
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,328
experience of just exploring that way of

1072
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:57,578
working with the plants you did it with

1073
00:40:55,329 --> 00:41:00,818
the mother's milk as well did you find

1074
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:01,960
the results were as good or young and

1075
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:03,759
you know as a result of that is it

1076
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,199
something you would consider doing again

1077
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:09,670
in the future or is it more of a

1078
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:11,439
case-by-case basis well I I can't make

1079
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:14,400
this anymore I mean I can line breed

1080
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,259
them but I retired both of those males

1081
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,019
so I mean in the future I love you know

1082
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:21,699
I might I'm thinking about kind of doing

1083
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:24,308
fun things with the goji now that it you

1084
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:27,250
know that it's gone maybe line reading

1085
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:29,500
it or taking my favorite fee knows and

1086
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:33,730
kind of playing off those or even you

1087
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,139
know making remixes in a way but for me

1088
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,519
I'm always trying to move forward I

1089
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:38,828
don't like to stay static I don't like

1090
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:40,629
to be stuck in in in lines I like to

1091
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,190
kind of always be exploring and moving

1092
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,470
forward and kind of following my passion

1093
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,798
and if I get stuck in things like you

1094
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,568
know

1095
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:47,949
static lines it's like in the UK they

1096
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:49,808
always get mad because they say oh you

1097
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:51,009
know you never restock your whole mind

1098
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:52,869
you're always creating new ones and I'm

1099
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,608
like yeah I don't want to just be

1100
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:56,410
creating those same old lines over and

1101
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:59,018
over I'm sure they're great and you know

1102
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:01,298
it also gives people the ability you

1103
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:03,159
know goji's no longer sunshine dude you

1104
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:04,509
have to go longer so people can F to

1105
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:06,489
those they can play with them they can

1106
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:07,990
do their own twist on them I think it

1107
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:09,939
you know it's beautiful to pass the

1108
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:12,309
torch and allow people to bring their

1109
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,950
own special artistry to it too so I you

1110
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:16,599
know I think moving forward is a is a

1111
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,519
really good thing and I think remix

1112
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,319
seeing and playing around and moving

1113
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,269
things back and forth and males and

1114
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,220
females moving their positions I think

1115
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:28,300
is a really unique way to kind of really

1116
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:30,879
see the deeper side of a string and so

1117
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:34,000
the ancient OG that's another one which

1118
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,550
has a bit of a cult following my feeling

1119
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,550
is probably due to the Iranian genetics

1120
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,690
in it I've seen a quote on mine it was

1121
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,710
on a form I think it might even been

1122
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,200
from your post and it said something

1123
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:46,000
along the lines of the Iranian might not

1124
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:48,489
be an Iranian landrace but just

1125
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,380
something along those lines this brings

1126
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:51,939
up the idea for me of how do you know

1127
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,530
what's real especially someone in your

1128
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,210
position who must be offered a lot of

1129
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,300
things and most of the time you're

1130
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:59,889
probably unable to verify it for sure

1131
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,600
maybe using the Iranian as an example

1132
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:03,759
you know like how do you go about trying

1133
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,610
to verify or what's your process in that

1134
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,880
regard well I mean these days I try and

1135
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:11,320
I think basics popping your own seeds

1136
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,358
you know exactly where it came from I

1137
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,160
think that's the best way to to make

1138
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,889
sure something is verified

1139
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:20,679
I tried pretty pretty good I used to be

1140
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:22,900
even more better at really make tracing

1141
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,429
the pathway of a clone who I got it from

1142
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:28,030
who they got it from and really making

1143
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:29,919
sure I know the origin stories and stuff

1144
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:32,710
and a few times I get myself into

1145
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,680
trouble you know like I think in the kim

1146
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,710
91 a long long time ago there was only

1147
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:41,139
one kim 91 clone and it and and it was a

1148
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,900
verified by kim dog and this and that

1149
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:46,509
and it came from jo brands kind of camp

1150
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:50,858
and then later it came out that really

1151
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:53,140
wasn't the kim 91 it was like a

1152
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:54,489
divergent line or an alternate line and

1153
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:56,199
you know the the real community was the

1154
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:58,689
stunt VA and when I got that I was like

1155
00:43:56,199 --> 00:44:00,669
okay now I see so I had the kim 91 jb

1156
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:02,858
and kim know anyone's don't be a and

1157
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:06,519
they're both amazing plants but by you

1158
00:44:02,858 --> 00:44:08,559
know talking to people and and really

1159
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,329
you know I respect a lot of people who

1160
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,369
do a lot of the strain research and

1161
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,750
really listening to them I'm like okay

1162
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,119
yeah we're right so I had to make a

1163
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,889
disclaimer and all that and then with

1164
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,869
Iranian you know that was a unique

1165
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:22,449
situation I got a couple clone

1166
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:24,309
from a friend who had a really unique

1167
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:26,489
connection offline connection it was an

1168
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:30,430
old Persian man and he had some really

1169
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:32,229
cool old kind of like la stuff like he

1170
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:33,940
had the LA pure curse she had the LA

1171
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,498
Street Gani which it was like a plant

1172
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,960
that was back before the og that was

1173
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:40,689
pretty popular what else he had he had

1174
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,568
that Iranian and then something else and

1175
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,940
so he had so many unique and rare lines

1176
00:44:43,568 --> 00:44:50,768
I kind of bought into that yeah this may

1177
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:53,048
be this is the progeny of maybe you know

1178
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:54,518
Persian strains could be the og crush

1179
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:56,219
maybe this Israel does have a lot of

1180
00:44:54,518 --> 00:44:58,868
similarities but you know I don't know

1181
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:01,328
if it was a missed mark or something I

1182
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:04,390
almost think it could have been like

1183
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:05,079
maybe like one of the more primordial oh

1184
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:07,058
geez

1185
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,940
just the way it was it was so close to

1186
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:11,710
energy it was a little bit more wild but

1187
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,659
it sure does make good crosses and it

1188
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,579
makes great outdoor crosses I can almost

1189
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:17,528
see it having the vigor and the kind of

1190
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:19,180
stability of a Landry so I know that's a

1191
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:21,639
tricky one that died kind of adds the

1192
00:45:19,179 --> 00:45:23,169
mystique and I kind of like that people

1193
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:24,730
are really loving that line because it

1194
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,588
does so well outdoors and I really like

1195
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:28,088
that people are doing f2s and are really

1196
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:31,239
kind of they're kind of taking the ball

1197
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:33,009
and running and I mean try an F to it or

1198
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:34,989
f3 and kind of explore - but I'm just

1199
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:37,059
stoked to watch other people but it's

1200
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:39,519
such a cool line and so you know it's

1201
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:42,278
that's one of my anomalies there's only

1202
00:45:39,518 --> 00:45:43,988
a few but that's definitely one of them

1203
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:45,699
and all I can really say about it is

1204
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:49,239
it's Bruce Lee but it's amazing line I

1205
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:50,858
don't I can't verify that particular one

1206
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:55,298
because I wouldn't no longer in contact

1207
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:56,619
with that person yeah okay that raises

1208
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:58,838
an interesting question what do you

1209
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:00,910
think are the origins of the og I mean

1210
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:02,259
we've heard a lot of people who I

1211
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:05,828
personally have heard a lot of people

1212
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:08,318
say that it's TK and then possibly cross

1213
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:10,150
211 tie or possibly just s ones you know

1214
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,489
like and then the oh geez so to speak

1215
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,130
went from there what's your opinion on

1216
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:16,960
this I mean that's a good question

1217
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,579
there's so many different people saying

1218
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,759
that you know I've heard everything from

1219
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:25,630
it's an old Kauai strain it's a or there

1220
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:27,190
was you know what Kahlua cater Missy's

1221
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,710
name he was singing you know was an

1222
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:32,909
old-world Pakistani lemon tie and then

1223
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:35,309
there's the whatever is the soup or not

1224
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:36,719
in Florida and you know all these people

1225
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:38,160
tracing it back and I think that's all

1226
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,949
great Oh Reese tracing it back but for

1227
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,239
me I don't really even care where it

1228
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:44,159
came from I want to know what it's made

1229
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,199
of I want to know go back before that

1230
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,078
like what is it what is its actual

1231
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,728
genetics is it some old Dutch stock that

1232
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,289
somebody found our old super sativa Club

1233
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:54,989
or was it a combination of something

1234
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:57,989
special like a Pakistani Mexican or

1235
00:46:54,989 --> 00:47:00,478
maybe even a Thai Mexican or some kind

1236
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:02,429
of all right you know a lot of more

1237
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:03,149
Central Asian strains when people say

1238
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:05,578
cush

1239
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:09,619
you know the whole cush moniker it's

1240
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,619
basically that kind of spicy powdery

1241
00:47:09,858 --> 00:47:14,400
coffee baby powder kind of smell that

1242
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,099
people associate with a lot of the

1243
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,440
California and LA strains I've never

1244
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:20,910
experienced a plant from the Hindu Kush

1245
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,499
region that smells anything or looks

1246
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:23,818
anything like that maybe looks like if I

1247
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:25,348
never smell like it but you know where

1248
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:28,228
those plants that smell like that come

1249
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:31,349
from is Iran Iraq all of Central Asia

1250
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:33,268
has those very perfumey spicy with those

1251
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,759
same kind of things I really think that

1252
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:39,179
it must have been a Central Asian and

1253
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:42,869
then some kind of very terpene rich

1254
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:45,149
lemony-lemon Leone maybe a Mexican old

1255
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:47,400
Mexican maybe it's high but you know

1256
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:49,318
that could that could play into why it's

1257
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,059
very hermaphroditic in certain ways you

1258
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:52,288
know I don't think anybody will ever

1259
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,569
know I would love to see that

1260
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:55,559
I remember that the Adam Dunn show where

1261
00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:57,420
they were doing that whole genome

1262
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:01,200
testing and I love to see FiOS maybe go

1263
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,639
deeper and see kind of where you know

1264
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,228
through genetics where it might be it's

1265
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,328
it's a unique strain and it's so amazing

1266
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:10,618
so beautiful but no one seems to know

1267
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:13,170
the exact origins yeah in regards to

1268
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:15,298
that Jay became 91 you at you answered

1269
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:17,159
about three of my questions so I'm gonna

1270
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:20,400
I'm gonna try to amalgamate that's left

1271
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:23,670
as I'm into one so in regards to the JB

1272
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,039
you know chem 91 what what about it

1273
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,690
makes it worth breeding with because you

1274
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,630
do still breed with it you just label it

1275
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,249
you know the JB chem 91 so you know like

1276
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:34,469
what's what's different because in my

1277
00:48:32,248 --> 00:48:36,899
mind I thought we'll is it different

1278
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:38,670
enough such that it's worth breeding

1279
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,710
with or is it kind of just like a bit of

1280
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:44,548
an imitation that's not quite as good as

1281
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:46,829
the original you know I think it's

1282
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:49,588
pretty cool it's definitely not

1283
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:51,359
so if you know the skunk VA is kind of

1284
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:56,548
almost a genius and it's kind of like a

1285
00:48:51,358 --> 00:49:00,058
dark Afghani OG like it rich and oily

1286
00:48:56,548 --> 00:49:02,009
and and spicy and then the chem 91 JB is

1287
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,359
this really unique it has a really

1288
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:05,489
unique look it's got that really kind of

1289
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:08,759
old-school kind of almost like hash

1290
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:12,059
planting nodules but it has a very kind

1291
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:14,579
of like diesel e and then kind of earthy

1292
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:16,798
and almost skunky it's a lot more kind

1293
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,559
of decently earthy skunky than the stunt

1294
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:21,688
VA which is kind of that more dark deep

1295
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,548
Oh G thing so I definitely think it

1296
00:49:21,688 --> 00:49:25,139
hasn't it kind of has like it reminds me

1297
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:26,579
of kind of like when people when I was

1298
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:28,348
in high school when people come up like

1299
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:31,229
with the super tank bud you know the

1300
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:34,079
skunk it kind of reminds me of that it's

1301
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:36,568
just knobby and I think it's great plant

1302
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,028
I mean sometimes it's not the most

1303
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:40,619
stable in crosses but I think it has its

1304
00:49:39,028 --> 00:49:42,869
place and who knows what it is it'd be

1305
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:44,729
unique to get Joe brand to kind of talk

1306
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:46,289
about some of these kind of cuts that

1307
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:47,879
kind of slipped out of his Arsenal and

1308
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:49,949
what they really were and no one seems

1309
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,318
to really know and now there's all kinds

1310
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:53,608
of you know there's still a lot of cumin

1311
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,318
anyone's out there there's like the big

1312
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:57,838
worm and there's a lot of different ones

1313
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:59,188
and who knows really where and what

1314
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:01,498
these are coming from and if they're

1315
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:05,149
just swans or if they're hybrids or

1316
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:08,818
maybe they yeah it's the whole string

1317
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:10,699
strain is inspector strain thing is

1318
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:13,679
pretty amazing when you get into it I

1319
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:15,509
mean the Kemper sign has got a lot of

1320
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,298
mystery surrounding in my opinion I love

1321
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:19,920
following the history on it what was

1322
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:21,748
that whole process like of you

1323
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,150
discovering that it wasn't the real chem

1324
00:50:21,748 --> 00:50:25,978
91 like how did that happen did someone

1325
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,599
come to you and say this is the real

1326
00:50:25,978 --> 00:50:28,828
chem 91 and then it was just kind of

1327
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,079
obvious or was it more of like a

1328
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:33,539
discovery thing yourself or how did that

1329
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,329
go down it was a combination of things

1330
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:38,278
it was you know a few people that really

1331
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:40,949
communicating with a few people that I

1332
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:43,588
really respect their knowledge about

1333
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:46,499
strains like I think my favorite people

1334
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:49,078
to ask about about California and like

1335
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:50,788
ma you know Oregon West Coast strains

1336
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,789
would be like inspector I think he has

1337
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:55,799
one of the most vast and underrated like

1338
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:58,949
strain mines on the planet like he is

1339
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:00,739
he's like a strain computer and he was

1340
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:03,150
you know we're friends and

1341
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:04,949
he showed me some of his pictures and he

1342
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,650
told me about his experiences and even

1343
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:10,219
at one point we traded and I got the cut

1344
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,660
I grew up side by side and then I saw

1345
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:14,039
what was it what does Louis country

1346
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:15,569
isn't he was a big dog I mean when he

1347
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:20,039
would never when he first came on line

1348
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:21,330
and I see Meg dog he posted these

1349
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:23,340
pictures and I'm like it looks similar

1350
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,960
but it's not the same and then you know

1351
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,880
really growing up side by side and then

1352
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,829
seeing and then I mean the whole thing

1353
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,050
was funny as it threw me off is you know

1354
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:33,210
I did everything in her power to verify

1355
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,400
it you know someone even got enough to

1356
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:37,409
Kim dog himself and he verified it as

1357
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,090
the Kim 91 so I was like oh that's

1358
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:40,949
probably as good as I can get and that's

1359
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:43,200
why it's got it so I kind of loved

1360
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:46,169
eating crow like going back on my words

1361
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:48,089
I think you know I think it it's good to

1362
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,680
kind of come before the community and go

1363
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:53,010
hey I messed up and it shows people that

1364
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:55,279
they can do that too and and so I don't

1365
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:57,690
know the Kim line has so many unique

1366
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,370
like it's almost like this planet

1367
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:02,400
shooting islands like satellites of

1368
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:05,969
different things so we normally they're

1369
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,410
all cool plants yeah sure and money pay

1370
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:09,409
buddy wanted to know do you still have

1371
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:12,989
the chem one or the chem - by any chance

1372
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:14,969
I've never had the - I have the one

1373
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:16,949
seems like a little it's a little dotted

1374
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:19,199
with me I'm trying to bring it back but

1375
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:21,029
that yeah that's an amazing plant I

1376
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,699
don't think that many people have

1377
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:25,350
experienced it and it it's kind of a it

1378
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:27,960
would be like the sativa of the bunch it

1379
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:31,110
goes a couple weeks longer it has more

1380
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,360
kind of cerebral kind of high it's not

1381
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:35,789
as you know kind of like Kim dog is very

1382
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,320
like up it kind of muscles you it's like

1383
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:39,029
putting on with those inflatable samurai

1384
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,000
suits when you go out to our Halloween

1385
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:43,950
party they kind of like you know it

1386
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,929
takes you down and it kind of it's like

1387
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:48,719
a big bear hug in it you know also it's

1388
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:50,489
very heavy whereas the the Kim one it

1389
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,730
has that same color it has the Kemp

1390
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:55,559
smell it's a little bit different but it

1391
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,760
definitely has more of a sativa in a

1392
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,469
really kind of sativa here I like

1393
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,120
because it has that still warm hug but

1394
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:01,829
it has it's it's got kind of that heavy

1395
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,769
indica thing where your mind just goes

1396
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:06,150
off into amazing realms so I think it's

1397
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:08,009
a plan it's not I don't think it's

1398
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,550
commercially viable so much and it does

1399
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,250
take a while

1400
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:14,080
but it's a really unique kind of lens on

1401
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:17,139
the whole Kim family

1402
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,090
so do you find the refer more indica or

1403
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:21,069
more sativa strains for example or you

1404
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,510
kind of up for anything because I just

1405
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:25,539
remember I was reading an article in

1406
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:27,580
Skunk magazine and I believe you wrote

1407
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:30,190
it and it was basically saying that the

1408
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:32,529
white snow Lotus might mistake the snow

1409
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,420
Lotus was some of your favorite personal

1410
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:36,430
smoke and it veered a bit towards the

1411
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,930
sativa side from memory you know is that

1412
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:41,230
kind of how you find things in general

1413
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:43,449
or is that just the snow Lotus you know

1414
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:45,610
I always have liked sativas a lot

1415
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:48,429
because I like psychedelics and I like

1416
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:52,360
kind of that meditative opening up space

1417
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:55,569
and I really like I think sativas have a

1418
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,950
really unique spirit to them like they

1419
00:53:55,570 --> 00:54:00,070
all kind of have their own unique

1420
00:53:56,949 --> 00:54:01,389
personality some are very pushy some are

1421
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,690
you know it's a more a roller coaster

1422
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:07,029
ride some are super creepers there's I

1423
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:08,650
mean I'm sure indica stew but they they

1424
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,360
have these unique properties and each

1425
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:13,090
one kind of opens up like kind of like a

1426
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,470
little higher center in your mind so I

1427
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,809
would say that but you know now as I'm

1428
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:18,579
maturing and I'm getting older I kind of

1429
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:22,869
I've been really enjoying like heady

1430
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:25,809
indicas like you know should be saying

1431
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:28,119
broadleafs but really unique maybe

1432
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:30,369
heirloom or landrace broadleafs that are

1433
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:31,989
deeply relaxing on the body and healing

1434
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:33,969
but at the same time like opens your

1435
00:54:31,989 --> 00:54:35,319
mind almost like a dreamlike state so

1436
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:39,129
I'm really loving kind of like heady and

1437
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,840
because but I like extreme possibilities

1438
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:42,970
I've always looked for plants you know

1439
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,890
that it just body like absolutely no

1440
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:46,929
mind I was like I gotta find that like

1441
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:49,000
how nice would that be just to go out

1442
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:51,609
dancing or say like you're saying or

1443
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,280
about if you're going to meet people are

1444
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:56,680
more social and then I also like

1445
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,050
completely mind like absolutely no body

1446
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:02,619
like some of the Indian lines that I

1447
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:04,740
have are or almost nobody at all and I

1448
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:06,849
even have some ones that you smoked

1449
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:08,559
Vietnamese when you smoke and you don't

1450
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:09,759
really know if you're higher or not

1451
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,099
everything is just kind of slightly

1452
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,720
weird and everything's a little brighter

1453
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:15,039
and it is kind of it just feels like

1454
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:16,689
you're on another planet but you don't

1455
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:18,969
really feel high you're almost like did

1456
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:20,079
I get stoned or what what's going on but

1457
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:22,029
it puts you in a completely different

1458
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,909
state I don't know if that's a an

1459
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:26,910
interaction of multiple cannabinoids or

1460
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:28,980
just this way terpenes interact

1461
00:55:26,909 --> 00:55:30,779
you know it's such a we're still kind of

1462
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,150
in the early stages I'm really figuring

1463
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,750
out why cannabis does what it does to

1464
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:39,809
our physiology do you think that there's

1465
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:42,019
a market now for weed which maybe

1466
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:44,400
doesn't get you just you know completely

1467
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:45,929
stoned so to speak but more what you

1468
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,849
said maybe makes things feel a bit

1469
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:49,618
different I mean the example I often

1470
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:52,710
hear is people say oh I breed for turps

1471
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:54,030
and to me that is kind of saying you're

1472
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:55,679
doing what I said you know you're

1473
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,150
breeding cannabis that's maybe not as

1474
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,358
potent but maybe got an overall

1475
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:01,980
different effect maybe more up someone's

1476
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:03,659
alley who's up for a more sedate of type

1477
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,358
of thing do you think that's a market

1478
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:08,338
worth looking into or do you think maybe

1479
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,548
it's just someone trying to make up for

1480
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:13,619
poor potency within their crosses I mean

1481
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:15,659
maybe both I mean I think as the

1482
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:19,230
emerging kind of recreational market

1483
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:21,000
sweeps over Canada and America and now

1484
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:23,369
we have medical in Mexico and all these

1485
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,048
places are tuning and I think for people

1486
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:26,490
that aren't smokers that have never done

1487
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,798
cannabis I think it's kind of nice to

1488
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:31,348
have training wheels to have something

1489
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:33,659
that's tasty and visceral and and and

1490
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:36,298
great to the senses that is very low THC

1491
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:37,440
that can kind of ease you in if you want

1492
00:56:36,298 --> 00:56:39,239
to keep on going you know if your

1493
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,789
grandma you want to smoke something or

1494
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,259
you don't want to get too high they want

1495
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:45,450
something special and I know now there's

1496
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,680
branded things like sex pot there's that

1497
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:49,558
pot that's supposed to make you feel

1498
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:52,379
sensual and horny and and you know

1499
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,900
there's also then the CBD style stuff

1500
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,760
where the CBD THC things those are kind

1501
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,039
of more you know those are a different

1502
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,819
feeling themselves they seem to be a lot

1503
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,650
more freeing up of the bodies and so

1504
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:07,139
much the mind I think there's I really

1505
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:09,088
think there's a market for any

1506
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:12,028
expression it's just finding that niche

1507
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:13,108
and going there and then also finding

1508
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:16,559
the place that you're going to be able

1509
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:18,298
to then that or you know it's it's

1510
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,339
almost like you have to have a passion

1511
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:24,000
for that specific thing you're going for

1512
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:25,078
else you're never gonna prevail so one

1513
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,909
of the more interesting things I

1514
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:28,829
remember talking to about at the Emerald

1515
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:30,838
cup was how you said you only really

1516
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:33,359
smoke once a day or so and it's more of

1517
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:34,980
like a meditative slash ritual type

1518
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:36,778
thing as opposed to just a recreational

1519
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,519
one would you mind going a little more

1520
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:40,710
into detail about that and kind of how

1521
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:43,079
you do it are you combining say meditate

1522
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:44,909
with smoking or is it more just smoking

1523
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:48,029
and trying to undergo it as a type of

1524
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:49,649
meditation I mean really when I say kind

1525
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,359
of meditation like more it's just like

1526
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:53,838
me time I usually smoke whatever I want

1527
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,940
to sleep here I have three kids and I

1528
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:59,608
I'm hypersensitive to cannabis and all

1529
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,970
kind of plants so I don't need just I

1530
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:04,829
like to take bong hits and if I take a

1531
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:07,108
bong hit during the day it's like I'm

1532
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:09,119
just gonna be staring at plants and not

1533
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:11,429
be able to be working and not being

1534
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,650
really able to interact with my family

1535
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:16,529
so it's kind of like after I'm done with

1536
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:18,960
everything I have all these plants that

1537
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,369
I test and so I have hundreds of

1538
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,079
different strains hanging and I'll be

1539
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:24,059
like okay what are we gonna try tonight

1540
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,630
and I'll you know usually the city

1541
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:30,389
hasn't usually keeps me up all night but

1542
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:33,180
for me it smoking once a day allows me

1543
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:35,309
to not only not bludgeon my

1544
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:36,838
endocannabinoid system but keep me like

1545
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:38,670
sensitive enough that I can really

1546
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:40,679
perceive the individual differences in

1547
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:42,450
plants especially if I'm going through

1548
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:47,149
new lines or different she knows it

1549
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:49,529
really allows me to stay crisp and an

1550
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,480
honorable to the plant like everyone has

1551
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:53,400
their own special relationship to the

1552
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,809
plant I don't I don't going to judge I

1553
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,710
think people that need to smoke it a

1554
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:57,420
hundred times a day

1555
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:59,550
is beautiful if you don't need to smoke

1556
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,760
it once a year that's amazing it's

1557
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:04,650
really how we interact with it and I you

1558
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,540
know I hear some people get kind of like

1559
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:08,280
fooled on or making fun of that they

1560
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:09,690
don't smoke that much or they're light

1561
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,490
weight I think light weight should be

1562
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:14,070
celebrated I think being sensitive to

1563
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:16,559
the plant and knowing how to be

1564
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:18,690
respectful to the plant in in take a

1565
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,759
engage it in a way that they you know

1566
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:23,550
it's a special meeting I think that's

1567
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,460
good and I think that more people should

1568
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:28,470
do that I think sometimes when you smoke

1569
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:30,750
way too much you don't really get to

1570
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:32,519
experience as the nuances you know I

1571
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,780
understand for medical reasons people do

1572
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:35,039
you need to do that and even for

1573
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,410
self-medicate you know things I think

1574
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,900
it's great but I think to keep yourself

1575
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:42,569
really sensitive and clean to if you're

1576
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,490
breathing and really diving deep into

1577
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:47,519
different strains I think it's kind of

1578
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:49,379
good to create a special time that you

1579
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,000
interact with it and for me it's just

1580
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,920
it's late at night and sometimes I

1581
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,099
meditate sometimes I'll listen to music

1582
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,960
some

1583
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:58,119
you notice than that if I do yoga and

1584
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,769
the day our ride mountain bike I'll do

1585
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:01,569
it I don't it's not like I only do it at

1586
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:03,219
night but usually trying to smoke once a

1587
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:06,010
day and that kind of in that what's what

1588
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:07,239
work basically works for me unless I'm

1589
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:09,130
trekking then I'm gonna smoke all day

1590
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:12,939
long as I Trek because that's what I

1591
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:15,099
like to do that's awesome so it's given

1592
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:17,200
you know you're relatively small amount

1593
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:18,730
of consumption compared to say other

1594
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,799
breeders do you find it hard to

1595
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:22,809
personally sample all the plants you

1596
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,400
grow out or I mean my assumption would

1597
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:26,440
be that you must kind of have a group of

1598
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,059
trusted friends who are kind of act as

1599
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,349
your power in a certain regard or do you

1600
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:32,230
still manage to kind of work your way

1601
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:35,259
through a mall you know I do my best to

1602
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:38,139
work through all only of 365 days a year

1603
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:39,730
I do it anyway any friends come over I'm

1604
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:40,869
always like hey you wanna try this want

1605
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:43,240
to try this and like you know I make

1606
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:46,150
bags cuz I learned that my whole garage

1607
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:47,139
is like it it's just hundreds of strains

1608
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,700
and I don't know what to do if I well

1609
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:51,699
usually just they get too old I was

1610
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:53,319
through them over the hill um you know

1611
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:55,179
cuz it's just it's a wonderland but I'm

1612
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,890
always like hey try this try this try

1613
01:00:55,179 --> 01:01:00,339
this true this what I need I wish there

1614
01:00:56,889 --> 01:01:02,109
was some dedicated like super stoners

1615
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,450
that would I could just give like a bag

1616
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:06,220
once a week and be like hey try this and

1617
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:08,829
right I used to have people a long time

1618
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:10,329
ago they're like hey try all these write

1619
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:11,650
down what you think about each one and

1620
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:13,500
give that kind of bag to a couple

1621
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:16,750
different people so I could get more

1622
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,820
kind of insight but these days you know

1623
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:21,730
I'll give a bag to whoever comes over

1624
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:24,340
but really it's kind of just me and you

1625
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:26,409
know I get one one chance each night and

1626
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,960
it usually works pretty good I can do

1627
01:01:26,409 --> 01:01:31,000
you know week I can do fee knows you

1628
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,610
pretty much seven fee notes from a new

1629
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,900
line in a week and take all my notes and

1630
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:37,059
kind of know where I'm going from there

1631
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,119
what what kind of percentage of your day

1632
01:01:37,059 --> 01:01:41,110
do you spend hacking through uncharted

1633
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,289
uncharted territories looking for new

1634
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:46,900
land races yeah that's rare I mean I

1635
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:49,509
it's kind of sad I feel kind of like a

1636
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:52,150
dork I used to really be able to get out

1637
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:54,790
there more and I really like my heart

1638
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:56,829
just soars like my spirit is so happy

1639
01:01:54,789 --> 01:02:00,039
when I'm out in the field like that's

1640
01:01:56,829 --> 01:02:02,409
where I feel at home like just you know

1641
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:04,659
no expectations there's totally out of

1642
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:06,849
your element every every moment is

1643
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:07,329
something new I just mind Spiritist

1644
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:10,569
bobbles

1645
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:12,519
but now with three kids and the business

1646
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:14,710
and all that I'm kind of like stuck and

1647
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:16,570
it drives me crazy I mean now things are

1648
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:17,800
starting to pick up again I just did a

1649
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,590
collection strip with a couple friends

1650
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,530
we bought them all about six months ago

1651
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:26,200
and kind of contemplating a quick one in

1652
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:30,450
Oaxaca in about a month or two I got

1653
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:32,469
some good ideas for a special spot but

1654
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:35,889
date-time it's really you know I do a

1655
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:37,779
lot of trading and I do a lot of seed

1656
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:41,289
popping and I just kind of try and

1657
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:43,630
explore what I have and you know maybe a

1658
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:47,650
day is I wake up late because I go to

1659
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:50,440
red light I usually do kid stuff pick up

1660
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:52,570
kids do this do that and maybe in the

1661
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,099
afternoon I get to do some outdoor then

1662
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:56,050
it's time more kids stuff

1663
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:59,199
dinners with the kids a bit then I go

1664
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:01,990
out and I do indoor stuff and then and

1665
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:04,269
then when everything's done anything

1666
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:05,949
I'll go down to kind of live in a dome

1667
01:03:04,269 --> 01:03:08,230
down on lower proper the property and

1668
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:10,539
I'll just pick something that from

1669
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:14,559
hanging from the ceiling and take a big

1670
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:15,789
bong rip and usually listen to meditate

1671
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,829
listen to music

1672
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:19,619
take notes read just kind of get in my

1673
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:23,949
own space and kind of like kind of

1674
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:25,650
realign with the force I guess and

1675
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:29,619
what's happened to key into my sleep you

1676
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:33,130
know I pretty much like any kind of

1677
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:35,349
music except maybe I'm not so into

1678
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:37,840
contemporary country-western like that

1679
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:40,119
for me and a lot of like you know any of

1680
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,860
the new whatever whatever is on the

1681
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:45,009
radio I'm not so thrilled about like all

1682
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:46,930
the new puffy stuff but I primarily

1683
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:49,600
listen to maybe like I guess people

1684
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:51,399
called bass music a lot of electronic

1685
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,429
music that's heavy on the low frequency

1686
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,050
I also like a lot of older stuff like

1687
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:58,449
about Hendrix and Zeppelin a lot of

1688
01:03:56,050 --> 01:04:01,720
sixties Punk and I even you know some

1689
01:03:58,449 --> 01:04:05,769
some right but mostly I would have to

1690
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:08,469
say it would be classic electronic music

1691
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:10,989
and then newer really psychedelic bass

1692
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:14,649
music and they're like ambient I like

1693
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:17,500
world music you know I like I'm pretty

1694
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:20,010
open but it like wash your hands a lot I

1695
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:24,429
like kirtan

1696
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:26,680
you know I like even listen to podcast I

1697
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:29,169
you know I was like listen to my own

1698
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:30,669
ears but really I think if I had to pick

1699
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:32,619
one thing it would be if I faced music

1700
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:37,990
and I know that sounds strange but

1701
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:39,309
that's me nice so although I was kind of

1702
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:41,049
you know joking a bit of tongue-in-cheek

1703
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:43,779
with the whole hacking through uncharted

1704
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:45,400
territories it kind of is a fairly

1705
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:47,560
accurate statement in many ways at least

1706
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,269
compared to other breeders so how does

1707
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:50,349
that whole process go down you know I

1708
01:04:49,269 --> 01:04:51,759
remember when you're on the Adam Dunn

1709
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:53,860
show you said generally you have a

1710
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,780
contact organizing when you go into a

1711
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,610
different country would you mind filling

1712
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,670
us in a little more on the details of

1713
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:02,380
you know how the average trip goes down

1714
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:06,159
yeah usually you know usually I'll do

1715
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:07,780
some research and I'll pick a place that

1716
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:11,079
I've always wanted to go to that also

1717
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:12,580
has a history of cannabis and you know

1718
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:13,840
I'll do a lot of looking in books and

1719
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:17,670
I'll do a lot of research online and

1720
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:19,870
I'll try and find specific places or

1721
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:23,260
specific strains or try and get clues

1722
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:26,440
and then hopefully I made a friend there

1723
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:29,710
maybe I have a contact it all depends

1724
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,389
and then you know the real thing I try

1725
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,349
and do and sometimes it backfires when I

1726
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:34,900
haven't done it for a while is

1727
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:37,809
synchronicity go to a country go to the

1728
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:41,139
places that you research be the coolest

1729
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:43,659
person you can be you know be who you

1730
01:05:41,139 --> 01:05:45,250
really are open your heart laugh make

1731
01:05:43,659 --> 01:05:46,839
connections with people and usually I

1732
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:48,610
travel alone recently I've been taking

1733
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,289
French which is really fun but I used to

1734
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,110
travel alone so I'd meet a lot of people

1735
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:54,360
and you just kind of develop

1736
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:56,650
relationships and I swear

1737
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:59,050
synchronicities happen like people you

1738
01:05:56,650 --> 01:06:00,849
know from point A to point B just follow

1739
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:03,640
the clues and they'll usually take you

1740
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:05,679
to where you need to be you know and I

1741
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:08,199
usually play I love to choose places

1742
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:10,149
where I can track like kind of get up

1743
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:12,460
into the mountains and mountain people

1744
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:14,849
are so friendly and you just have to be

1745
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:18,190
really respectful you know I try and I

1746
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:20,500
never bring in my own seeds I always

1747
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:22,960
bring in like heirloom vegetable seeds

1748
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,210
I'll spring in like antibiotics I love

1749
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,670
to bring in pencils chocolate I like to

1750
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:29,320
like really give them myself and I

1751
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:31,059
always bring these fake teeth and crazy

1752
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,340
glasses cuz I like to make people crack

1753
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:36,130
up and smile and make the kids laugh and

1754
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:37,300
the key to you know I think anyone that

1755
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,710
loves cannabis and anyone who loves

1756
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,140
traveling I think it's our birthright

1757
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:44,139
and it's our duty to get out there and

1758
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:45,730
save those strains you know and even if

1759
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:47,170
you can't go and you say you're a big

1760
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:49,750
commercial person you have trimmers

1761
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:52,210
where do trimmers go after they trim all

1762
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:54,639
summer they go to Thailand they go to

1763
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:57,730
Guatemala you talk to your trimmers go

1764
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:59,440
hey bring you back some seeds or even

1765
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:01,990
better talk to your dad's old hippie

1766
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,150
friend see if he's got any I mean you

1767
01:07:01,989 --> 01:07:05,799
got to follow every single Avenue but I

1768
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:07,420
really think people should Trek if they

1769
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,150
like to travel they like cannabis get

1770
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:13,599
out there and really show the world like

1771
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:15,670
how cool we are and make those lasting

1772
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,679
connections and you know help people out

1773
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:19,000
and let them help you out and I think

1774
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:22,989
that's one way that we can really make

1775
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,239
this a better planet yeah really

1776
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:26,919
so you kind of touched on the topic

1777
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:29,949
without trying to throw anyone under the

1778
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:33,250
bus how do you feel about you know the

1779
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:35,379
idea of trading more hybridized seeds

1780
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:37,300
for landrace seeds to you know the

1781
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,920
farmers in these countries is that just

1782
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:41,230
a personal choice you decide not to do

1783
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,349
or do you think as a kind of modern

1784
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:46,929
society we have a an obligation to not

1785
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:48,969
do that even these people may not fully

1786
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:53,169
understand the implications of you know

1787
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:54,429
cross pollination yeah I think it's a

1788
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:56,050
it's a hard one I think it's a really

1789
01:07:54,429 --> 01:07:57,579
ethnocentric for you to bring in

1790
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,650
anything that we think is like super

1791
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:01,029
awesome and try and replace it was

1792
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,110
someone that they already have that they

1793
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,670
have a history of it that their

1794
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:05,440
ancestors grew it that it's part of

1795
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,180
their collective consciousness that it's

1796
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,670
weave through their toil and their sweat

1797
01:08:07,179 --> 01:08:11,500
you know it's like these plants that

1798
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:12,789
have been grown in these areas except

1799
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,500
now with you know rapid

1800
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:17,739
commercialization and also even with

1801
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,779
drug cartels and and people bringing in

1802
01:08:17,739 --> 01:08:21,608
stuff to try and pump out a lot of stuff

1803
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:23,108
for foreign markets it's like these

1804
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:25,150
strains are special they're magic

1805
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:26,710
they're timeless they weave through

1806
01:08:25,149 --> 01:08:28,599
cultures they weave through people's

1807
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:32,350
lives and it holds a lot of information

1808
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:35,170
and I think the that it's it's criminal

1809
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:37,390
to take in especially feminized genetics

1810
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:39,039
into these cannabis hot spots I think

1811
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:41,829
it's really short-sighted I think it's

1812
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:45,069
it's it's not a smart thing at all and I

1813
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:47,229
mean it's one thing you know I've opened

1814
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:49,690
up a little bit because I've met some

1815
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:53,439
really cool cannabis breeders in other

1816
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:55,119
countries and I mean you know considered

1817
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,729
sending stuff and I'm like you know if

1818
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,989
you're growing way out in some mountain

1819
01:08:57,729 --> 01:09:00,759
valley where there's not a lot of

1820
01:08:58,989 --> 01:09:02,679
cultivation and you're just doing your

1821
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,600
thing as a modern cannabis guy sure you

1822
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,550
know that'll be fun to trade seeds and

1823
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:10,260
do this but if you're in an area that

1824
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:12,279
has like it you know the eons old

1825
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:14,020
traditions of working with certain

1826
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:16,359
strains and certain areas that have

1827
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:17,950
developed over time and are you know

1828
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:20,679
that are made for those areas to bring

1829
01:09:17,949 --> 01:09:23,380
in something else it's just so so wrong

1830
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:25,539
and it's so sad and it really it sets up

1831
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:28,260
for a global homogenization that's you

1832
01:09:25,539 --> 01:09:30,340
know we're just we're gonna basically

1833
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:34,270
we're just gonna braid ourselves right

1834
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:35,980
into a hole and so I definitely think we

1835
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:38,440
shouldn't be thinking for genetics into

1836
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:41,949
cannabis hot spots you know but there

1837
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:46,539
are exceptions but that's my feeling and

1838
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:48,939
I think yeah I mean she reaches on now

1839
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:51,970
I'm not gonna pass judgment but I really

1840
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:55,169
think it's a bad idea so I read a post

1841
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:58,210
recently from your buddy sonic seeds and

1842
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:00,130
he said that he's working with some

1843
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:02,800
landrace Jamaican seeds he got from her

1844
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:04,539
body but he's in kind of analysis of it

1845
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,579
all was that they weren't in fact

1846
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:09,159
landrace Jamaican seeds but more just

1847
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:11,529
kind of acclimatized watered down super

1848
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:13,420
Silver Haze hybrids from kind of all the

1849
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:15,699
imported genetics of years gone by that

1850
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:17,109
had polluted the pool so to speak have

1851
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:18,609
you ever felt a similar thing happened

1852
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:21,099
with any seeds you've brought back only

1853
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:22,599
to kind of find because this is the kind

1854
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,770
of follow up question is most of the

1855
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,539
time when you're getting the seeds it's

1856
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:27,850
probably you know you probably don't

1857
01:10:25,539 --> 01:10:29,859
have a really amazing representation of

1858
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,180
flower side by side for a do so you

1859
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:32,559
probably have got to kind of wait till

1860
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:34,600
you get back home and grow it out before

1861
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,910
you really know what's inside there or

1862
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:39,370
is that not the case what depends if

1863
01:10:36,909 --> 01:10:42,369
you're doing if you're doing collections

1864
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:44,140
doing bag seed testing and sampling or

1865
01:10:42,369 --> 01:10:46,899
if you're actually seeing the plants and

1866
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:48,190
collecting seeds directly from the

1867
01:10:46,899 --> 01:10:49,869
plants I think then you really get to

1868
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:51,639
see what's going on and you can kind of

1869
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:53,439
tell whether you know things are modern

1870
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,329
hybrids are or have that or if you're

1871
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:57,250
more in the tropics if they're like true

1872
01:10:55,329 --> 01:11:00,340
equatorial but I mean it's kind of a

1873
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:03,948
unique question because the big

1874
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:06,229
our trip to Guatemala was all about

1875
01:11:03,948 --> 01:11:07,698
trying to reclaim the strain that I had

1876
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:09,349
long ago that was one of the best

1877
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:13,488
strains I've ever smoked in my life and

1878
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:15,440
so in Guatemala there's a sister Lake to

1879
01:11:13,488 --> 01:11:17,629
Lake Tahoe it's a caldera Lake it's a

1880
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,248
lake that he was a volcano that's been

1881
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:21,859
filled with water and it has its own

1882
01:11:19,248 --> 01:11:24,170
microclimates it's called a lager Lake

1883
01:11:21,859 --> 01:11:27,439
atitlán it's this amazing beautiful Lake

1884
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:32,328
but the classic thing is ever since the

1885
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:33,978
80s I don't know if you know how many

1886
01:11:32,328 --> 01:11:35,868
dead shows everyone's been to but you

1887
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:37,699
know the 80s and 90s everybody wore like

1888
01:11:35,868 --> 01:11:38,899
Guatemalan shirts and Guatemalan shirts

1889
01:11:37,698 --> 01:11:40,308
and it's kind of like the style and

1890
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:43,339
you'd sell them on straight down street

1891
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:44,929
so a lot of those vendors when tour

1892
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,729
wasn't going on they would go down to

1893
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:48,529
the lake and be buying up the clothes

1894
01:11:46,729 --> 01:11:49,760
and they'd also bring down their lot see

1895
01:11:48,529 --> 01:11:52,518
it's like you know they're basically

1896
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,860
their dead family seeds and they would

1897
01:11:52,519 --> 01:11:57,079
grow them and those seeds

1898
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:59,179
I think hybridized and pollinated some

1899
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:02,328
of the local sativa varieties and you

1900
01:11:59,179 --> 01:12:04,989
were getting these really unique plants

1901
01:12:02,328 --> 01:12:09,529
that were kind of like dead lot meats

1902
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:12,439
sativas and then they were you know

1903
01:12:09,529 --> 01:12:14,569
bringing over cycles over seasons and

1904
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:16,848
they were climate izing and becoming

1905
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:19,639
heirlooms and you had these amazing

1906
01:12:16,849 --> 01:12:23,599
amazing combos of basically ancestral

1907
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:25,069
sativas and deadlock seeds and so that

1908
01:12:23,599 --> 01:12:28,219
was kind of my goal was to kind of go

1909
01:12:25,069 --> 01:12:29,899
down there and see really if those were

1910
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:32,569
still available because I'd had sampled

1911
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:33,978
it before in the past and and when I got

1912
01:12:32,569 --> 01:12:37,819
down there I realized that you know what

1913
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:40,400
there's so much people bringing in so

1914
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:41,808
many genetics from a lot of trimmers are

1915
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:43,728
going down there especially the San

1916
01:12:41,809 --> 01:12:47,360
Pedro and setting up shop there's a lot

1917
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:49,610
of growers diminutive to America and

1918
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:51,978
buying from seed bags that the lake is

1919
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:53,569
pretty polluted you know it's it's the

1920
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:54,739
gene pools pretty fluid it's unique and

1921
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,988
it's special they're getting to try new

1922
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:59,629
things before really stoked but those

1923
01:12:56,988 --> 01:13:02,448
deep older lines from like the 90s and

1924
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:03,920
early 2000s even are seem to be gone or

1925
01:13:02,448 --> 01:13:07,248
maybe I just didn't get a chance to look

1926
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:09,469
deep enough but you know there's still

1927
01:13:07,248 --> 01:13:12,590
that there's a plant down there called

1928
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:13,699
what's it called Manjeet oh that's kind

1929
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:15,880
of like there

1930
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:18,159
their blue dream down there like the

1931
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,750
Guatemalan attrition of my dream I guess

1932
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:22,460
you know it's grown all over Guatemala I

1933
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:24,409
think it's like a throwback from like an

1934
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:26,090
earlier time and it has some really

1935
01:13:24,409 --> 01:13:27,439
unique effects people don't seem to

1936
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,579
really like it that much I thought I was

1937
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,799
kind of cool cuz it makes you absolutely

1938
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:32,720
stupid it's like one of the strains

1939
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,119
where you just like stare and laugh like

1940
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,619
I think that's kind of neat and you know

1941
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,029
we brought that back but that's being

1942
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:39,500
hybridized with the law and there's some

1943
01:13:38,029 --> 01:13:41,210
really cool people there's a lot of cool

1944
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,119
Ottomans there's a lot of new breeding

1945
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:45,980
going down there but you know that

1946
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:49,130
finding land races is difficult there

1947
01:13:45,979 --> 01:13:52,429
now and then you know there's you can go

1948
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:54,800
to the jungle the patina is cultivated

1949
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:55,909
but a lot of the organized cartels of

1950
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,770
moving in there and they're pumping

1951
01:13:55,909 --> 01:13:59,569
stuff out so it's like it's happening

1952
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:01,970
everywhere in Mexico you know Jamaica is

1953
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:04,219
a good is a really good way to see it's

1954
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:06,680
like Jamaica had so much early Dutch

1955
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:08,150
stuff brought in that it it basically is

1956
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,880
a lot of the island is these Dutch

1957
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:12,259
Jamaican hybrids and now they've kind of

1958
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,270
turned into heirlooms and sure there's

1959
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:16,070
Rastas that sob the Lambs breath and

1960
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:18,500
stuff but really must the island is a

1961
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:20,179
unique kind of like Dutch Jamaican

1962
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,949
hybrid that's turned into an heirloom so

1963
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:24,470
I mean in a way that's kind of cool

1964
01:14:21,949 --> 01:14:25,939
because you're kidding you're I still

1965
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:27,500
love hybrids and I still love when

1966
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:30,889
things come together for the first time

1967
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:32,239
and kind of make this unique love but at

1968
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:34,640
the same time the world's being

1969
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:36,649
homogenized very quickly very fastly I

1970
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,750
don't think it's gonna slow down at all

1971
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:40,509
I think it's only gonna gonna get faster

1972
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:42,619
and faster and faster until we're all

1973
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:46,730
basically everything is going to look

1974
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:49,460
and smell pretty much the same so on

1975
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:51,139
that idea of land races which one kind

1976
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,909
of interests you the most in terms of

1977
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:55,850
moving forward with it we often hear

1978
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:58,460
people talk about very reminiscently you

1979
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,900
know Thai do you feel that maybe Thai

1980
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:01,550
hogs the spotlight a bit and there's

1981
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:03,619
another land race that deserves a bit of

1982
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:05,150
a mention that if it did come back into

1983
01:15:03,619 --> 01:15:07,449
the mainstream conscious you know it

1984
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:10,609
really rocked people's world so to speak

1985
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:12,260
yeah I mean a good time in it Thai it

1986
01:15:10,609 --> 01:15:15,529
comes down to being people being able to

1987
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:18,010
like grow it correctly and and you know

1988
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:21,050
really find a way to see what I think

1989
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:24,980
really for maybe I think as cannabis

1990
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:27,230
becomes globally legal and we start to

1991
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:29,539
see these like trade deals where

1992
01:15:27,229 --> 01:15:32,269
we're actually gonna get stuff you know

1993
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:34,130
shipped over from Thailand Colombia all

1994
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:36,440
these places we used to kind of get it I

1995
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:40,810
think then maybe because it's you know

1996
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:43,159
from my experience smoking like

1997
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:45,080
landraces at the point of origin and

1998
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:46,488
then coming home and growing them and

1999
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:47,869
smoking it it's like completely

2000
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:50,059
different well it's kind of like one's

2001
01:15:47,869 --> 01:15:51,949
like a light version like because the

2002
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:54,890
plants developed its you know in a

2003
01:15:51,949 --> 01:15:56,090
specific environment Tharoor also you

2004
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,650
know there's a lot of things going to

2005
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:59,840
cultural heritage there's so much

2006
01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:02,750
information in epigenetics that that

2007
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,039
that we've through these plants in the

2008
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,539
places that they've been for so long

2009
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:07,399
that they've really developed their

2010
01:16:05,539 --> 01:16:10,220
vital essence and you know ice local

2011
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:11,599
hock and in Oaxaca that just blew my

2012
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,699
mind and I'll bring it back here and it

2013
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,400
was kind of where and it's you know if

2014
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:18,260
maybe after a couple seasons of getting

2015
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:19,639
used to the new environment and you know

2016
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:21,739
keep cleaning a couple secessions of

2017
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:23,989
seeds they can adapt and bring out some

2018
01:16:21,738 --> 01:16:25,429
of its qualities I don't think we're

2019
01:16:23,988 --> 01:16:27,199
really gonna get rocked by these land

2020
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:29,030
races until we can really start

2021
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,920
importing them from their points of

2022
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:33,469
origin I mean you know there's people

2023
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,750
that really do you excel at drawing and

2024
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:37,220
sativas indoors and really finding the

2025
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,890
niche I have a couple friends that do

2026
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:41,930
great jobs and you know I think that

2027
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:43,970
there are lines that have been in Kalama

2028
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,170
ties especially older lines you know

2029
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:46,460
back from the eighties and stuff that

2030
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,810
have been around forever that wear a tie

2031
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,720
that we kind of got climatized to our

2032
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:53,750
mountains you can still get those

2033
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:56,480
effects but really I don't know I mean

2034
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:58,250
and even stuff like tie you know tie

2035
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,259
gene pools been pretty polluted I think

2036
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:01,670
the only way to really find some of

2037
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:03,560
these Southeast Asians that are really

2038
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:05,210
noteworthy is to go deep kind of like

2039
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:07,420
that Lau Asian strain I brought back

2040
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:11,510
that was kind of right on the border of

2041
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:13,970
China and Burma and it was way up up in

2042
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:16,400
kind of the high high Highland for us so

2043
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:18,470
it was it wasn't the lowland kind of

2044
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,329
like humid tropical was like I got

2045
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:21,680
Jurassic Park style thinking it was

2046
01:17:20,329 --> 01:17:23,630
pretty untouched and it really had its

2047
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,789
own unique essence I think people are

2048
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,900
gonna really really want to find unique

2049
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:28,640
and rare stuff we're gonna have to

2050
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:31,699
really get back up in there

2051
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:34,160
or dig into older stuff I think you know

2052
01:17:31,699 --> 01:17:36,859
I heard Rob Clark I think it's real

2053
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:38,659
Clark say that you know the best land

2054
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:40,469
races are going to be found in your you

2055
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:43,289
know your dad's friends collection or

2056
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:45,210
thing it's like I think old seeds are

2057
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:48,689
kind of these special treasure chests

2058
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:50,609
that hold a lot of the magic you can

2059
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:52,948
even though there are still hotspots

2060
01:17:50,609 --> 01:17:54,988
that contain amazing genetics I think

2061
01:17:52,948 --> 01:17:57,059
it's really about recovering a lot of

2062
01:17:54,988 --> 01:17:59,698
stuff we have here especially in

2063
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:01,739
California and all across the states

2064
01:17:59,698 --> 01:18:04,710
were you know it's been grown it's in

2065
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:06,929
prohibition I think you know talking to

2066
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:08,939
old people like connecting reaching out

2067
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:10,500
I mean and now's the time to sprout

2068
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:14,210
those things I mean get them out get

2069
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:16,590
them going you know get that germ plasm

2070
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:18,359
out and about because it's it's only

2071
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:20,909
getting older and I think maybe it's

2072
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:23,099
that's the kind of safer bridge there's

2073
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:24,659
is getting deep into the bush and then

2074
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:28,620
also getting deep into people's

2075
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:31,399
collections so what the oldest seeds

2076
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:34,349
you've ever been having to germinate oh

2077
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:38,159
that's a good question I mean our shrine

2078
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:41,280
is for old ones I can get them to pop

2079
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:42,920
but they never come up you know I use

2080
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:45,359
seed bombs and all kinds of weird

2081
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,949
popping strategies and I have friends

2082
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:48,149
that can do pretty good getting really

2083
01:18:46,948 --> 01:18:51,269
old ones I'm trying to think what's my

2084
01:18:48,149 --> 01:18:52,829
oldest I don't even know I mean most

2085
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:54,780
likely probably 80s I have a lot of

2086
01:18:52,829 --> 01:19:00,149
seeds from the 70s that I can't seem to

2087
01:18:54,779 --> 01:19:02,279
get to go I guess would be either you

2088
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:04,948
know a lot of times some of these old

2089
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:07,050
old ones are there being refreshed every

2090
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:08,849
like nine years or you know they came

2091
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:11,070
from somebody's dad who had them and

2092
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:13,140
then their uncle made more nine years

2093
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:14,609
later and then someone else made you

2094
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:16,560
know they kind of they're being

2095
01:19:14,609 --> 01:19:19,399
refreshed and that's one way that I keep

2096
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,900
getting a thing I don't know you know

2097
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:24,869
there was a really kind gentleman that

2098
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:26,819
came on Instagram from Alaska that like

2099
01:19:24,869 --> 01:19:28,260
buried a bunch of seeds and he has a lot

2100
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:30,779
of cool stuff from these and he's

2101
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:33,180
getting great germination and so I mean

2102
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:34,590
it it's all about storage really and

2103
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:37,170
it's about people that have kept that

2104
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:38,489
vibe alive and are now kind of as the

2105
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:40,079
laws are lifting and people are being

2106
01:19:38,488 --> 01:19:41,369
more comfortable they're like people are

2107
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,289
coming out with their treasures and I

2108
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:45,809
think that's a it's really it's a kind

2109
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:47,850
of a gift to the community is that as we

2110
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:49,050
legalize things they're kind of coming

2111
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:52,230
to the surface that we never really

2112
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:54,279
thought with the wood so do you think

2113
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:56,769
that if people do you know

2114
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:59,948
how should we say metaphorically find

2115
01:19:56,770 --> 01:20:01,719
the seeds in the dad's friends little

2116
01:19:59,948 --> 01:20:03,759
stash case do you think that people

2117
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:06,100
should you know try their best efforts

2118
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,960
if possible to try to do a bit of a Tom

2119
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,600
hill in this situation and you know do

2120
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:12,640
the open pollination and try to you know

2121
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,469
generate that large a stock cool to work

2122
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:19,270
with without bottlenecking it such that

2123
01:20:14,469 --> 01:20:20,560
we can then work further yeah I think if

2124
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:22,600
something's really special I think you

2125
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,730
should always open pollinate it you know

2126
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,260
and I and there's there's ways to get

2127
01:20:24,729 --> 01:20:29,109
there's kind of like fun tips and ways

2128
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:30,510
to get it to have fun with it and still

2129
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:32,979
over pollinate you can do like a

2130
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:35,679
targeted open pollination where you do a

2131
01:20:32,979 --> 01:20:37,389
bunch of seeds and you kind of you pull

2132
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,489
out you know the ones that are are

2133
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:41,230
really not gonna be good for the gene

2134
01:20:39,488 --> 01:20:43,629
pool but who's to say what that but you

2135
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:46,029
can kind of narrow it down I prefer like

2136
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:48,010
a total open pollination and then from

2137
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:49,809
there I'll I'll pick my favorites a

2138
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,070
couple favorites from that open

2139
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:52,539
pollination and I'll save those backs

2140
01:20:51,069 --> 01:20:54,759
with clones and kind of work with those

2141
01:20:52,539 --> 01:20:56,649
but every time I get like a unique seed

2142
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:58,090
line like I have an old-timer friend

2143
01:20:56,649 --> 01:20:59,920
that once in a while sends me some more

2144
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:01,960
really special cool stuff and the first

2145
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,969
thing I always do is I do an open

2146
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,609
pollination make a bunch send him back

2147
01:21:03,969 --> 01:21:08,230
some keep those and then I'll kind of

2148
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:09,609
work from those from the ones that I

2149
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:10,928
selected from the initial open

2150
01:21:09,609 --> 01:21:13,238
pollination that I really kind of

2151
01:21:10,929 --> 01:21:15,489
connected with but yeah I think it's

2152
01:21:13,238 --> 01:21:20,139
important to keep that gene pool and

2153
01:21:15,488 --> 01:21:21,909
that kind of open and contained for the

2154
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,869
future even if you can go back and you

2155
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:25,809
know it's great to have that you know

2156
01:21:22,869 --> 01:21:27,789
what if your grow room dies or there's a

2157
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:29,739
storm comes by or you know the power's

2158
01:21:27,789 --> 01:21:33,310
out it's easy to lose clones it but it's

2159
01:21:29,738 --> 01:21:36,488
it's hard to lose seeds yeah plant the

2160
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:38,530
tree so just kind of living back to a

2161
01:21:36,488 --> 01:21:41,289
previous question have you found any

2162
01:21:38,529 --> 01:21:43,960
land races that seemed to be

2163
01:21:41,289 --> 01:21:45,880
particularly compatible with modern

2164
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,810
strains you know most likely you would

2165
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,579
have probably found this through

2166
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:50,230
supernatural selections and then the

2167
01:21:48,579 --> 01:21:52,300
flip side of that the opposite you know

2168
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:54,459
have you found any modern strains you

2169
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:56,529
know maybe an elite clone so to speak

2170
01:21:54,460 --> 01:22:02,198
that seems to work quite well with land

2171
01:21:56,529 --> 01:22:04,779
races that's a good one the funny thing

2172
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:06,428
is a lot of the elite clones they work

2173
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:07,779
good with land races were kind of like

2174
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:09,609
all

2175
01:22:07,779 --> 01:22:11,699
clones there were originally landraces

2176
01:22:09,609 --> 01:22:14,909
kind of are ones that have been kind of

2177
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:19,420
inbred quite a bit because I mean Nikita

2178
01:22:14,909 --> 01:22:22,059
- you know - f1 hybrids is really

2179
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,739
getting inbred lines so if you're taking

2180
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:25,030
two inbred lines and you're putting

2181
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:26,439
together they're very distinct they

2182
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:28,809
don't have a lot in common you bring

2183
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:30,250
them together you get that true f1

2184
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:32,710
hybrid vigor where you're getting this

2185
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:35,220
like explosion of life force and you're

2186
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:37,329
getting this this really unique

2187
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:40,659
combination of genes and they display

2188
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:43,000
pretty pretty stable and pretty similar

2189
01:22:40,659 --> 01:22:44,529
in that first cross and they just blow

2190
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,869
everything away with vigor and they have

2191
01:22:44,529 --> 01:22:48,460
amazing root systems and they really

2192
01:22:46,869 --> 01:22:51,729
shine and then from there I mean you can

2193
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:54,279
have tuned stuff but I really think the

2194
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:56,559
best things to mix with land races our

2195
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:58,659
other highly inbred elite clones are

2196
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,220
highly inbred clones have been kept out

2197
01:22:58,659 --> 01:23:02,139
for a while and I think that's where you

2198
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:04,360
get the best results you know and then

2199
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:06,100
it's always fun to play like I think oh

2200
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:09,219
geez are fun to cross anything into an

2201
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:11,560
OG because OG such a cool plant and then

2202
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,600
across an a crazy land race it's like

2203
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,970
then you get these really kind of weird

2204
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,770
unique accents or really freaky you get

2205
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:19,119
freaky buds with an OG smell but a

2206
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,860
completely different structure it's kind

2207
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,050
of fun to take your favorite things and

2208
01:23:20,859 --> 01:23:25,839
just kind of hit them with the magic

2209
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:29,020
stick and see what crazy stuff comes out

2210
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,970
you know what's your favorite OG to work

2211
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:33,430
with and then secondly have you ever

2212
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:35,079
found when you you know did hit stuff

2213
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:37,570
with the magic stick so to speak I like

2214
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:38,680
that expression by the way if you ever

2215
01:23:37,569 --> 01:23:41,259
found that just something just

2216
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:43,720
completely you know the most unique

2217
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:45,220
exotic smell you know maybe never even

2218
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,930
encountered it before in cannabis you

2219
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:50,320
know have you ever had that happened to

2220
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:53,350
you yeah definitely I think especially

2221
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:55,239
with with a really unique and special

2222
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:58,360
and very like super especially with like

2223
01:23:55,239 --> 01:24:00,159
the super super heavy Terp plants when

2224
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:01,929
you put two really unique to your plants

2225
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,880
together sometimes you get the weirdest

2226
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:05,560
wildest smell you would have never

2227
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,630
thought and then sometimes they cancel

2228
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:09,130
each other out which is always weird

2229
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,300
like you get the two smelliest plants

2230
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:12,550
and like oh this is gonna be the

2231
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:14,739
ultimate and you throw them together and

2232
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:16,630
then like somehow they cancel there

2233
01:24:14,739 --> 01:24:19,000
smells out and then sometimes you'll get

2234
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:19,650
crazy stuff like you put an OG and a

2235
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,100
blueberry

2236
01:24:19,649 --> 01:24:25,019
you get onions out or you know it's like

2237
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:27,030
it it's the way the genes combined is

2238
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,620
just so amazing and magical and it might

2239
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:30,448
be you know sometimes it could be

2240
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:32,609
recessive genetic she could be backing

2241
01:24:30,448 --> 01:24:37,039
something that came from you know an

2242
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:39,539
earlier earlier generation and yeah I

2243
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:41,698
think it's just it's fun that's why I

2244
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:43,198
always say find like a targeted female

2245
01:24:41,698 --> 01:24:44,908
like a female that you know and you've

2246
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:47,339
always used in your breeding that you

2247
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:48,929
can put your new pollen on and really

2248
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,150
see what it does so you can see what

2249
01:24:48,929 --> 01:24:53,100
that kind of brings to a cross and then

2250
01:24:51,149 --> 01:24:55,408
I think my favorite Oh G to work with it

2251
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:57,420
was that Nepali Oh G but you know I no

2252
01:24:55,408 --> 01:24:59,189
longer have it but out of all the oh

2253
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:01,579
geez I ever worked with that one would

2254
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:04,139
always consistently make the best

2255
01:25:01,579 --> 01:25:05,850
hybrids and I mean besides the ancient

2256
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:08,699
Oh G besides the Iranian did really good

2257
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:11,039
too and I think that they you know if it

2258
01:25:08,698 --> 01:25:14,099
wasn't Oh G I think did it

2259
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:18,590
it would it was probably closer to that

2260
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:20,969
kind of Grass Valley Tahoe kind of

2261
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:25,560
emanation of oh gee that was there for a

2262
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:27,420
while okay there's kind of like a point

2263
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:31,170
of contention within the communities but

2264
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:33,960
two schools of thought one is that we've

2265
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:37,949
made the land races more potent and

2266
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:41,158
maybe arguably more flavorful however we

2267
01:25:37,948 --> 01:25:43,109
have potentially lost certain

2268
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:45,750
characteristics the other the other

2269
01:25:43,109 --> 01:25:47,609
argument is that the new the new strains

2270
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:50,158
while definitively being may be more

2271
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:51,719
flavorful or having certain savers that

2272
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:54,179
weren't accessible in the land race

2273
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:56,369
roots are not as potent do you think

2274
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:57,750
that the land races were more potent and

2275
01:25:56,369 --> 01:26:00,920
we've watered it down or that we've

2276
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,920
refined it for the better

2277
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:08,150
um I think both things I think human

2278
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:11,429
selecting plants to their you know each

2279
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:12,629
each season smoking the stuff finding

2280
01:26:11,429 --> 01:26:13,980
their favorite things and just going

2281
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:15,569
with that each year and each year is

2282
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:17,488
like that's the amazing thing as humans

2283
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:19,500
we can do is I was thinking of like you

2284
01:26:17,488 --> 01:26:21,809
know gene pools is energy and then where

2285
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:24,810
the awareness that we bring to it so in

2286
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:26,550
a way I think you know of course you if

2287
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:28,440
you've really been deep in the bush

2288
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:30,570
there's a lot of jungly cannabis and

2289
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:32,189
it's pretty junky like I wouldn't a lot

2290
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:33,469
of stuff in the Himalayas a lot of stuff

2291
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:35,089
that's scaped into the wild

2292
01:26:33,469 --> 01:26:37,309
even earlier than escaping the well they

2293
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:40,699
kind of revert back to their their own

2294
01:26:37,309 --> 01:26:43,070
kind of vibe and it's pretty you know

2295
01:26:40,698 --> 01:26:46,129
it's pretty jungly it's pretty rough I

2296
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:47,658
mean from a roughing perspective it can

2297
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,979
be some of the best hash ever because

2298
01:26:47,658 --> 01:26:50,779
it's you know these plants are just

2299
01:26:48,979 --> 01:26:52,400
they're horrible to look at but the

2300
01:26:50,779 --> 01:26:53,029
resin that come to office is truly

2301
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:56,149
amazing

2302
01:26:53,029 --> 01:26:58,639
but I think it's kind of like our duty

2303
01:26:56,149 --> 01:27:01,308
to kind of push it in the ways that we

2304
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:03,050
want to as artists working with the you

2305
01:27:01,309 --> 01:27:09,019
know the plant spirit and the cannabis

2306
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:11,779
realm and then at the same time I think

2307
01:27:09,019 --> 01:27:13,909
we do lose certain things like I was

2308
01:27:11,779 --> 01:27:15,889
talking to rob Clark about this like

2309
01:27:13,908 --> 01:27:17,658
what makes all the old strains so

2310
01:27:15,889 --> 01:27:21,229
different and he's like oh they were

2311
01:27:17,658 --> 01:27:23,748
more mono turfy like Mexican had this

2312
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:25,460
effect because it had just one kind of

2313
01:27:23,748 --> 01:27:27,288
terpene signature I like one

2314
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,849
you know like lemon or something where

2315
01:27:27,288 --> 01:27:30,948
and it would take you this way where

2316
01:27:28,849 --> 01:27:32,479
another one from this like Colombia it

2317
01:27:30,948 --> 01:27:34,460
was kind of a monitor but had just the

2318
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:35,960
smell and this so people remember like

2319
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,550
he's Colombian raised with a certain

2320
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,710
smell or Panama with a certain smell and

2321
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:42,920
and so they had these they weren't so

2322
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:44,510
mashed up the whole global cannabis gene

2323
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:45,949
pool wasn't mashed together in all these

2324
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,630
ways creating all these different genes

2325
01:27:45,948 --> 01:27:49,308
expressing themselves with all these new

2326
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:51,050
smells and combination smells it was

2327
01:27:49,309 --> 01:27:54,229
like there was these very distinct

2328
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:57,590
varietals they had distinct morphology

2329
01:27:54,229 --> 01:28:00,320
they had distinct look they had distinct

2330
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:04,010
smell taste and the effect too because

2331
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:06,948
they were very specific to their you

2332
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:09,650
know single or just a few terpenes and

2333
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:12,439
that's why it held their very held their

2334
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:13,578
uniqueness and as we grew as a cannabis

2335
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:15,379
culture and community and started

2336
01:28:13,578 --> 01:28:17,808
blending all these things together you

2337
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:19,940
really started to blend together a lot

2338
01:28:17,809 --> 01:28:21,860
of the effects kind of almost sometimes

2339
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:23,748
getting me things sometimes muddling but

2340
01:28:21,859 --> 01:28:26,058
I thought I found that really really

2341
01:28:23,748 --> 01:28:28,219
unique and really kind of really

2342
01:28:26,059 --> 01:28:30,288
expanding my mind like wow yeah I guess

2343
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:32,389
so if it came from a specific place in

2344
01:28:30,288 --> 01:28:35,118
this a specific environment in the

2345
01:28:32,389 --> 01:28:36,319
environment forced the plan to do

2346
01:28:35,118 --> 01:28:38,988
certain thing and release certain

2347
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:41,448
terpenes in it you got it in a brick in

2348
01:28:38,988 --> 01:28:42,828
the 70s or 80s from this place of course

2349
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:45,288
it's going to have this unique effect

2350
01:28:42,828 --> 01:28:47,208
and I think that we're kind of losing

2351
01:28:45,288 --> 01:28:49,038
that these unique effects

2352
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:50,748
I think we're get gaining in the smells

2353
01:28:49,038 --> 01:28:53,059
and flavors and aromas and even

2354
01:28:50,748 --> 01:28:57,920
structure than yields but we're really

2355
01:28:53,059 --> 01:28:59,599
losing on the the kind of subtle spirit

2356
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,849
subtle effects that cannabis has to

2357
01:28:59,599 --> 01:29:04,538
offer that we that we no longer kind of

2358
01:29:01,849 --> 01:29:07,309
experience in our modern gene pool

2359
01:29:04,538 --> 01:29:09,050
that's really interesting because I've

2360
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:12,559
always wondered and I posed the question

2361
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:15,260
to mr. solo I said what is it on the

2362
01:29:12,559 --> 01:29:17,510
molecular basis do you think that causes

2363
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:19,369
a strain to quote not have a ceiling

2364
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:22,039
because people often talk about maybe

2365
01:29:19,368 --> 01:29:23,359
Thai for example or haze not having a

2366
01:29:22,038 --> 01:29:25,130
ceiling you know you just keep getting

2367
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:27,948
higher and higher the more you smoke and

2368
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:29,840
so my first thought is well there's got

2369
01:29:27,948 --> 01:29:31,339
to be some you know molecular basis for

2370
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,319
the ceiling and I guess if we kind of

2371
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:35,569
think about what Rob said if it was a

2372
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:38,029
similar kind of thing happening with the

2373
01:29:35,569 --> 01:29:40,728
terpenes that would almost suggest that

2374
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:42,738
some terpenes inhibitory you know if

2375
01:29:40,729 --> 01:29:44,539
maybe monoterpenes led to a high that

2376
01:29:42,738 --> 01:29:47,089
didn't have a ceiling maybe multiple

2377
01:29:44,538 --> 01:29:48,170
terpenes somehow brings in a ceiling do

2378
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,090
you think do you have your own little

2379
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:52,399
kind of hypothesis to what's going on

2380
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:54,349
here yeah you know I've always kind of

2381
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,299
wondered and I always like you know what

2382
01:29:54,349 --> 01:29:59,389
is going on like even when I would get

2383
01:29:56,300 --> 01:30:01,429
like and say like a broadleaf Jamaica

2384
01:29:59,389 --> 01:30:03,319
and and it would I have one you know I'd

2385
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:06,380
be like okay this push more smells kind

2386
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:08,359
of like a haze so why does it have an

2387
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:10,760
effect you know kind of like a down

2388
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:12,259
relaxing thing in this haze that smells

2389
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,998
the same why does it have enough and I'm

2390
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:16,489
like what is going on you know because I

2391
01:30:13,998 --> 01:30:18,529
you know terpenes are usually they kind

2392
01:30:16,488 --> 01:30:20,598
of lead the experience they're you know

2393
01:30:18,529 --> 01:30:22,759
they're either bolstering or are

2394
01:30:20,599 --> 01:30:24,139
cancelling out or making things go

2395
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:27,920
through the blood-brain barrier faster

2396
01:30:24,139 --> 01:30:29,208
or you know or yeah so I was wondering

2397
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,248
that too and I don't know if it's a

2398
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:33,050
combination of like octillery Kent

2399
01:30:31,248 --> 01:30:34,578
cannabinoids mixed with terpenes you

2400
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:37,099
know for awhile people thought maybe a

2401
01:30:34,578 --> 01:30:40,219
lot of the high elevation and a lot of

2402
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:43,099
jungly like equatorial they had THC v

2403
01:30:40,219 --> 01:30:45,800
like something that would kind of lead

2404
01:30:43,099 --> 01:30:48,590
the cannabinoids into you know a more

2405
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:51,170
effective deeper synchrony with your

2406
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:52,729
brain I don't know I would love to it's

2407
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:54,229
that's like one of the things that

2408
01:30:52,729 --> 01:30:56,659
fascinates me and I think that people as

2409
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:59,958
we get more into genetics and terpenes

2410
01:30:56,658 --> 01:31:00,469
and and auxilary cannabinoids that will

2411
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:02,569
kind of

2412
01:31:00,469 --> 01:31:05,359
see but yeah the ceiling thing is wild

2413
01:31:02,569 --> 01:31:08,119
like and even or even legs yeah like

2414
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:09,769
what makes some strains last for so long

2415
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:12,140
like I have some strains that look super

2416
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:13,820
ugly I smoked it and I literally can

2417
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:15,949
feel like I drank a coffee and I'll be

2418
01:31:13,819 --> 01:31:18,829
up all night long but and I smoke maybe

2419
01:31:15,948 --> 01:31:20,210
even a different fee no and it won't do

2420
01:31:18,829 --> 01:31:22,488
the same thing like where are these

2421
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:24,230
ceilings sighs and these like

2422
01:31:22,488 --> 01:31:27,079
long-legged highs it must be the

2423
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:29,500
chemistry uh yeah it's it's really

2424
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:33,500
amazing and I would love to know because

2425
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:36,529
yeah I'm that so it's a fascinating

2426
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:37,789
subject yeah and it would certainly be

2427
01:31:36,529 --> 01:31:40,159
interesting if we could figure out the

2428
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:42,500
answer because presumably we could then

2429
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:45,229
work towards incorporating that ceiling

2430
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:47,180
this ceiling lessness it's probably not

2431
01:31:45,229 --> 01:31:50,718
the best way to phrase it into more

2432
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:52,880
strains but what about oops sorry gone

2433
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:54,890
oh yeah I was just gonna say like what

2434
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,560
about so you know everybody's really

2435
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:59,560
into these pens and I know now the kind

2436
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:01,340
of thing is like a rock and I'm annoyed

2437
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:04,130
compound and then they're putting these

2438
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:05,900
fake terpenes like trademark og

2439
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:08,719
combinations you know they're running up

2440
01:32:05,899 --> 01:32:11,238
through the grass chromatography and

2441
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:13,130
finding which terpenes or however they

2442
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:16,789
do it in each strain and then they can

2443
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:18,050
kind of mimic that so why I love you

2444
01:32:16,789 --> 01:32:21,500
know there's people that make amazing

2445
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:23,329
pens and I like pens for certain things

2446
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:25,729
like traveling and stuff but why does it

2447
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:27,439
seem like pens they just don't have the

2448
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:30,319
spirit there they're kind of like this

2449
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:31,939
muddled kind of basic Highness like I

2450
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:33,649
don't get a lot of different effects

2451
01:32:31,939 --> 01:32:36,799
from a pen it seems to be all very

2452
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:40,759
similar and then why if if if the

2453
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:42,170
highest chirping driven why why why

2454
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:44,239
can't I mean it's you'd think that

2455
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:46,609
people could put in these diverse food

2456
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:48,349
based terpenes and get similar effects

2457
01:32:46,609 --> 01:32:49,219
to the strains like there's got to be

2458
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:50,449
something else

2459
01:32:49,219 --> 01:32:53,659
I don't maybe it's something

2460
01:32:50,448 --> 01:32:55,189
metaphysical I don't even know it's you

2461
01:32:53,659 --> 01:32:58,189
know it kind of boggles my mind it's

2462
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:59,839
like why can't we recreate okay there's

2463
01:32:58,189 --> 01:33:03,319
obviously something magic going on we

2464
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:06,050
haven't figured out yeah if a me I mean

2465
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:09,170
it raises a kind of a parallel issue

2466
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:10,730
where that is will we ever be able to or

2467
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:12,569
maybe another way of putting it is are

2468
01:33:10,729 --> 01:33:14,919
we wasting our time trying to

2469
01:33:12,569 --> 01:33:16,868
artificially replicate the plant when we

2470
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,460
know that it just doesn't seem to really

2471
01:33:16,868 --> 01:33:20,649
compare you know like do you think that

2472
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:23,349
we'd ever get to the stage where you

2473
01:33:20,649 --> 01:33:25,359
could get you know a capsule or a pen

2474
01:33:23,349 --> 01:33:27,489
for example that would completely mimic

2475
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:29,439
say you know like ingestion of the whole

2476
01:33:27,488 --> 01:33:30,549
plant product by a combustion maybe or

2477
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:32,948
something like that or do you think it's

2478
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:34,710
just still you know the technology is

2479
01:33:32,948 --> 01:33:36,488
not there and we don't understand it I

2480
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:38,889
don't know I mean it's the same thing

2481
01:33:36,488 --> 01:33:40,928
kind of with you know modern herbalism

2482
01:33:38,889 --> 01:33:45,630
there's a whole school of pulling out

2483
01:33:40,929 --> 01:33:48,489
the specific Fido chemical and

2484
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:49,960
standardizing that and then sailing that

2485
01:33:48,488 --> 01:33:53,138
as a natural medicine versus a whole

2486
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:55,948
plant extract versus eating you know the

2487
01:33:53,139 --> 01:33:58,359
herb and it's like you know sometimes

2488
01:33:55,948 --> 01:34:01,149
people do spa Jarek like an alchemical

2489
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:02,618
extract there's co2 there's alcohol

2490
01:34:01,149 --> 01:34:04,509
there's all these ways that people try

2491
01:34:02,618 --> 01:34:06,158
and capture the essence of the plant and

2492
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:07,719
I think maybe spirit is probably the

2493
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:09,819
best because it's a more of a

2494
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:13,210
metaphysical thing but you really can't

2495
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:15,189
capture the true you know it's like

2496
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:16,719
anything you can't capture the true

2497
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:19,299
nature it's even like the live music

2498
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:21,819
versus recorded music and I think really

2499
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:23,170
the whole terpene pen thing I think

2500
01:34:21,819 --> 01:34:25,210
that's just more of a commercial thing

2501
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:27,029
it's a cost-effective and I think in the

2502
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:31,118
future sadly what we're going to see is

2503
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:33,609
massive massive massive cannabis farms

2504
01:34:31,118 --> 01:34:38,139
where they're just basically harvesting

2505
01:34:33,609 --> 01:34:41,618
all the tops making raw THC and they're

2506
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:43,748
adding it into these propylene glycol

2507
01:34:41,618 --> 01:34:45,880
with their proprietary mixture of

2508
01:34:43,748 --> 01:34:48,219
terpenes and you get them it's MLM

2509
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:52,480
together I don't think flowers are gonna

2510
01:34:48,219 --> 01:34:54,399
have a place in the future except in the

2511
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:56,138
people that really love and enjoyment

2512
01:34:54,399 --> 01:35:00,279
I think legalization we're gonna see

2513
01:34:56,139 --> 01:35:03,368
just this mass light kind of blah kind

2514
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:05,979
of exposure to just both cannabinoids

2515
01:35:03,368 --> 01:35:08,979
and flavors I don't think yeah I don't

2516
01:35:05,979 --> 01:35:11,078
really see except you know maybe 5% is

2517
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:13,299
gonna be these really deep heads that

2518
01:35:11,078 --> 01:35:15,189
are love their concentrates and they

2519
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:17,998
love their flowers that are you know

2520
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:20,348
we're really utilizing these these

2521
01:35:17,998 --> 01:35:21,788
labor-intensive practices to produce

2522
01:35:20,349 --> 01:35:24,190
this it's kind of like a labor of love

2523
01:35:21,788 --> 01:35:24,889
versus commercialization it's going to

2524
01:35:24,189 --> 01:35:27,919
sad

2525
01:35:24,889 --> 01:35:30,109
that is is an interesting argument in my

2526
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,569
mind I saw a I think it was in the

2527
01:35:30,109 --> 01:35:34,130
states a farm that was producing some

2528
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:35,899
horrible looking plants but their

2529
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:37,699
defense was well this is all just

2530
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:39,049
getting to get converted into extracts

2531
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:41,329
and so it doesn't actually really matter

2532
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:43,250
but it wasn't just the case that these

2533
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:44,600
plants would like you know visually not

2534
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,889
very nice like it was the case that they

2535
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,360
were clearly not very well looked after

2536
01:35:45,889 --> 01:35:49,250
and that's why they didn't look very

2537
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:51,710
good do you feel that that is a

2538
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:54,679
disservice or the fact that they are

2539
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:56,750
producing some product for someone who

2540
01:35:54,679 --> 01:35:59,270
probably needs it and is better off with

2541
01:35:56,750 --> 01:36:01,189
that then nothing is is a good way to go

2542
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:02,600
and I guess the deeper philosophy of

2543
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:04,189
this question ties into the Australian

2544
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:06,650
scene you know I'm of the opinion that

2545
01:36:04,189 --> 01:36:07,759
the the medical system that's being

2546
01:36:06,649 --> 01:36:10,250
prepared to be rolled out in Australia

2547
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,619
is actually kind of a farce and so it's

2548
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:15,079
like should you accept the sub quality

2549
01:36:12,618 --> 01:36:17,539
product and in exchange for having

2550
01:36:15,079 --> 01:36:19,399
accessibility to it or should you deny

2551
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:20,840
that and you know only accept the

2552
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:23,899
highest quality of you know the proper

2553
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:26,179
sort I mean it's conundrum I think

2554
01:36:23,899 --> 01:36:27,769
people generally like need something

2555
01:36:26,179 --> 01:36:29,210
like basically as a medical thing if

2556
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:32,179
they need it for their health and it's

2557
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:34,520
imperative by any means necessary but

2558
01:36:32,179 --> 01:36:37,399
it's the same thing it's like you know

2559
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:38,989
if they have these scraggly cows that

2560
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:41,269
are called diseased and they're all

2561
01:36:38,988 --> 01:36:43,698
caged up and like oh it's okay we're

2562
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:45,350
just making hamburger you know it's like

2563
01:36:43,698 --> 01:36:46,939
that's another thing people need the

2564
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:48,260
protein I mean I don't eat meat so it's

2565
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:51,138
a weird analogy he just kind of popped

2566
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:54,289
into my weird stoner brain but it's like

2567
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:56,359
I think the fee I really think craft

2568
01:36:54,289 --> 01:36:58,850
cannabis has been part of our heritage

2569
01:36:56,359 --> 01:37:00,710
and it's I think that we need to do

2570
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:02,840
everything we can to preserve that but

2571
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:05,270
you know it's a big world and there's a

2572
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:06,650
huge way of coming and it's scary and

2573
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:08,389
that's why another reason why I think

2574
01:37:06,649 --> 01:37:10,460
people should stop bickering and start

2575
01:37:08,389 --> 01:37:11,960
communicating it's like people should be

2576
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:13,698
fighting getting all weird with each

2577
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,960
other it's like there's a huge force

2578
01:37:13,698 --> 01:37:16,879
it's like something wicked this way

2579
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,198
comes it's gonna engulf everybody and I

2580
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,699
think now is the time to create these

2581
01:37:18,198 --> 01:37:22,669
guilds and create these friendships in

2582
01:37:19,698 --> 01:37:24,349
these communities and really everybody

2583
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:27,949
come together because we're gonna be up

2584
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:31,159
against a serious wall that sees cash

2585
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:32,779
over anything and I think we have a

2586
01:37:31,158 --> 01:37:34,819
little bit of a window and it's time to

2587
01:37:32,779 --> 01:37:37,789
kind of get with the picture but you

2588
01:37:34,819 --> 01:37:38,539
know for medicine well if I'm any means

2589
01:37:37,789 --> 01:37:40,699
necessary

2590
01:37:38,539 --> 01:37:42,439
but I think we owe it our fellow humans

2591
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:44,899
to make a compassionate product that

2592
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:47,689
that has our heart and soul because half

2593
01:37:44,899 --> 01:37:49,460
the healing you know even is is what you

2594
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:52,489
put into it there's a there's a vital

2595
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:54,319
essence there's an energy to it and you

2596
01:37:52,489 --> 01:37:56,179
know the body works in mysterious ways

2597
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:57,949
it's you know like even psychosomatic

2598
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,960
wounds and you know placebos and they

2599
01:37:57,949 --> 01:38:02,329
work why because we we believe in it

2600
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:05,869
with their heart so it's like I don't

2601
01:38:02,329 --> 01:38:08,689
know it's it's a tough one yeah so how

2602
01:38:05,869 --> 01:38:11,479
do you think the organic versus

2603
01:38:08,689 --> 01:38:12,949
non-organic argument relates to the

2604
01:38:11,479 --> 01:38:16,219
quality of the product are you of the

2605
01:38:12,949 --> 01:38:17,689
opinion that organic will always kind of

2606
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:20,300
be a better product at least

2607
01:38:17,689 --> 01:38:22,039
holistically as opposed to synthetic or

2608
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:23,449
do you think that there it's you know

2609
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:25,159
kind of just down to the skill of the

2610
01:38:23,449 --> 01:38:27,079
grower and you've had non-organic

2611
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:29,750
product which was quite medicinal or you

2612
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:31,309
know where do you sit on that I mean

2613
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:34,159
it's it's it depends I guess if you're a

2614
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:36,200
master of your craft if you hmm I I

2615
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,519
personally just smoked organic and I

2616
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:40,460
love that it has a connection to the

2617
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:44,090
earth and to the you know the biological

2618
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:46,399
web of the earth and energy into the

2619
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:48,949
dirt into the yes and there's a lot of

2620
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:50,750
forces at play but at the same time you

2621
01:38:48,949 --> 01:38:54,109
know it's also a science it's like

2622
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:55,909
people have you know I've seen like

2623
01:38:54,109 --> 01:38:57,920
online like the jungle boys they they

2624
01:38:55,909 --> 01:38:59,119
looks like they've I haven't sampled it

2625
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,560
but looks like they have it pretty wired

2626
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:02,029
and they produce some pretty amazing

2627
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,580
stuff I haven't seen how it burned or

2628
01:39:02,029 --> 01:39:07,880
how it tastes or what it does but you

2629
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:11,269
know there is a sign science is also an

2630
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:13,430
another tool that people wield and very

2631
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:16,880
effective and amazing ways and if you

2632
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:18,619
can create a quality product that people

2633
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,319
enjoy it's mostly a market thing if

2634
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:23,479
people want to smoke synthetically grown

2635
01:39:21,319 --> 01:39:26,659
cannabis that's grown well that's their

2636
01:39:23,479 --> 01:39:28,309
prerogative and if I mean you know it's

2637
01:39:26,659 --> 01:39:31,039
more I think a personal preference I

2638
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:33,830
think that cannabis as a plant enjoys

2639
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:35,989
being in the soil where it's always been

2640
01:39:33,829 --> 01:39:37,930
but I mean I'm not gonna pass any

2641
01:39:35,989 --> 01:39:39,739
judgment and people do amazing jobs

2642
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:41,780
growing you know and if they're

2643
01:39:39,739 --> 01:39:43,340
passionate about it and if they don't

2644
01:39:41,779 --> 01:39:46,099
use a lot of garbage and they use pure

2645
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:48,199
salts they don't use any crazy chemical

2646
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:52,130
additives or pesticides fungicides I

2647
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:52,829
think it's probably okay and so do you

2648
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:55,980
find the

2649
01:39:52,829 --> 01:39:58,289
being organic yourself that makes the

2650
01:39:55,979 --> 01:39:59,429
maintenance of your mother garden or

2651
01:39:58,289 --> 01:40:01,229
just your general garden for example

2652
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:02,940
more easier because this is something

2653
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:04,589
I'm constantly telling people is that

2654
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:06,029
it's really easy to look after mother

2655
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:08,730
plants in organics you know do you agree

2656
01:40:06,029 --> 01:40:10,529
with that yeah I mean yeah I mean if

2657
01:40:08,729 --> 01:40:11,209
you're not like pulling clones off of

2658
01:40:10,529 --> 01:40:13,559
them

2659
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:15,720
relentlessly I think yeah I think it's

2660
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,370
super easy put it in dirt you use PETA

2661
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,530
you can even just like I'm pretty like

2662
01:40:17,369 --> 01:40:21,210
MacGyver like ghetto style organic

2663
01:40:19,529 --> 01:40:24,779
gardener like I don't have time to be

2664
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:26,520
brewing seed teas and doing ferments and

2665
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:28,229
all these amazing things that people are

2666
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,820
just going for which I find fascinating

2667
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:31,259
I think I love all these people doing

2668
01:40:29,819 --> 01:40:32,909
these crazy things but I don't have the

2669
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:35,489
time I would love to be sprout and see

2670
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:38,519
teas and so I pretty much just throw it

2671
01:40:35,489 --> 01:40:41,099
in in some good rich potting soil and

2672
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,660
top dress with organic amendments may

2673
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,880
make some teas here and there use a few

2674
01:40:42,659 --> 01:40:46,260
different things but I go for ease

2675
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,730
because I don't have a lot of time I'm

2676
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:49,409
just trying to keep everything alive I

2677
01:40:47,729 --> 01:40:51,659
have you know hundreds of different

2678
01:40:49,409 --> 01:40:54,420
strain mother plants that you know that

2679
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:56,279
I kind of it's like my crayon box and do

2680
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:59,430
my hardest to keep them alive but you

2681
01:40:56,279 --> 01:41:01,229
know if a kid gets sick or I leave on an

2682
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:04,050
adventure and someone doesn't water like

2683
01:41:01,229 --> 01:41:06,149
you lose stuff and that's it's sad and

2684
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:07,770
definitely soils probably I think it's

2685
01:41:06,149 --> 01:41:09,839
the most friendly I mean I know people

2686
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:11,160
have systems dialed in where they can

2687
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,230
look on their cell phone and change

2688
01:41:11,159 --> 01:41:15,090
things and they get there's a camera and

2689
01:41:13,229 --> 01:41:16,919
you know our friends are like oh I could

2690
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:19,199
leave for two weeks of my hydro system

2691
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:21,090
and go to Hawaii and it's I mean maybe

2692
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:24,500
there's if you're like Brainiac and

2693
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:28,890
you're in your super good at I mean if

2694
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:31,560
conceivably the stint route could be

2695
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:32,820
better but for ease and just throwing it

2696
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:35,580
right in there and just giving it what

2697
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:37,439
it wants its I think dirt is the best or

2698
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:39,409
you know even cocoa is so hard to deal

2699
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:42,139
with because it dries out so fast and I

2700
01:41:39,409 --> 01:41:46,500
think God made dirt and dirt don't hurt

2701
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:49,350
I like that I mean kind of expanding on

2702
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:51,899
that point your library I imagine that

2703
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:54,270
it must contain the biggest differential

2704
01:41:51,899 --> 01:41:55,409
of growth between plants in anyone's

2705
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:57,270
library you know you must have some

2706
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:58,439
plants that grow three or four times as

2707
01:41:57,270 --> 01:42:00,720
quickly as others you know probably

2708
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:02,699
sativa type ones do you find that you're

2709
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:04,739
constantly having to kind of wrangle

2710
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:06,510
these land races

2711
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:09,389
compared to you know your other strains

2712
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:11,190
which may be a bit more tamed yeah I

2713
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:13,200
mean a lot of my it's funny Nick

2714
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:15,539
the strange thing is a lot of my time I

2715
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:16,979
actually goes to cloning I make every

2716
01:42:15,539 --> 01:42:18,930
week I'm climbing cuz I don't want to

2717
01:42:16,979 --> 01:42:21,169
lose something or things get too tall

2718
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:23,640
anytime I cut tops off things I'm always

2719
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:26,670
cloning cuz you know something can

2720
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:28,710
happen or I don't have backups or you

2721
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:30,930
know and you know in my mom and dad

2722
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:33,029
rooms I have a couple and you know I'm

2723
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:34,650
pretty loose I have the males and the

2724
01:42:33,029 --> 01:42:37,079
females and the team isn't in because I

2725
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:39,029
try and kind of put the indicas on the

2726
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:41,609
front row the sativa is in the back but

2727
01:42:39,029 --> 01:42:43,979
things do get crazy and they go in there

2728
01:42:41,609 --> 01:42:45,479
you know and they all need you know I

2729
01:42:43,979 --> 01:42:48,119
haven't pretty dialed where everybody

2730
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:50,729
gets along and I don't feed too heavy so

2731
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:52,619
everything kind of stays the way it

2732
01:42:50,729 --> 01:42:54,750
should but it's hard to keep a library

2733
01:42:52,619 --> 01:42:56,760
like it Encyclopedia Brittanica of

2734
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:58,710
strains you know it's super easy to lose

2735
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,600
things and if you're not on it you can

2736
01:42:58,710 --> 01:43:03,390
get bugs and things are always growing

2737
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:06,420
too fast and you have to repot like it's

2738
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:07,770
it's hard to I mean I I wonder how those

2739
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,090
Botanical Gardens keep everything

2740
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:13,110
together I guess they have a whole team

2741
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:15,810
but it's not easy to keep a library yeah

2742
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:19,409
I can relate and I'm sure mine's nothing

2743
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:21,600
compared to the size of yours yes my

2744
01:43:19,409 --> 01:43:23,699
question was on top of having a big

2745
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,469
library you also seem to be at least

2746
01:43:23,699 --> 01:43:27,569
from what I can see the breeder who

2747
01:43:25,469 --> 01:43:29,369
releases the most of their personal

2748
01:43:27,569 --> 01:43:30,689
cards was this something you

2749
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:32,399
intentionally wanted to do or just

2750
01:43:30,689 --> 01:43:34,109
something which kind of happened through

2751
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:36,809
you know just kind of generosity I guess

2752
01:43:34,109 --> 01:43:38,819
I mean I always like to give them to

2753
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:41,130
friends and stuff but you know recently

2754
01:43:38,819 --> 01:43:42,719
it was weird because I you know I have

2755
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:45,420
some people saying oh you should keep

2756
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,819
your really special ones maybe you could

2757
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:50,340
you know trademark rmr sell them to uh

2758
01:43:47,819 --> 01:43:52,469
in the future to a place you know - like

2759
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:54,090
when Starbucks has their cannabis

2760
01:43:52,469 --> 01:43:57,270
division their special strain and you

2761
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:59,340
know like but for me it's like the way

2762
01:43:57,270 --> 01:44:01,410
things are going like I love to see

2763
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:03,210
whatever he's doing in there everybody

2764
01:44:01,409 --> 01:44:06,630
seems to be kind of focusing on the you

2765
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:07,920
know cookie Kim sour gas thing there's a

2766
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:09,810
lot of amazing things that are coming

2767
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,560
out with that but I wanted people to

2768
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:15,030
kind of experience other other plants

2769
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:16,530
and a lot of people go from clones and I

2770
01:44:15,029 --> 01:44:18,479
thought you know what's the what better

2771
01:44:16,529 --> 01:44:22,079
way to not only

2772
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:23,129
you know help get people understanding

2773
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:25,019
chemists from a completely different

2774
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:26,369
thing is to give out some special stuff

2775
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:28,410
that maybe is different from other

2776
01:44:26,369 --> 01:44:30,960
things and that people can riff off of

2777
01:44:28,409 --> 01:44:32,550
our experience are like oh wow I didn't

2778
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,560
know I could do this or wow this is that

2779
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:36,779
or oh here's a stiva that's has a great

2780
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:38,700
high but maybe it's quicker and for me I

2781
01:44:36,779 --> 01:44:40,559
was I saw everybody hoarding and I was

2782
01:44:38,699 --> 01:44:42,090
like you know I think I'm just gonna do

2783
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,470
the opposite of or I'm just gonna start

2784
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:46,529
giving all the way all the cool stuff

2785
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:48,390
because you know you can always make new

2786
01:44:46,529 --> 01:44:49,920
stuff you especially if you know a good

2787
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:51,239
seed collection you can always create

2788
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,829
new stuff and that's the funny thing

2789
01:44:51,238 --> 01:44:53,488
about elites it's like they are all came

2790
01:44:52,829 --> 01:44:55,699
from seeds

2791
01:44:53,488 --> 01:44:58,199
it's funny how every chases these elites

2792
01:44:55,699 --> 01:44:59,880
but really you could find all these

2793
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:01,409
things they're everywhere and this is if

2794
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:04,319
you just have the time and you and

2795
01:45:01,409 --> 01:45:06,479
you're in the kenai and the passion you

2796
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:08,460
can pretty much pull anything out of

2797
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:10,649
your head and it's I think it's fun to

2798
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:12,840
let to share and let people check out

2799
01:45:10,649 --> 01:45:14,699
new things and experience stuff so I

2800
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:17,069
think I'm just trying to foster like

2801
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:19,289
kind of an environment of giving and

2802
01:45:17,069 --> 01:45:22,559
caring and exploration and kind of like

2803
01:45:19,289 --> 01:45:24,659
sharing our buddy strife Fox had a

2804
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,430
question relating to that is radio nurse

2805
01:45:24,659 --> 01:45:28,800
are you gonna be your main spot to kind

2806
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:29,789
of release your cuts in the future well

2807
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:32,310
you know it's funny he's like I've

2808
01:45:29,789 --> 01:45:34,109
always liked you know a few times I've

2809
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:35,850
kind of taken my trays down and tried to

2810
01:45:34,109 --> 01:45:37,799
give them out but I don't have time to

2811
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:39,480
make trays and my mom room really isn't

2812
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:41,250
the cleanest place you know I'm always

2813
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:43,349
battling some foreign invader that's

2814
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:46,439
slipping in from our organic garden so I

2815
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:48,000
[ __ ] her like a dork trying to bring in

2816
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:49,500
trays because you know you know

2817
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,720
sometimes like at p.m. sometimes have

2818
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:54,000
bugs I don't want to do that so I never

2819
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:58,199
found I always wanted to give it to like

2820
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,670
a local stream place and no one ever you

2821
01:45:58,199 --> 01:46:01,380
know ever everything kind of fell

2822
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:03,659
through and then I met the radio rich

2823
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:04,680
people and they have really good hearts

2824
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:07,590
and I really like I mean it's a

2825
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:09,690
male/female combo and they do a really

2826
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:12,840
amazing job and I'm like yeah I would

2827
01:46:09,689 --> 01:46:14,669
this is a great outlet so yeah um they

2828
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,289
have a bunch of my stuff and they're the

2829
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:18,149
mostly putting it out in this area I'd

2830
01:46:16,289 --> 01:46:19,619
love to see people grab those clones and

2831
01:46:18,149 --> 01:46:20,939
take them other places and get them out

2832
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:22,949
I love to see him go all over the world

2833
01:46:20,939 --> 01:46:24,929
and pretty soon there'll be some

2834
01:46:22,949 --> 01:46:27,210
supernatural selections cuts going out

2835
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:30,659
and then just some more stuff and some

2836
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:32,279
of you know landrace maybe some landrace

2837
01:46:30,659 --> 01:46:33,840
but you know people don't

2838
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:35,759
really jive with it so much I kind of

2839
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,319
just leave that to friends but a lot of

2840
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,770
the new super natural selection stuff is

2841
01:46:37,319 --> 01:46:43,199
indoor friendly and it's definitely

2842
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:44,910
sativa indica hybrids but they you know

2843
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,229
they have a nominal flowering time and

2844
01:46:44,909 --> 01:46:48,149
they still keep their unique character

2845
01:46:46,229 --> 01:46:50,399
and they're usually friendly inside so I

2846
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:52,769
just want people that it's really get

2847
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:56,039
get exposed to new things and really get

2848
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:58,350
passionate about the total spectrum yes

2849
01:46:56,039 --> 01:46:59,939
I mean with that kind of point in mind

2850
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:03,360
would you be able to tell us some more

2851
01:46:59,939 --> 01:47:05,579
stuff about the Dredd bread and the oMG

2852
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:07,019
that goes into that one because I've got

2853
01:47:05,579 --> 01:47:09,090
a friend who's grown out some hybrids of

2854
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,770
that and we couldn't find a ton of

2855
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:12,539
information on it but we could see that

2856
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:14,940
it was of landrace origins so we got

2857
01:47:12,539 --> 01:47:16,289
excited at that but again yeah it'd be

2858
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:18,449
cool to know more about that one thing

2859
01:47:16,289 --> 01:47:21,060
as it is popping up a lot in the tester

2860
01:47:18,449 --> 01:47:23,189
lines at the moment oh yeah yeah and

2861
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,750
that was just kind of like a male and I

2862
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:25,919
was like I found a good male that kind

2863
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:27,329
of matched my favorite female as like

2864
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,340
I'll just try it on some of my outdoor

2865
01:47:27,329 --> 01:47:30,809
stuff we gathered up from some seeds

2866
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:33,119
from home some of my land rights outside

2867
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:35,730
but the drug bread is kind of like the

2868
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:39,300
first release of super national

2869
01:47:35,729 --> 01:47:41,849
selections and it's your basic f1 hybrid

2870
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:45,029
between an Afghani and a Colombian so

2871
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:47,760
it's mango BJ and this was like seeds

2872
01:47:45,029 --> 01:47:50,189
that I got from a friend who's in

2873
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:52,530
Ecuador Colombia I mean mango be

2874
01:47:50,189 --> 01:47:54,839
Chicanos like the Blue Dream of South

2875
01:47:52,529 --> 01:47:57,269
America in a way it seems like everybody

2876
01:47:54,840 --> 01:48:00,150
grows it everybody loves it it does well

2877
01:47:57,270 --> 01:48:01,440
in their environment and it yeah so who

2878
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:02,579
knows if it's really an heirloom or

2879
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:05,489
landrace it's been around long enough

2880
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:06,930
that you would it seems to be some kind

2881
01:48:05,489 --> 01:48:08,429
of land race or land race hybrid that's

2882
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:12,060
turned into an heirloom and it does

2883
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:15,810
really well and it for most of South

2884
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:18,570
America so I got some seeds and grew out

2885
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:21,000
the mega BJ and I found one one that was

2886
01:48:18,569 --> 01:48:23,279
really really turf rich and really

2887
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,470
special and really easy to grow and it

2888
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:28,670
was pretty quick for a mango VJ so I

2889
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:31,289
kept that and then I have this old

2890
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:33,600
Afghani line that I got seeds from a

2891
01:48:31,289 --> 01:48:36,029
long time ago and it was just they were

2892
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,430
just it was just called old Afghani or

2893
01:48:36,029 --> 01:48:40,170
vintage Afghani then I popped those many

2894
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:43,289
years ago and I got this really

2895
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:46,020
beautiful Afghani expression kind of

2896
01:48:43,289 --> 01:48:47,909
like it almost seems like it it

2897
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:51,210
be a land racer even maybe one of the

2898
01:48:47,909 --> 01:48:53,159
really early Dutch afghani scuzz it it's

2899
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:55,980
so resonance and nice and it has this

2900
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:57,899
kind of like floral all citrus thing -

2901
01:48:55,979 --> 01:48:59,069
it's kind of like through a while there

2902
01:48:57,899 --> 01:49:00,839
was these Afghan ease that came out that

2903
01:48:59,069 --> 01:49:03,479
we're kind of more on the citrus and you

2904
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:05,610
know it seemed like true time different

2905
01:49:03,479 --> 01:49:09,029
varieties of Afghani have popped up from

2906
01:49:05,609 --> 01:49:11,579
the acrid to the like more very smelling

2907
01:49:09,029 --> 01:49:13,949
- like the bready to the even to the

2908
01:49:11,579 --> 01:49:15,809
roadkill II there's all these different

2909
01:49:13,949 --> 01:49:17,130
expressions and this seemed to be one I

2910
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:18,420
would kind of have to pick it like in

2911
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:21,000
the maybe that ease or something where

2912
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:25,890
it's this highly resonance beautiful

2913
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:28,770
quick very full resinous males just as

2914
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:31,289
perfect breeding Afghani for like a

2915
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:35,040
modern kind of mindset so taking that

2916
01:49:31,289 --> 01:49:36,119
mango Beach a-gonna sativa trippy rich

2917
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:40,649
thing and putting it with that really

2918
01:49:36,119 --> 01:49:43,470
nice chubby rich Afghani I got this

2919
01:49:40,649 --> 01:49:44,909
really cool it's really cool hybrid and

2920
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:46,590
so it kind of kind of started that as

2921
01:49:44,909 --> 01:49:48,479
saying like okay this is gonna be the

2922
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:51,960
first super natural selections and the

2923
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:54,389
funny thing is I just got we're just

2924
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:57,960
starting to pack up the seeds of the new

2925
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:59,640
run of the us dread bread so people

2926
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:02,220
should be able to get those in a couple

2927
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:03,720
weeks like then it might give away a

2928
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:05,730
bunch too so people can kind of really

2929
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:08,100
experience and get them excited about

2930
01:50:05,729 --> 01:50:09,509
these new kind of unique iPhones and get

2931
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:11,670
him excited about people using them in

2932
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:13,650
their programs and FM and finding stuff

2933
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:16,680
and just try and just try and like

2934
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:19,889
really open up that mandala of smells

2935
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:21,020
and effects and things just get I don't

2936
01:50:19,890 --> 01:50:25,250
know I just want people to get

2937
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:27,660
passionate and exposed to to the full

2938
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:29,670
extreme possibilities that cannabis has

2939
01:50:27,659 --> 01:50:31,409
to offer and from there people to really

2940
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:33,930
find what they like and really get into

2941
01:50:31,409 --> 01:50:35,519
their niche like that's what I find hard

2942
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:37,740
with today's breeding kind of modality

2943
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,720
is there's a few people that are really

2944
01:50:37,739 --> 01:50:41,219
finding their niche and enjoy driving

2945
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:43,380
with it and those are the people that I

2946
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:45,090
really like like you know I did I never

2947
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:47,460
really had a thing for autos I was like

2948
01:50:45,090 --> 01:50:49,590
oh they make good house plants that are

2949
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:51,149
you know great for Grandma and then you

2950
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:52,140
know there's people these days that it's

2951
01:50:51,149 --> 01:50:54,750
fine like mefisto

2952
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:56,340
like he found his niche like I'm not

2953
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:58,279
gonna ottoman I've seen what he's doing

2954
01:50:56,340 --> 01:51:00,650
I'm like wow you with your fashion

2955
01:50:58,279 --> 01:51:02,869
and you're really going deep you're

2956
01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:05,239
making amazing things and I think people

2957
01:51:02,869 --> 01:51:06,920
are you know there's some some of my

2958
01:51:05,239 --> 01:51:09,529
friends that are doing that too you know

2959
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:12,260
like Doc tea and stray Fox and snow high

2960
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:13,969
and coastal seeds and Sam and all these

2961
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:16,789
people they're finding their niche and

2962
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:18,650
whether it's the land races or some

2963
01:51:16,789 --> 01:51:20,720
people just like even if you're in super

2964
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:20,929
no G psyche take that thing and run with

2965
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:23,990
it

2966
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:26,240
or people doing it selfing s ones in

2967
01:51:23,989 --> 01:51:28,579
instead of just bashing up s1 hybrids

2968
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:31,819
really go deep start doing s 2 s 3 s

2969
01:51:28,579 --> 01:51:34,069
like do some weird stuff just get into

2970
01:51:31,819 --> 01:51:36,289
it and really explore and find what you

2971
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:38,539
like and just move forward with it and I

2972
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:40,579
think that's that's kind of my whole

2973
01:51:38,539 --> 01:51:42,560
thing right now is to really it's kind

2974
01:51:40,579 --> 01:51:44,600
of like the antidote for what the tidal

2975
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:47,060
wave of homogeny that's like coming and

2976
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:49,370
I'm hoping that if we can just light up

2977
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:52,220
on the left minds and hearts and palates

2978
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:54,529
that we can kind of like reverse this

2979
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:56,329
tide of like oh cool it's almost like a

2980
01:51:54,529 --> 01:51:58,849
global warming of cannabis you know it's

2981
01:51:56,329 --> 01:52:01,699
it's coming and if we can turn things

2982
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:05,150
around we we can really create something

2983
01:52:01,699 --> 01:52:06,920
special well some answer because I love

2984
01:52:05,149 --> 01:52:08,479
misto as well and I actually had a

2985
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,220
question for you anyways have you ever

2986
01:52:08,479 --> 01:52:13,969
come across any really cool land race

2987
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:16,070
orders you know that's funny because I I

2988
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:18,320
kind of have and I've heard of some

2989
01:52:16,069 --> 01:52:20,469
stuff too you know there's things like

2990
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:24,019
Mighty Mite which is supposedly an old

2991
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:26,600
nepali indica I've never seen indicas in

2992
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:28,730
default so I find it a little hard but

2993
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:30,140
it's one of those ones it wasn't you

2994
01:52:28,729 --> 01:52:31,489
know maybe I had one or a list or

2995
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:32,840
something or me is about Auto but it was

2996
01:52:31,489 --> 01:52:36,590
one of those plants that was kind of

2997
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:39,650
like semi-auto and you know in Morocco a

2998
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:41,779
lot of their plants are kind of auto in

2999
01:52:39,649 --> 01:52:43,069
a way and I've have you know bred I've

3000
01:52:41,779 --> 01:52:44,359
worked with some Moroccan plants that

3001
01:52:43,069 --> 01:52:46,609
I've collected and I'm like oh wow I

3002
01:52:44,359 --> 01:52:49,119
could probably slip this in and I could

3003
01:52:46,609 --> 01:52:52,460
really kind of kick things into gear and

3004
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:56,090
but you know I realize it's not it's not

3005
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:57,529
really my thing and I'm like there's

3006
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:59,300
people that are way more passionate

3007
01:52:57,529 --> 01:53:01,069
about it in our way more knowledgeable

3008
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:03,949
about it and I respect and I'm just

3009
01:53:01,069 --> 01:53:05,719
letting them go for it I mean so yeah I

3010
01:53:03,949 --> 01:53:08,689
don't have any plans to really do autos

3011
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:11,289
or really do it but there are you know

3012
01:53:08,689 --> 01:53:13,839
besides rules there's some Afghani

3013
01:53:11,289 --> 01:53:16,869
like there's that Auto Afghani there are

3014
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,819
some plants just due to their geography

3015
01:53:16,869 --> 01:53:20,890
and due to their selection over time

3016
01:53:18,819 --> 01:53:22,479
have created some of these these

3017
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:24,789
tendencies where they grow when they hit

3018
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:27,699
a certain size or they grow it when they

3019
01:53:24,789 --> 01:53:29,800
hit a certain duration I mean it's out

3020
01:53:27,699 --> 01:53:34,179
there and but I think that the auto

3021
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:35,949
spectrum has been pretty dialed you know

3022
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:37,630
especially over in Spain there so Auto

3023
01:53:35,949 --> 01:53:38,949
it out and all the auto feminized now

3024
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:40,239
that they've kind of got it wired

3025
01:53:38,949 --> 01:53:42,069
they've got these genes kind of locked

3026
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:43,960
in for what they want to do especially

3027
01:53:42,069 --> 01:53:46,420
now in America with some of the a lot of

3028
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:49,480
people here I think it's kind of a done

3029
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:52,000
deal almost you know what I mean sure

3030
01:53:49,479 --> 01:53:54,250
and so just to loop back on another

3031
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,079
point you made earlier about s ones or

3032
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:57,729
feminized seeds how do you feel about

3033
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:59,559
them you know you've never done them

3034
01:53:57,729 --> 01:54:01,569
yourself is that because you're not

3035
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:07,330
interested or you don't feel they're as

3036
01:54:01,569 --> 01:54:09,519
good as regulars um you know I long time

3037
01:54:07,329 --> 01:54:11,619
ago I tried I got my STS and I did all

3038
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,820
that and it was just I just made a mess

3039
01:54:11,619 --> 01:54:14,019
out of everything else horrible I

3040
01:54:12,819 --> 01:54:16,509
couldn't gonna have to work on stomach

3041
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:18,190
it was just kind of more my whole thing

3042
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:21,039
on it was like I wanted to unlock the

3043
01:54:18,189 --> 01:54:23,589
gene pool if I could s1 or s2 you can

3044
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:25,869
really crack open a strain before we had

3045
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:27,489
like the whole genetic testing and we

3046
01:54:25,869 --> 01:54:28,750
you know you could really kind of see

3047
01:54:27,489 --> 01:54:31,029
what was in there you could see maybe

3048
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:32,319
it's parents it's grandparents you could

3049
01:54:31,029 --> 01:54:34,960
kind of you know that's the unique thing

3050
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:37,389
about selfing stuff is you could you can

3051
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,710
kind of see what's in there and some you

3052
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:41,850
know some of my friends that do a lot as

3053
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:44,140
s-1 work is they'll get you know forty

3054
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:45,340
plants that look exactly alike and then

3055
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:47,050
they'll get five that are like

3056
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:48,850
completely different so it was this like

3057
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:50,770
kind of something that was back in its

3058
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:54,579
history and it's a really unique tool

3059
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:56,620
but for me you know it's I know it does

3060
01:54:54,579 --> 01:54:59,769
happen in nature but for me I just I

3061
01:54:56,619 --> 01:55:02,949
don't know maybe it's just I like just

3062
01:54:59,770 --> 01:55:04,750
basic sexual breeding you know I just

3063
01:55:02,949 --> 01:55:06,309
like to bring males and females together

3064
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:08,800
and that's my jam that's my niche and

3065
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:11,140
that's kind of what I do you know I for

3066
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:15,699
a while I was kind of down on autos I

3067
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:17,710
mean I thought oh sorry boys fams

3068
01:55:15,699 --> 01:55:19,869
you know I didn't really understand it

3069
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:23,319
as much until I met people that really

3070
01:55:19,869 --> 01:55:24,880
just truly had away with it you know

3071
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:28,599
like inspector

3072
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:31,300
he does amazing autos are Illuminati you

3073
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:33,670
know incognito he does crazy I get

3074
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:36,369
autist Matt riot does amazing out of

3075
01:55:33,670 --> 01:55:39,640
some people have then they just have the

3076
01:55:36,369 --> 01:55:41,019
they have a gift and they have they know

3077
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:42,760
what they're doing and they push it in

3078
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:46,600
different directions I'm not a big fan

3079
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:47,949
of the taking like basically you're kind

3080
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,950
of flavor of the week taking an elite

3081
01:55:47,949 --> 01:55:52,389
Cologne and feminizing and spraying it

3082
01:55:50,949 --> 01:55:54,069
on everything sure there's gonna be

3083
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:57,280
unique things in that but it's kind of I

3084
01:55:54,069 --> 01:55:59,679
mean that's just really kind of a kind

3085
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:01,779
of a short-sighted shortcut it's easy I

3086
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:04,210
mean it is I guess I can't really pass

3087
01:56:01,779 --> 01:56:06,009
Church but it does it is cool but it's

3088
01:56:04,210 --> 01:56:08,020
kind of I call that kind of like your

3089
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:10,630
that's kind of like the kindergarten

3090
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:12,730
level of breeding because you get

3091
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:14,500
because you you know not and it not an

3092
01:56:12,729 --> 01:56:16,750
interrogatory sense I mean like as a kid

3093
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:18,729
like you're so excited you want to have

3094
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:20,350
fun you want it fast you want to see

3095
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:23,289
what this does what happens if you know

3096
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:25,539
I put this Lego on this like it's great

3097
01:56:23,289 --> 01:56:27,519
it served its purpose but I think it's I

3098
01:56:25,539 --> 01:56:29,500
think some of the deep magic comes from

3099
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:33,880
the real work that people put into stuff

3100
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:34,989
so I think something is you know I used

3101
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,640
to not think it was that great now

3102
01:56:34,989 --> 01:56:38,109
people have changed my mind people

3103
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:40,420
change my mind every day that's what I

3104
01:56:38,109 --> 01:56:41,710
love about this community is people when

3105
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:44,319
they're passionate and they find their

3106
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:46,510
niche they truly can create magic that

3107
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:49,599
hasn't happened before so I give them

3108
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:51,489
props to everyone that does that yeah

3109
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:53,050
it's interesting you can almost reminds

3110
01:56:51,489 --> 01:56:55,899
me of like a spray-and-pray

3111
01:56:53,050 --> 01:56:57,369
type of approach interesting you brought

3112
01:56:55,899 --> 01:56:59,289
up Matt you know we had Matt on the show

3113
01:56:57,369 --> 01:57:01,149
a little while ago I think what's most

3114
01:56:59,289 --> 01:57:02,739
interesting about your friendship with

3115
01:57:01,149 --> 01:57:04,569
him and what people seem to be

3116
01:57:02,739 --> 01:57:06,340
interested in at least is how kind of

3117
01:57:04,569 --> 01:57:08,079
polar opposite you guys are as people

3118
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:10,180
you know like how did you meet Matt and

3119
01:57:08,079 --> 01:57:12,640
do you find in general you're drawn

3120
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:15,159
towards people who are quite different

3121
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:17,500
to personality-wise or do you find your

3122
01:57:15,159 --> 01:57:20,559
more kind of likely to hang with someone

3123
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:22,510
who's more similar to you you know for

3124
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:25,780
friends it's I think more similar I've

3125
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:28,000
definitely met people online and

3126
01:57:25,779 --> 01:57:29,199
in-person that you know that we're much

3127
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,600
differently probably wouldn't be friends

3128
01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:34,420
if we didn't have can cannabis their

3129
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:37,090
lives to geek out on but really you know

3130
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:38,050
if people are if people are cool to me

3131
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:39,670
I'm called amide

3132
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:42,579
try and create an attitude I try and

3133
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:44,170
meet people at a basic human level you

3134
01:57:42,579 --> 01:57:46,149
know people don't rub me on the wrong

3135
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:48,579
way or they you know arrogant or this

3136
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:49,779
and that but if someone is is really

3137
01:57:48,579 --> 01:57:51,579
themselves they have a personality

3138
01:57:49,779 --> 01:57:54,000
they're even a character like I'll give

3139
01:57:51,579 --> 01:57:56,949
them the space to be who they are and

3140
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,960
format like you know I met back in kind

3141
01:57:56,949 --> 01:58:01,449
of the older forum days when it was more

3142
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:03,100
of a small community and he was doing

3143
01:58:01,449 --> 01:58:05,409
something really cool he was working you

3144
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:07,840
know he was he was trying to create a

3145
01:58:05,409 --> 01:58:08,949
medical Garden for patients and I think

3146
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:12,039
this is where he got a lot of the bad

3147
01:58:08,949 --> 01:58:13,869
rap is he was started to ask a lot of

3148
01:58:12,039 --> 01:58:15,659
readers for seeds cuz he wanted to do a

3149
01:58:13,869 --> 01:58:17,979
lot of different stuff for this this

3150
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:19,720
medical garden that he was part of and

3151
01:58:17,979 --> 01:58:21,489
it you know was very altruistic and I

3152
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:24,930
was like sure and a lot of people said

3153
01:58:21,489 --> 01:58:29,019
sure and I guess it all fell through and

3154
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:30,670
and it didn't happen and he still had

3155
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:33,670
the seeds but that's okay people give

3156
01:58:30,670 --> 01:58:37,690
seeds altruistically and I think they

3157
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:39,310
may later on maybe he was you know there

3158
01:58:37,689 --> 01:58:40,659
was an auction and maybe one or two of

3159
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:42,070
those seed packs came up and that's like

3160
01:58:40,659 --> 01:58:43,569
watching your people see it's like who

3161
01:58:42,069 --> 01:58:46,479
cares what they do with them and I think

3162
01:58:43,569 --> 01:58:48,250
people got uptight and they you know and

3163
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:50,019
then all these rumors started and then

3164
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:51,550
as people come on later in life they

3165
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:53,440
don't really go back and look at the

3166
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:54,820
actual information they just hear the

3167
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:57,489
rumors and take him for a Point Blank

3168
01:58:54,819 --> 01:59:00,279
and I know that he rubs people the wrong

3169
01:58:57,489 --> 01:59:01,750
way but he that's his service I think in

3170
01:59:00,279 --> 01:59:03,519
Arkansas community where there's many

3171
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:06,430
characters and there's many people that

3172
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:08,440
have vital positions and his service is

3173
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:11,950
to call people out and not taking EBS

3174
01:59:08,439 --> 01:59:14,559
and to be a bunker and [ __ ] [ __ ] and I

3175
01:59:11,949 --> 01:59:16,539
you know I I think if we have a place

3176
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,400
for everybody and I know people some

3177
01:59:16,539 --> 01:59:20,590
people hate him some people love he's a

3178
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:23,649
great guy we share a lot of stuff on

3179
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:26,140
music and he's got a kind heart but he

3180
01:59:23,649 --> 01:59:28,329
doesn't take any BS and I kind of like

3181
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:30,280
him for that and I like him for that he

3182
01:59:28,329 --> 01:59:33,100
he doesn't take a lot of flack and he

3183
01:59:30,279 --> 01:59:34,750
almost you know I he's almost like a

3184
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:38,380
punching bag a lot it I think a lot of

3185
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:41,079
people are spared because he takes a lot

3186
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:44,409
of the hits and I think that he's vital

3187
01:59:41,079 --> 01:59:46,510
in a way to keeping everything fresh and

3188
01:59:44,409 --> 01:59:48,309
fluid I think everybody plays a pardon

3189
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:50,440
if everybody comes you know if

3190
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:51,389
everybody's communicating from their

3191
01:59:50,439 --> 01:59:53,549
mind in their heart

3192
01:59:51,389 --> 01:59:56,100
there's room for everybody and I like

3193
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:57,929
that I think he's a cool guy and I would

3194
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:59,369
get along great and there's a there's a

3195
01:59:57,929 --> 02:00:01,158
lot of characters like that in the can

3196
01:59:59,368 --> 02:00:03,179
in this world that are kind of where our

3197
02:00:01,158 --> 02:00:05,670
personalities are kind of a lot

3198
02:00:03,179 --> 02:00:08,310
different but we share a passion for

3199
02:00:05,670 --> 02:00:10,649
things and I think that's in any

3200
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:11,850
community so yeah I cherish those kind

3201
02:00:10,649 --> 02:00:13,319
of characters and people in our

3202
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:16,619
community they're a lot different that

3203
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:18,569
are kind of pushing things just add to

3204
02:00:16,618 --> 02:00:22,198
that we also love Matt and ease take no

3205
02:00:18,569 --> 02:00:25,079
[ __ ] attitude so just on a bit of a

3206
02:00:22,198 --> 02:00:26,879
different topic when is a project done

3207
02:00:25,079 --> 02:00:28,889
for you you know I use someone who sets

3208
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:30,389
deadlines on things do you think well if

3209
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:32,730
it's not working by this point I'm gonna

3210
02:00:30,389 --> 02:00:34,020
move on or do you kind of go by feel and

3211
02:00:32,729 --> 02:00:37,529
you think now I'm gonna stick with it

3212
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:40,290
till it feels like it's done you know

3213
02:00:37,529 --> 02:00:43,738
for me I have lots of projects like I do

3214
02:00:40,289 --> 02:00:45,210
a lot of grid work and then for my kind

3215
02:00:43,738 --> 02:00:46,919
of personal projects where I'm doing you

3216
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:49,469
know people don't think I really line

3217
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:51,029
read that much but I have a lot of

3218
02:00:49,469 --> 02:00:53,069
different things I've lined bread I just

3219
02:00:51,029 --> 02:00:55,679
kind of keep them more for myself as my

3220
02:00:53,069 --> 02:00:57,059
own breeding tools or to make them more

3221
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:59,279
inbred so they can use them with other

3222
02:00:57,060 --> 02:01:00,960
inbred things I don't really release so

3223
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:02,789
much library stuff because I really it's

3224
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:05,880
my personal work that I make kind of for

3225
02:01:02,789 --> 02:01:08,819
myself or for my toolbox and you know

3226
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:12,060
recently I kind of got some flack online

3227
02:01:08,819 --> 02:01:14,039
and I realized okay so you know I hear

3228
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:16,230
what people saying and and I get it and

3229
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:18,118
and so now I'm kind of like oh I'm gonna

3230
02:01:16,229 --> 02:01:19,669
start you I'm gonna start letting out

3231
02:01:18,118 --> 02:01:23,309
some of my line work you know I have a

3232
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:25,618
my purple unicorn lion is like it f4 and

3233
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:27,510
I think my dragon's blood is it the five

3234
02:01:25,618 --> 02:01:28,920
or six and I have you know have some

3235
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:30,510
Lucky Charms I have a lot of my strains

3236
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:32,699
I'm bred out and I think you know

3237
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:35,010
especially as things go extinct

3238
02:01:32,698 --> 02:01:37,710
I might start releasing some of my line

3239
02:01:35,010 --> 02:01:42,239
bred stuff my whole theory was that I

3240
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:44,310
like to people to buy f1 hybrids to get

3241
02:01:42,238 --> 02:01:46,439
something special and then if they want

3242
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:48,150
to go deeper in spawn they can do f2 s

3243
02:01:46,439 --> 02:01:49,919
and they can find things that look like

3244
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:51,479
just like the parents and they can

3245
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:53,699
really pick out what they like not what

3246
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:55,468
I like like I'm not trying to tell you

3247
02:01:53,698 --> 02:01:58,559
what school I'm trying to give you a

3248
02:01:55,469 --> 02:02:00,239
maximum gene pool to work with so you

3249
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,099
can really find what you like and that

3250
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:04,828
was my whole thing but now I'm finding

3251
02:02:02,099 --> 02:02:06,900
that people kind of do want to know what

3252
02:02:04,828 --> 02:02:08,698
kind of iLike and what I'm pushing

3253
02:02:06,899 --> 02:02:11,399
things too so I'm gonna release some of

3254
02:02:08,698 --> 02:02:13,469
my kind of like my more worked lines and

3255
02:02:11,399 --> 02:02:14,698
out there so that makes people having a

3256
02:02:13,469 --> 02:02:18,599
hope that they can use them in their own

3257
02:02:14,698 --> 02:02:21,089
programs so with that in mind do you

3258
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:23,039
have a preferred type of project like do

3259
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:25,199
you find that f ones bring you the most

3260
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:27,359
kind of happiness or do you like to lime

3261
02:02:25,198 --> 02:02:29,129
breed but you know you just don't see it

3262
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:31,348
as necessarily fit for public release

3263
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:33,960
like what how would you rank things in

3264
02:02:31,349 --> 02:02:35,699
terms of you know F ones live readings

3265
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:40,380
I guess family be at the bottom by

3266
02:02:35,698 --> 02:02:43,888
definition you know I personally like F

3267
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:45,510
ones it goes it there's something magic

3268
02:02:43,889 --> 02:02:47,730
about two things meeting for the first

3269
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:51,599
time there's this you know and even even

3270
02:02:47,729 --> 02:02:54,569
nature congratulate a true f1 in hybrid

3271
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:56,039
vigor like in people to if you have like

3272
02:02:54,569 --> 02:02:58,229
you know when the French colonized

3273
02:02:56,039 --> 02:03:00,988
Vietnam you get these combinations like

3274
02:02:58,229 --> 02:03:03,238
look at women women are amazing aren't

3275
02:03:00,988 --> 02:03:05,029
they the most beautiful lines I like

3276
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:07,558
these they were like these walking

3277
02:03:05,029 --> 02:03:11,460
biological flowers and if you take and

3278
02:03:07,559 --> 02:03:14,309
say you're Vietnamese man and a French

3279
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:16,590
woman you know in Vietnam they breed

3280
02:03:14,309 --> 02:03:18,480
increase these amazing special things

3281
02:03:16,590 --> 02:03:20,489
and I love that and that's why I like

3282
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:23,250
and even my you know my philosophical

3283
02:03:20,488 --> 02:03:26,098
and my religious beliefs are based in

3284
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:28,679
this kind of combination of energy and

3285
02:03:26,099 --> 02:03:30,659
awareness or basically male and female

3286
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:31,889
these polarities and I love when these

3287
02:03:30,658 --> 02:03:34,138
things come together and that's kind of

3288
02:03:31,889 --> 02:03:35,760
what I like to give out and then you

3289
02:03:34,139 --> 02:03:37,710
know all these other projects like I've

3290
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:39,420
had a roadkill skunk project going for

3291
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:41,789
years and years and years I just pit all

3292
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:43,139
the way out in and I you know I do so

3293
02:03:41,789 --> 02:03:45,149
much work behind the scenes with all

3294
02:03:43,139 --> 02:03:47,699
these different kind of projects I do

3295
02:03:45,149 --> 02:03:50,399
have a lot of weird projects purple

3296
02:03:47,698 --> 02:03:53,479
projects and landrace projects and I do

3297
02:03:50,399 --> 02:03:55,439
a lot of I do a lot of line bringing

3298
02:03:53,479 --> 02:03:59,819
primarily it's just really for myself

3299
02:03:55,439 --> 02:04:02,189
and really for making my mic toolkit a

3300
02:03:59,819 --> 02:04:04,078
lot easier to deal with you know I'm a

3301
02:04:02,189 --> 02:04:08,009
really big proponent of making your own

3302
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:11,189
tools and making your own things to work

3303
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:13,230
with you know I think that's is as we

3304
02:04:11,189 --> 02:04:16,078
get more proficient in cannabis breeding

3305
02:04:13,229 --> 02:04:18,509
and combining we can really do things

3306
02:04:16,078 --> 02:04:21,179
that people never really even matter

3307
02:04:18,510 --> 02:04:22,980
you can do so for me I'd like to keep a

3308
02:04:21,179 --> 02:04:25,980
lot of personal projects always open

3309
02:04:22,979 --> 02:04:28,439
they could take years even short-term

3310
02:04:25,979 --> 02:04:30,629
little fun things but a majority of my

3311
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:32,578
stuff does tend to be and then it's just

3312
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:34,500
in those f1 hybrids and that's kind of

3313
02:04:32,578 --> 02:04:37,828
what the market wants like if I just did

3314
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:40,078
we finally did Marika I would be leaving

3315
02:04:37,828 --> 02:04:42,389
out a cardboard box like you know I mean

3316
02:04:40,078 --> 02:04:44,729
what sells is the is these is the

3317
02:04:42,389 --> 02:04:46,590
mashups like the special mail and elite

3318
02:04:44,729 --> 02:04:49,169
mashups everybody wants the new best

3319
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:50,639
thing they want the chirp every new

3320
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:54,179
flavours and you know and I try and

3321
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:55,409
develop my my special mails as I you

3322
02:04:54,179 --> 02:04:57,690
know I try and think of ahead a little

3323
02:04:55,408 --> 02:04:59,399
bit and see where the markets going and

3324
02:04:57,689 --> 02:05:01,229
see what people are into and I kind of

3325
02:04:59,399 --> 02:05:03,328
face my new mails on that and then I

3326
02:05:01,229 --> 02:05:05,578
release things and you know people say I

3327
02:05:03,328 --> 02:05:07,198
release a lot of stuff and I do because

3328
02:05:05,578 --> 02:05:08,729
I made our hell of a lot of students

3329
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:10,919
I've been doing this for a long time and

3330
02:05:08,729 --> 02:05:12,979
I make big runs of seeds and I keep them

3331
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:16,130
in the fridge i vacuum seal them and I

3332
02:05:12,979 --> 02:05:18,569
test them and sometimes I mean you know

3333
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:19,769
things I made six years ago are just now

3334
02:05:18,569 --> 02:05:21,268
seeing the face of they maybe they

3335
02:05:19,769 --> 02:05:22,920
didn't get tested right or someone

3336
02:05:21,269 --> 02:05:25,079
disappeared or I never got around to

3337
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:27,210
them and so when things good things come

3338
02:05:25,078 --> 02:05:29,939
about as when I usually release them and

3339
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:31,800
it seems to work and it gives the

3340
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:34,649
illusion of this massive workflow when

3341
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:40,860
really it's just this dance through time

3342
02:05:34,649 --> 02:05:45,569
and and selection that was my cat yeah

3343
02:05:40,859 --> 02:05:47,670
yeah so if we just jump into the idea of

3344
02:05:45,569 --> 02:05:49,558
lion breeding a little further I've had

3345
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:51,599
a few questions from people regarding

3346
02:05:49,559 --> 02:05:54,750
the sunshine daydream if it'll ever be

3347
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:57,150
done as a line as opposed to our crosses

3348
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:58,889
because obviously there's some hybrids

3349
02:05:57,149 --> 02:06:02,788
of it floating around at the moment we

3350
02:05:58,889 --> 02:06:06,599
ever consider F doing at f3 in it yeah

3351
02:06:02,788 --> 02:06:09,238
yeah you know I think I do I'm big

3352
02:06:06,599 --> 02:06:11,400
searching through lines in the summer

3353
02:06:09,238 --> 02:06:12,988
when I can have them outside and then

3354
02:06:11,399 --> 02:06:15,808
sometimes I'll bring them inside you do

3355
02:06:12,988 --> 02:06:18,299
like i'll utilize our outdoor season buy

3356
02:06:15,809 --> 02:06:19,650
into like threes on plant stuff early

3357
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:21,659
and when it gets mature I'll throw it in

3358
02:06:19,649 --> 02:06:23,129
my flower room and I'll kind of do that

3359
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:25,109
three times so I can really move through

3360
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:27,599
a lot of stuff and you know maybe next

3361
02:06:25,109 --> 02:06:29,339
year you know each year I pick I pick a

3362
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:31,050
couple of my lines and I really kind of

3363
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:31,470
look deep to see what's going on and

3364
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:36,510
this year

3365
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:38,579
was a I did a big dirty hippie seed pop

3366
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:41,250
which is basically you know I mean dirty

3367
02:06:38,579 --> 02:06:42,840
hippie f2 and then I also did a big

3368
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:44,699
tiger melon so those are kind of the two

3369
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,319
right now that I'm kind of going through

3370
02:06:44,699 --> 02:06:49,050
and seeing if I want to take it further

3371
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:52,679
and couldn't see what it opens up in the

3372
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:53,789
f2 so yeah I think any line that that is

3373
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:56,340
really special

3374
02:06:53,789 --> 02:06:58,019
I can always revisit it and I really do

3375
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:59,730
and that's definitely sunshine daydream

3376
02:06:58,020 --> 02:07:01,440
it is one that I really love and I would

3377
02:06:59,729 --> 02:07:03,419
love to just do it just so I can get

3378
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:05,519
another cup cut back because through

3379
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:07,440
time and space I've lost both of my

3380
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:09,150
favorite females so I'm kind of I don't

3381
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:12,629
even have any sunshine JJ man it is a

3382
02:07:09,149 --> 02:07:14,250
really special plan in how it works with

3383
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:18,239
the body and how it eases like the

3384
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:20,520
neurological pain that people have and a

3385
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:24,869
lot of it seemed it seems to be like one

3386
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:28,020
of my more medical orientated strains

3387
02:07:24,869 --> 02:07:29,460
even more so than like the good medicine

3388
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:31,860
or the barefoot doctor and some of those

3389
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:33,600
CBD rich ones like it is a really

3390
02:07:31,859 --> 02:07:36,359
special strand that's kind of why I

3391
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:37,590
retired that male I didn't go for it

3392
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:38,939
because it's like it's a strain where

3393
02:07:37,590 --> 02:07:40,650
it's like I don't think anything's

3394
02:07:38,939 --> 02:07:42,089
absolutely perfect but it's one of the

3395
02:07:40,649 --> 02:07:44,489
strains that kind of stands on its own

3396
02:07:42,090 --> 02:07:47,159
and it doesn't really need to be made to

3397
02:07:44,489 --> 02:07:49,380
be messed with and I kind of only hold

3398
02:07:47,159 --> 02:07:52,199
that sunshine day gmail back out again

3399
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:53,730
because through a mishap I lost the mail

3400
02:07:52,199 --> 02:07:55,409
that I was going to use on a pollination

3401
02:07:53,729 --> 02:07:57,869
and I was like well you know I have this

3402
02:07:55,409 --> 02:07:59,369
really old sunshine day tree mail that I

3403
02:07:57,869 --> 02:08:01,170
use a long time for the go for the

3404
02:07:59,369 --> 02:08:02,489
sunshine for and stuff I'm just gonna

3405
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:04,140
throw it in there you know it's a great

3406
02:08:02,489 --> 02:08:06,929
plant it should make some really fun

3407
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:08,670
stuff and that's how this kind of came

3408
02:08:06,930 --> 02:08:10,740
about and then I decided to kind of kill

3409
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:12,329
that mail so that those will be some

3410
02:08:10,739 --> 02:08:14,069
really special and people can kind of go

3411
02:08:12,329 --> 02:08:15,510
through them and that also too that it

3412
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:17,189
makes me want to go through more and

3413
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:18,480
really dig deeper into lines and I think

3414
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:20,879
that's really nice kind of like going

3415
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:23,189
it's kind of like you know visiting an

3416
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:24,900
old lover in a way you know it's like

3417
02:08:23,189 --> 02:08:26,699
there's a cherish then and you get to

3418
02:08:24,899 --> 02:08:28,500
come back and you know there's a

3419
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:29,970
familiarity you kind of know what you're

3420
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:33,149
looking for by the same time you're

3421
02:08:29,970 --> 02:08:35,640
excited and it feels so good and so do

3422
02:08:33,149 --> 02:08:37,529
you still have the Barbra Jean I don't

3423
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:39,570
know you know that's sad that's when I

3424
02:08:37,529 --> 02:08:41,130
lost and I lost the proper shine now and

3425
02:08:39,569 --> 02:08:43,259
the funny thing is the story about the

3426
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:44,659
Appalachia Mail would have never been

3427
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:46,460
used if I wouldn't have lost

3428
02:08:44,659 --> 02:08:47,750
buhbuh shine mail at the last second the

3429
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:50,750
bombs shine was gonna be the big

3430
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:55,250
pollinator that of all those hybrids

3431
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:58,189
that were the Appalachia so I just lost

3432
02:08:55,250 --> 02:09:00,229
the female to Dedinje which is a strange

3433
02:08:58,189 --> 02:09:02,269
thing that really drives me nuts that's

3434
02:09:00,229 --> 02:09:03,709
kind of affecting a lot of people that

3435
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:05,570
no one seems to really know what it is

3436
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:07,640
but I have made it quite a bit of

3437
02:09:05,569 --> 02:09:10,670
hybrids with it and I actually have a

3438
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:11,960
new male I'm kind of looking into right

3439
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:14,989
now I'm playing around with it's a

3440
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:17,480
bubble shine Instant Karma cross so

3441
02:09:14,989 --> 02:09:20,989
that's kind of my current bubble shine

3442
02:09:17,479 --> 02:09:24,649
kind of play around with kind of thing

3443
02:09:20,989 --> 02:09:27,380
I'm doing okay you mentioned your CBD

3444
02:09:24,649 --> 02:09:29,059
projects when if CBD kind of sit for you

3445
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:30,409
in the scheme of breeding you know I

3446
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:31,820
know that the CBD lines you have

3447
02:09:30,409 --> 02:09:34,250
released in the past were mostly

3448
02:09:31,819 --> 02:09:35,329
freebies and there's some information

3449
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:36,529
around them that you released you know

3450
02:09:35,329 --> 02:09:37,699
just kind of saying oh you know I had

3451
02:09:36,529 --> 02:09:40,550
these laying around I just wanted to get

3452
02:09:37,699 --> 02:09:42,019
him out to people do you plan to restock

3453
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:43,640
those or potentially work them further

3454
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:47,390
and the reason why I ask is is because I

3455
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:49,100
had a friend who had good medicine and

3456
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:52,100
he thought it was just like the best

3457
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:55,789
plan he'd ever had just even in you know

3458
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:57,500
a recreational sense sorry and um and he

3459
02:09:55,789 --> 02:09:59,029
was really bummed out he lost and I was

3460
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:02,000
like damn it'd be good to get some more

3461
02:09:59,029 --> 02:10:04,039
of those yeah I mean I go get you some

3462
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,159
ice I still have kind of all I think I

3463
02:10:04,039 --> 02:10:10,189
made like I think I liked a dozen CBD

3464
02:10:07,159 --> 02:10:12,079
maybe more maybe like 15 different CBD

3465
02:10:10,189 --> 02:10:14,179
hybrids you know originally it was more

3466
02:10:12,079 --> 02:10:15,649
two six exploring that medical side I

3467
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:17,329
was but when I first made the good

3468
02:10:15,649 --> 02:10:19,449
medicines it was back before everybody

3469
02:10:17,329 --> 02:10:22,640
was in-situ CBD there was only really

3470
02:10:19,449 --> 02:10:24,470
harlequin and then I don't know if ac/dc

3471
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:26,000
was in the state so much then and I was

3472
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:29,360
like you know I want to explore this I

3473
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,909
want it you know I my emphasis on really

3474
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:34,099
for me is like I love recreational I

3475
02:10:31,909 --> 02:10:35,809
love medical but really my thing is I

3476
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:38,510
want to create spirit nourishing strains

3477
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:40,880
like strains that awakened something

3478
02:10:38,510 --> 02:10:42,800
inside you that that's kind of either

3479
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:44,600
dormant or your that you're cultivating

3480
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,730
but for CBD I was so interested and that

3481
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:50,660
was right around the time that SC labs

3482
02:10:46,729 --> 02:10:52,279
opened in our and our in Santa Cruz kind

3483
02:10:50,659 --> 02:10:53,930
of where I live and I was like you know

3484
02:10:52,279 --> 02:10:56,389
what this is cool I'm gonna try this out

3485
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:57,340
I you know I took in my samples I took

3486
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:59,710
in my early leaf

3487
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:00,400
samples for my mails he was like six

3488
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:03,099
years ago

3489
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:05,019
five years ago found that and played

3490
02:11:03,099 --> 02:11:06,400
around and I was really excited to see

3491
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:07,980
Wow like it was just another one this

3492
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:10,179
thing's like what is gonna happen and

3493
02:11:07,979 --> 02:11:13,689
with the good medicine you know I found

3494
02:11:10,179 --> 02:11:15,760
a CBD rich male and I took it to the f2

3495
02:11:13,689 --> 02:11:18,098
and then I released those and then with

3496
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:19,420
that I I started pollinating a lot of

3497
02:11:18,099 --> 02:11:22,090
stuff with a good medicine a lot of the

3498
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:24,158
other CBD clones are coming out like the

3499
02:11:22,090 --> 02:11:25,510
aam Rita and the ac/dc and then even

3500
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:28,118
things like heroin and think special

3501
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:30,550
things I made a CBD og one that people

3502
02:11:28,118 --> 02:11:32,979
liked and then the the logical

3503
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:34,960
conclusion for like I really I was like

3504
02:11:32,979 --> 02:11:36,879
okay sunshine daydreams by like one of

3505
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:38,948
my favorite pain relieving strains what

3506
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:40,420
if I made a CBD rich sunshine a dream

3507
02:11:38,948 --> 02:11:42,579
and that's what kind of barefoot doctor

3508
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:44,949
is and that's kind of the one I think I

3509
02:11:42,579 --> 02:11:47,319
will push forward if I do but you know I

3510
02:11:44,948 --> 02:11:50,319
give I think I've given away over

3511
02:11:47,319 --> 02:11:52,389
yeah thousands of paksy seeds for free

3512
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:53,649
because I don't really I think it's

3513
02:11:52,389 --> 02:11:55,659
funny when people charge a lot of money

3514
02:11:53,649 --> 02:11:57,698
for the CBD rich strains like I know

3515
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:59,920
that's our Trojan horse to get get

3516
02:11:57,698 --> 02:12:02,469
cannabis into like basically all of

3517
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:04,149
America that have been like totally

3518
02:12:02,469 --> 02:12:06,099
brainwashed if there's a plant that can

3519
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:08,559
heal their kids that can heal their

3520
02:12:06,099 --> 02:12:10,300
grandparents we get give those seeds out

3521
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:12,340
like you know I think somebody should

3522
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:14,679
just devote a whole warehouse and just

3523
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:16,300
pump out a million CB seeds get those

3524
02:12:14,679 --> 02:12:18,760
things everywhere like it's truly our

3525
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:20,770
Trojan horse to get into the hearts and

3526
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:22,780
minds of people that have no clue and so

3527
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:25,000
my whole thing is I don't spend as much

3528
02:12:22,779 --> 02:12:26,229
time on the CVD work is because I just

3529
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,960
give it all away free and I usually

3530
02:12:26,229 --> 02:12:30,848
always try and make each pollination run

3531
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:32,500
a couple CBD strains like I'll usually

3532
02:12:30,849 --> 02:12:34,599
throw in an ac/dc or Harlequin into

3533
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:37,300
anything I'm making but for my specific

3534
02:12:34,599 --> 02:12:39,039
CBD projects I think the good medicine

3535
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:40,719
and the perfect doctor were like the

3536
02:12:39,039 --> 02:12:42,729
ones that I really put enough the most

3537
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:44,198
time into and I love it when I see

3538
02:12:42,729 --> 02:12:46,448
people make more of those or use those

3539
02:12:44,198 --> 02:12:48,488
in their own project like I think the

3540
02:12:46,448 --> 02:12:50,379
medical aspect is amazing and it's

3541
02:12:48,488 --> 02:12:52,059
beautiful and I really think that's one

3542
02:12:50,380 --> 02:12:57,460
of the ways that we're really gonna see

3543
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:58,960
cannabis basically become our main plant

3544
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:03,149
oil and earth like it's always been

3545
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:06,579
since you know the the dawn of time and

3546
02:13:03,149 --> 02:13:08,589
so which kind of a nursery which CBD

3547
02:13:06,579 --> 02:13:10,948
strain do you like to work with the most

3548
02:13:08,590 --> 02:13:12,599
I guess in in all regards

3549
02:13:10,948 --> 02:13:14,578
I mean I've personally have had ac/dc

3550
02:13:12,599 --> 02:13:15,929
and I thought that was fantastic and

3551
02:13:14,578 --> 02:13:18,179
then on the other hand I've heard

3552
02:13:15,929 --> 02:13:19,679
breeders say that Charlotte's Web for

3553
02:13:18,179 --> 02:13:21,389
example while being a great strain

3554
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:23,038
doesn't particularly work very well for

3555
02:13:21,389 --> 02:13:24,420
breeding or at least I heard that in the

3556
02:13:23,038 --> 02:13:26,429
sense that it's not very true breeding

3557
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:29,038
like not a lot of the resulting seeds

3558
02:13:26,429 --> 02:13:31,529
will carry those really high CBD traits

3559
02:13:29,038 --> 02:13:34,198
so at least I'm told that with that in

3560
02:13:31,529 --> 02:13:36,179
mind which kind of CBD cuts to shine

3561
02:13:34,198 --> 02:13:39,839
more - or do you find work better for

3562
02:13:36,179 --> 02:13:41,158
your projects well I think I mean I

3563
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:44,429
think white Charlotte's Web doesn't

3564
02:13:41,158 --> 02:13:46,170
totally work out is because it wasn't

3565
02:13:44,429 --> 02:13:49,769
like a finished product it I think those

3566
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:51,840
guys kind of heisted it from another

3567
02:13:49,769 --> 02:13:54,840
breeder that was working on CBD rich

3568
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:56,190
plants and I don't think he'd fully it

3569
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:58,139
was just a one-off of one of the stuff

3570
02:13:56,189 --> 02:14:01,198
and I think he's perfected I think it's

3571
02:13:58,139 --> 02:14:04,288
from a man in Colorado who that we all

3572
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:09,328
know and love and in his name has a

3573
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:11,849
numeric number in it um but I don't want

3574
02:14:09,328 --> 02:14:12,988
to ruffle any feathers so I think that's

3575
02:14:11,849 --> 02:14:14,458
probably why you see Charlotte's Web

3576
02:14:12,988 --> 02:14:16,078
doesn't work is I think it wasn't a

3577
02:14:14,458 --> 02:14:17,609
fully realized line I think it was

3578
02:14:16,078 --> 02:14:19,738
something that is kind of grabbing

3579
02:14:17,609 --> 02:14:22,259
around with high personal II like

3580
02:14:19,738 --> 02:14:24,808
Harlequin myself because it does seem to

3581
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:28,110
be true being it's not it's not coming

3582
02:14:24,809 --> 02:14:30,449
from Spain and that whole z7 like that

3583
02:14:28,109 --> 02:14:33,238
whole you know CBD crew and they tend to

3584
02:14:30,448 --> 02:14:35,219
be kind of territorial and about their

3585
02:14:33,238 --> 02:14:36,988
stuff and they tend to be a little you

3586
02:14:35,219 --> 02:14:38,880
know a little bit snooty so I try and

3587
02:14:36,988 --> 02:14:41,879
stay away from any kind of drama and

3588
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:43,349
Harlequin was brought to America by uh I

3589
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:45,599
think it's a seed fund by Wayne weight

3590
02:14:43,349 --> 02:14:48,260
laughter and it's an old I think it's a

3591
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:50,010
Dutch or Swiss or some kind of old

3592
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:52,769
combination that they had there that

3593
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:54,869
just Express that and it's kind of the

3594
02:14:52,769 --> 02:14:56,639
first one we had in California and I

3595
02:14:54,868 --> 02:14:58,139
think even in the States and I've always

3596
02:14:56,639 --> 02:14:59,940
kind of just connected more with that

3597
02:14:58,139 --> 02:15:01,828
and it you know and it's a beautiful

3598
02:14:59,939 --> 02:15:03,958
plan and it has it's very resinous and

3599
02:15:01,828 --> 02:15:06,149
you know ACDC is awesome it really pumps

3600
02:15:03,958 --> 02:15:08,279
the CBD and it's very true reading it

3601
02:15:06,149 --> 02:15:09,988
really crushes it on that but it it's

3602
02:15:08,279 --> 02:15:12,149
kind of like a wily kind of almost

3603
02:15:09,988 --> 02:15:15,839
sativa like plant you know it's a pretty

3604
02:15:12,149 --> 02:15:17,308
kind of just a giant bush and I mean

3605
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:19,019
I've made some crosses with it that it

3606
02:15:17,309 --> 02:15:21,329
come out great and I've kind of tame the

3607
02:15:19,019 --> 02:15:25,110
beast but I think if I had to choose a

3608
02:15:21,328 --> 02:15:26,938
CBD rich cultivar it would probably be

3609
02:15:25,109 --> 02:15:28,589
the Harlequin although you know coastal

3610
02:15:26,939 --> 02:15:31,769
seeds he's finding that some of their

3611
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:33,779
Panama red work is coming up rich in CBD

3612
02:15:31,769 --> 02:15:35,039
which is really amazing and you know

3613
02:15:33,779 --> 02:15:37,768
that kind of goes back to the whole

3614
02:15:35,038 --> 02:15:39,359
adage of people like oh yeah Panama red

3615
02:15:37,769 --> 02:15:41,369
that's awful Nakia that was like the

3616
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:42,958
tequila bud like it you know even back

3617
02:15:41,368 --> 02:15:44,880
in the day Panama red was kind of known

3618
02:15:42,958 --> 02:15:46,769
as kind of like this knock you on your

3619
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:49,439
ass stuff and that makes sense that it

3620
02:15:46,769 --> 02:15:55,800
maybe was a sativa that had some level

3621
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:57,749
of kind of us CBD in it yeah if we just

3622
02:15:55,800 --> 02:16:00,179
take step back and look at just breeding

3623
02:15:57,748 --> 02:16:02,368
in general not necessarily CBD how do

3624
02:16:00,179 --> 02:16:04,380
you find the location of where you breed

3625
02:16:02,368 --> 02:16:06,469
affects things do you find that when you

3626
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:08,760
I mean obviously there's going to be

3627
02:16:06,469 --> 02:16:12,328
physical differences I've read that I

3628
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:14,280
believe it was the China un strain on

3629
02:16:12,328 --> 02:16:15,808
one of your Instagram posts said it

3630
02:16:14,279 --> 02:16:18,300
doesn't particularly perform well

3631
02:16:15,809 --> 02:16:20,279
indoors so we put that bit aside instead

3632
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:22,800
let's look at the breeding aspect if you

3633
02:16:20,279 --> 02:16:24,359
were to try to read that plant indoor do

3634
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,369
you think that would have you know kind

3635
02:16:24,359 --> 02:16:28,049
of epigenetic effects on the seeds

3636
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:30,359
resulting it's like so do you think that

3637
02:16:28,050 --> 02:16:31,979
landrace lines should be ideally bred

3638
02:16:30,359 --> 02:16:34,170
outside if possible because it's gonna

3639
02:16:31,979 --> 02:16:36,210
you know maybe be more synergistic with

3640
02:16:34,170 --> 02:16:39,599
their genetics or what's your feeling on

3641
02:16:36,209 --> 02:16:44,299
this I mean you know back like ten years

3642
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:48,719
ago I would say that they probably I

3643
02:16:44,299 --> 02:16:53,818
mean that's a tough line so I don't know

3644
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:55,379
I think that you can with if you put

3645
02:16:53,818 --> 02:16:58,170
your will to anything I think you can

3646
02:16:55,379 --> 02:17:00,629
work with the plant and basically get it

3647
02:16:58,170 --> 02:17:03,269
to perform anywhere and I think that

3648
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:04,978
before during prohibition most people

3649
02:17:03,269 --> 02:17:11,300
were growing inside so it was important

3650
02:17:04,978 --> 02:17:15,238
to to try and push that gene pool into

3651
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:16,679
more harmonious expressions inside like

3652
02:17:15,238 --> 02:17:19,019
you wanted to try you need definitely

3653
02:17:16,679 --> 02:17:20,818
landraces freaked out like especially

3654
02:17:19,019 --> 02:17:22,620
ones that you you know like I have a lot

3655
02:17:20,818 --> 02:17:23,879
of problems when I bring then races from

3656
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:26,309
like the Himalayas and I plant them

3657
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:28,079
straight out here at sea level like they

3658
02:17:26,308 --> 02:17:29,459
go cuckoo they don't know what's going

3659
02:17:28,079 --> 02:17:31,228
on there like they're used to being up

3660
02:17:29,459 --> 02:17:32,308
in these high elevations in this certain

3661
02:17:31,228 --> 02:17:34,019
environment and all the sudden now

3662
02:17:32,308 --> 02:17:37,318
they're in the fog line not the beach

3663
02:17:34,019 --> 02:17:38,849
like they really tweak out so I think

3664
02:17:37,318 --> 02:17:41,549
you can create

3665
02:17:38,849 --> 02:17:43,439
a more harmonious environment for them

3666
02:17:41,549 --> 02:17:45,478
indoors if you're really catering to

3667
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:48,569
them but I think it's important though

3668
02:17:45,478 --> 02:17:50,459
to if you are going to make landrace

3669
02:17:48,569 --> 02:17:52,439
hybrids that they are stable indoors

3670
02:17:50,459 --> 02:17:53,938
like that's the whole that's why super

3671
02:17:52,439 --> 02:17:55,110
natural selection has been so hard it's

3672
02:17:53,939 --> 02:17:57,030
taking so long to release all these

3673
02:17:55,110 --> 02:18:00,120
things that's because it's not easy to

3674
02:17:57,030 --> 02:18:02,579
to mate landraces and expect them to do

3675
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:03,750
well inside like they do crazy stuff

3676
02:18:02,579 --> 02:18:05,909
they do weird stuff there

3677
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:07,590
they're very hermaphroditic indoors they

3678
02:18:05,909 --> 02:18:08,459
you know and that's the whole thing with

3679
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:11,280
my road kill

3680
02:18:08,459 --> 02:18:13,648
stunt project I can make sure I make

3681
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:16,079
plants that smell like roadkill and get

3682
02:18:13,648 --> 02:18:17,968
you super high and then I mean they hit

3683
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:20,099
all the you know they've got all the

3684
02:18:17,968 --> 02:18:22,348
eyes and they check all the boxes but

3685
02:18:20,099 --> 02:18:24,420
they they don't like to be indoors like

3686
02:18:22,349 --> 02:18:25,889
for some reason the one I'm working on

3687
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:28,679
it's just it's about finding the

3688
02:18:25,888 --> 02:18:30,539
specific out cost they don't things a

3689
02:18:28,679 --> 02:18:32,010
lot of things just don't like being in

3690
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:34,860
an artificial environment and they

3691
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:38,398
express that so I think there is some

3692
02:18:34,860 --> 02:18:39,750
magic in really working a line indoors

3693
02:18:38,398 --> 02:18:42,209
to remove that from athletes traits but

3694
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:44,280
also outdoors if you can you can create

3695
02:18:42,209 --> 02:18:45,928
some amazing heirlooms if you say say

3696
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:48,210
you went to Thailand and you were in

3697
02:18:45,929 --> 02:18:50,159
Chiang Rai or something and you got a

3698
02:18:48,209 --> 02:18:52,138
sack of pot and you got some seeds and

3699
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:54,599
you loved it and you brought it home and

3700
02:18:52,138 --> 02:18:56,250
you've grown it outside in your garden

3701
02:18:54,599 --> 02:18:58,319
it may tweak out it may hurt him out the

3702
02:18:56,250 --> 02:19:00,299
first time you grow it but and you find

3703
02:18:58,319 --> 02:19:01,920
your favorites you breed those and get

3704
02:19:00,299 --> 02:19:04,558
the seeds you grow it again after three

3705
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:06,360
or four times of it experiencing a new

3706
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:08,159
environment it's gonna reprogram itself

3707
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:09,420
and it's gonna adapt to the new

3708
02:19:08,159 --> 02:19:11,700
environment and it's going to slowly

3709
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:14,010
become your kind of a personal heirloom

3710
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:15,689
so it's all about I mean it's about

3711
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:18,210
doing the work really on those things

3712
02:19:15,689 --> 02:19:22,648
it's you know it's not just taking these

3713
02:19:18,209 --> 02:19:24,569
these hyper chirpy amazing plants that

3714
02:19:22,648 --> 02:19:26,760
are all been bred indoors that are you

3715
02:19:24,569 --> 02:19:28,138
know in slap them together that's it's

3716
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:30,030
easy but trying to get things that are

3717
02:19:28,138 --> 02:19:32,670
from completely different environments

3718
02:19:30,030 --> 02:19:34,710
and bringing him together and anew and

3719
02:19:32,670 --> 02:19:36,799
thing is really difficult it's like that

3720
02:19:34,709 --> 02:19:40,379
it was like that Eddie Murphy movie

3721
02:19:36,799 --> 02:19:41,808
wasn't he was like an African king and

3722
02:19:40,379 --> 02:19:43,968
they dropped him off in New York

3723
02:19:41,808 --> 02:19:46,018
King of Queens or something like that

3724
02:19:43,968 --> 02:19:47,968
yeah it's like the same thing you get a

3725
02:19:46,019 --> 02:19:49,439
plant and then you drop it off here yeah

3726
02:19:47,968 --> 02:19:52,009
I do some work on that thing you can't

3727
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:54,180
you know it's yes

3728
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:55,260
strange things happen and that's the

3729
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:58,260
beauty that's why I really tell people

3730
02:19:55,260 --> 02:20:00,630
it's like explore the gene pool you know

3731
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:03,148
click seeds collect as many seats you

3732
02:20:00,629 --> 02:20:05,670
can't trade seeds like get a good seat

3733
02:20:03,148 --> 02:20:09,090
collection find crazy cultivators travel

3734
02:20:05,670 --> 02:20:11,370
like really give yourself all the

3735
02:20:09,090 --> 02:20:13,559
colours you can to create your your art

3736
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:15,240
you know and also don't let anybody ever

3737
02:20:13,559 --> 02:20:17,069
tell you that you're breathing the wrong

3738
02:20:15,239 --> 02:20:18,500
way like that's one thing I you know I

3739
02:20:17,069 --> 02:20:20,699
have deep respect for all the

3740
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:23,329
horticultural science people and I have

3741
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:25,500
a background kind of in that that I but

3742
02:20:23,329 --> 02:20:27,329
really you know no one can tell you how

3743
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:29,010
to breed the proof is in the pudding if

3744
02:20:27,329 --> 02:20:30,989
you can create something good with your

3745
02:20:29,010 --> 02:20:32,370
skills and either way you do it then

3746
02:20:30,989 --> 02:20:34,409
that's all that matters and it's like

3747
02:20:32,370 --> 02:20:36,660
you don't need a Mendel square you need

3748
02:20:34,409 --> 02:20:39,719
like you need good senses you need an

3749
02:20:36,659 --> 02:20:42,180
open heart open mind you need to create

3750
02:20:39,719 --> 02:20:44,699
awareness with the plant and you can do

3751
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:47,189
anything you never let anyone and all

3752
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:49,079
these people like oh you know I went to

3753
02:20:47,189 --> 02:20:50,550
horticultural science that's beautiful

3754
02:20:49,079 --> 02:20:52,200
you know you can learn all about a

3755
02:20:50,549 --> 02:20:53,639
paintbrush you can learn all about paint

3756
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:56,010
you can learn all about canvas but that

3757
02:20:53,639 --> 02:20:57,779
doesn't make you a good artist so I say

3758
02:20:56,010 --> 02:20:59,550
people just followed a passion grab you

3759
02:20:57,780 --> 02:21:02,820
know really get into this and really

3760
02:20:59,549 --> 02:21:04,559
make it something that nourishes you and

3761
02:21:02,819 --> 02:21:07,139
your community and don't let anyone tell

3762
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:08,879
you what to do and also don't tell

3763
02:21:07,139 --> 02:21:11,789
anybody what they can't do everybody

3764
02:21:08,879 --> 02:21:14,159
needs to get along and really and really

3765
02:21:11,790 --> 02:21:16,020
do this I think we have a great

3766
02:21:14,159 --> 02:21:17,340
community and a great future ahead of us

3767
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:21,270
if we can just keep our eyes on the

3768
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:23,100
prize so I think you already answered it

3769
02:21:21,270 --> 02:21:24,989
a little bit with that last answer but

3770
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:27,630
what would be your advice for a new

3771
02:21:24,989 --> 02:21:29,219
breed oh and by this I mean someone

3772
02:21:27,629 --> 02:21:32,959
who's maybe thinking about getting into

3773
02:21:29,219 --> 02:21:37,559
breeding not someone who's just started

3774
02:21:32,959 --> 02:21:40,469
I would say you know for new breeders is

3775
02:21:37,559 --> 02:21:41,879
a start growing planets grow a lot of

3776
02:21:40,469 --> 02:21:45,478
different plants find what you enjoy

3777
02:21:41,879 --> 02:21:47,250
find what you like and then kind of

3778
02:21:45,478 --> 02:21:48,959
stick to that like if there's a plant

3779
02:21:47,250 --> 02:21:51,389
that speaks to you or a certain strain

3780
02:21:48,959 --> 02:21:53,129
then yeah take that work with that maybe

3781
02:21:51,389 --> 02:21:55,379
mix it with something else you like

3782
02:21:53,129 --> 02:21:57,959
filled up your seed collection trade

3783
02:21:55,379 --> 02:21:59,759
trade clones you know really get into

3784
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:01,228
that form of community make friends like

3785
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:02,969
I think that's the best thing and you

3786
02:22:01,228 --> 02:22:04,648
know what as you as a beginner give away

3787
02:22:02,969 --> 02:22:05,670
seeds make cool stuff give away your

3788
02:22:04,648 --> 02:22:08,699
seeds get the hype

3789
02:22:05,671 --> 02:22:12,421
it's like and you know I also too is

3790
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:13,921
like for me I don't call myself a

3791
02:22:12,421 --> 02:22:15,810
breeder I call myself kinda like a

3792
02:22:13,921 --> 02:22:17,581
artist or I kind of just work with the

3793
02:22:15,810 --> 02:22:21,380
plant maybe I'm just a plant helper I

3794
02:22:17,581 --> 02:22:23,851
really think that using your senses and

3795
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:25,350
you've been using your sixth sense like

3796
02:22:23,851 --> 02:22:27,961
my the whole thing I think is like a

3797
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:29,551
heart race breeding it's like you know

3798
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:31,470
there you have your five senses but you

3799
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:33,091
also have a sixth sense that sense of

3800
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:34,831
kind of this knowing and that's

3801
02:22:33,091 --> 02:22:37,261
basically your heart you know your heart

3802
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:39,421
has an electromagnetic force five

3803
02:22:37,261 --> 02:22:42,060
thousand times bigger than your mind it

3804
02:22:39,421 --> 02:22:43,671
radiates out like five feet and I think

3805
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:46,739
that's where people you know they get a

3806
02:22:43,671 --> 02:22:48,271
where you can kind of feel things out

3807
02:22:46,739 --> 02:22:50,159
and if you can tune into that that's

3808
02:22:48,271 --> 02:22:51,631
where you can connect with nature that's

3809
02:22:50,159 --> 02:22:53,190
also where people get their sixth sense

3810
02:22:51,630 --> 02:22:54,210
or that was funny feeling about

3811
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:55,530
something and they connect with

3812
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:57,960
something that's like the hearts

3813
02:22:55,530 --> 02:22:59,431
electromagnetic field interacting with

3814
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:02,010
other things and I think cultivating

3815
02:22:59,431 --> 02:23:04,351
that and cultivating our awareness of

3816
02:23:02,011 --> 02:23:06,301
yourself and the plant just being a good

3817
02:23:04,351 --> 02:23:08,101
person and being friendly and being

3818
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:10,350
humble I think that's the best way to

3819
02:23:08,101 --> 02:23:12,841
start out breeding and just if you have

3820
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:14,791
passion and you have your senses intact

3821
02:23:12,841 --> 02:23:17,620
then you're here all the way there

3822
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:24,819
pretty much you just gotta move forward

3823
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:27,400
[Music]

3824
02:23:24,819 --> 02:23:30,239
[Applause]

3825
02:23:27,399 --> 02:23:33,409
stay tuned far2

3826
