5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,858
genetics Trends the future so much more

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,039
very excited to have him on the show

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,380
thank you for joining us again direwolf

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,179
oh thanks for having me man

9
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,858
always a pleasure always a pleasure

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,239
first question I want to know what have

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,320
you been smoking on today or have you

12
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,538
even been smoking today what are you

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,058
smoking on yesterday

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,939
I I have not been smoking today I've

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,099
been working all day but I've I'm

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,959
actually traveling at the moment all

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,160
week so I do I'm trying to think what

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,160
I've got in my travel jar I think I have

19
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:50,038
ghost of Leroy from rare dankness which

20
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:54,299
is kind of like a ghost OG triangle

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:57,600
cross and some purple kush which is like

22
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,058
a Canadian classic and

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,679
I've got some GMO and I actually just

24
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,538
got a couple of days ago from visiting

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,159
some big commercial living soil friends

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,019
of mine that gave me

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,900
some of the they've always got the

28
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:13,140
newest stuff I think they gave me gas

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,820
Truffles and greasy runs and something

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,219
else I can't remember

31
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,139
got a good selection that does sound

32
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,400
really nice I want to jump into a few of

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,099
those and hear your thoughts but just

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,780
out of curiosity you mentioned quite a

35
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,519
nice range of genetics you know from the

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,040
old school Purple Kush through to the

37
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,599
newest you know greasy runs what stands

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
out the most to you out of the four or

39
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,578
five you just sort of mentioned

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,259
uh probably the oh honestly that one to

41
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,879
me uh that's kind of a lovely

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,400
relationship with it because it's so

43
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,078
nasty sometimes you crave it and

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,978
sometimes you cringe when you open the

45
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,658
jar but I still think that's a

46
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,000
um strain all the way around

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,020
oh sorry I think I I lost you for a

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
second there what was the name of that

49
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,719
one we heard everything just not the

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,840
name of it oh GMO

51
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,399
I'm saying the rankness of GMO yeah okay

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,799
that's what I thought

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,680
yeah beautiful beautiful and out of

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,360
curiosity have you ever had many strains

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,659
from rare dankness because I've actually

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,920
grown out ghost of Leroy myself and I

57
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,719
thought it was a pretty good strain but

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,458
I feel like um you don't hear a lot

59
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,959
about rare dankness have you ever had

60
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,420
much experience with their genetics or

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,280
not particularly not particularly I

62
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,859
actually that's I only ever bought one

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,719
pack from him quite a long time ago but

64
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,160
it was a standout pack where that was I

65
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,080
would consider it one of the best packs

66
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,120
I've ever bought in my life it was just

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,459
like a counter a 12 pack and there is

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,400
two like super super nice

69
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,378
oh geez it came out of it and that one

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
is actually I think that's the longest

71
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:43,739
I've of any of the Clones that I've held

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
personally that I popped that's

73
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,000
that's the one I was super impressed

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,739
with it oh wow that was the Ghost of

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,199
Leroy was it

76
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,819
yeah I was a ghost of Leroy

77
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,560
the reason why I picked that one myself

78
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,079
as well is because it's so heavy on the

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,900
OG isn't it it's like TK into ghost into

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,379
TK it's uh it's a cool one for if you're

81
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,519
looking for OG and Seed form

82
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:07,018
yeah I actually just picked it randomly

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,180
I was just at a trade show for something

84
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,939
else and uh I just randomly bought it

85
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,080
and I just wanted to try an OG pack and

86
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:14,939
uh you know it turned out super nice

87
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,040
it's a funny strain because I that

88
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,079
cologne when I first ran it is still the

89
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,000
tastiest clone I've ever grown

90
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,099
personally and I was probably like I

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,719
don't know seven or eight years ago and

92
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,119
I've been chasing that flare ever since

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,979
and never got it to to uh pop the Terps

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,599
like that one or two times it's still

95
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,000
super nice but I know it has the

96
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,639
potential but uh I guess I don't have

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,500
the skills to bring it up I'm so glad

98
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,598
you said that because I've had a similar

99
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,340
experience where I'm like chasing that

100
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,679
first cycle with like a different plant

101
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,959
and um it's good to hear I'm not alone

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,700
because I sort of I'm like no it was

103
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,519
definitely a worse grower back then how

104
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,199
did I make it pop so hard like it's an

105
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,319
interesting one but I guess while we're

106
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:58,139
on the topic of uh maybe not being quite

107
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,658
as good grower and making things shine

108
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,539
well I'd love to talk some of the early

109
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:05,759
days of uh the BC growing life with you

110
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,979
and I guess the the point I'd like to

111
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,179
start it off with is I'd love to hear

112
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,179
your experience because we have we have

113
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,200
lots of chats in the in the DMS and I I

114
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,379
value

115
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,259
um how should I say I feel like your

116
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,060
perspectives are very honest and

117
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,680
um unbiased and so I want to start off

118
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,780
by asking you hear a lot of people

119
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,639
talking about the olden days of cannabis

120
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,679
and like how it was so much better

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,360
certain strains were just insane you

122
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,560
don't see that anymore do you think it

123
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,780
really was like that or do you think we

124
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,639
have a bit of Rose shade glasses and you

125
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,039
know like good quality wasn't around as

126
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,418
much all that sort of stuff I think a

127
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,180
hundred percent it's a million times

128
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:45,478
better today I think it was a lot more

129
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,699
varied back then um like these days it's

130
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,199
I do find it's like super limited and

131
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,240
like everything's kind of an OG or

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,560
cookies or and back then you really

133
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,939
there's definitely some stuff when I

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,959
look back and I'm like oh that was way

135
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,399
different and there's nothing around

136
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,099
like it now

137
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,560
I also don't lose sight of the fact that

138
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,060
most of it was garbage

139
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,500
um there was a both the stuff that

140
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,079
people were growing I mean you could

141
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,759
like I kind of got started back in the

142
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,500
have been around like since the late 80s

143
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,879
but I started in the growing scene in

144
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,040
the early 90s and I mean back then

145
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,899
nobody even tried hardly anyone even

146
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,400
saved good stuff they just popped a pack

147
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,918
and whatever was the biggest yielder

148
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,719
that was your keeper and because you

149
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
could sell anything

150
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,120
um so but I did see some there was

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,860
definitely some nice stuff but it was uh

152
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,478
I would say there was a whole lot of

153
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,860
mids around

154
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,659
um the only ones that really there's a

155
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,038
couple that stand out from back then but

156
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,820
honestly like if I had to go back in

157
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,918
time

158
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,538
I I can honestly think of like there was

159
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,620
an old NL clone that we used to have

160
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,139
that I would love to give back I've

161
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,340
never seen anything like that since and

162
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,379
there's some other good stuff but

163
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,119
they're mostly still similar stuff today

164
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,800
there's like you know some of the hazes

165
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,240
were nice I could still get similar

166
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,939
stuff today

167
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,740
some of the northern light stuff was

168
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:57,240
nice but to me I just kind of think like

169
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,978
Bubba and stuff like that are basically

170
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,840
just modern day Northern Lights of the

171
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,038
type that I liked but there's a lot of

172
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,619
there's a lot of garbage back there

173
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:08,240
honestly man it was people remember the

174
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,399
good stuff but it was pretty dismal

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,620
okay well good to hear that I haven't

176
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,359
missed the Golden Age of cannabis in a

177
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,860
sense I'd be curious to hear you

178
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
mentioned Northern Lights and one of the

179
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,319
questions I wanted to ask you was back

180
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,439
in like the 90s say in uh the Pacific

181
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,180
Northwest of the USA when Northern

182
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,459
Lights and those sort of colors were

183
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,139
really starting to take off did they

184
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,299
just come up and cross the border around

185
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,280
that time or did was there a bit of a

186
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,960
delay before they made their way up to

187
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,418
you so to speak

188
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,459
yeah I don't know I'm guessing they

189
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,560
probably did but I think most of it was

190
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,060
I mean if you I don't really I'm not I

191
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,339
don't remember the exact dates but it

192
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,978
was around like what when I kind of got

193
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,439
into the growing scene it was like night

194
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:55,079
probably around 91 like I was around it

195
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,779
but I really it was like 91 or so anyway

196
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,180
I just remember when I started most of

197
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,698
the stuff was second hand from seed bank

198
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,500
so it was like Neville stuff was what I

199
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,379
can tell is like a lot of people ordered

200
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,300
stuff in around 88 or so that time for

201
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:10,978
the late 80s and then they got shut down

202
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,439
by the DEA and you couldn't get seeds

203
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,899
anywhere so what all you got was

204
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,339
basically whatever f2s or clones getting

205
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,500
passed around from people that had

206
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,439
bought from the seed bag I think there's

207
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,740
probably some stuff around BC and that

208
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,360
that might come up from Seattle but who

209
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,120
knows I think the reality if you look

210
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,520
back in Canadian history a huge portion

211
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,800
of it was old seed bank

212
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,079
um genetics and also you got to remember

213
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,340
where I kind of been back and forth and

214
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm originally from like the Toronto

215
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,719
area of Canada which is yeah it's kind

216
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,519
of always our kind of crew was kind of

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,440
half based in BC and half based in

218
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,299
Ontario and I've always

219
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,639
bumped back and forth between those two

220
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,560
places but I was mostly in Ontario

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,780
around Toronto area and it was super

222
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,579
like they're two different regions of

223
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,679
Canada and where I lived it was super

224
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,500
hardcore for like policing and stuff for

225
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,120
cannabis so people were pretty tight

226
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,098
like there wasn't a whole lot of sharing

227
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,379
of anything like that it was like

228
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,060
whatever was in your own crew and then

229
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,038
BCU was a complete opposite like nobody

230
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,780
had been put in jail in like a decade or

231
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,639
something for for growing it was a bit

232
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,318
of a free-for-all but even I got the

233
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,418
feeling like in DC I don't think there

234
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,460
was a ton of sharing outside of like

235
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:22,740
pretty tight networks like even there

236
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,378
like you kept your your head down pretty

237
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,319
good it was gonna get lobbed off yeah

238
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,500
look certainly it makes sense

239
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,560
um I'd be interested to to ask like at

240
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,080
what point do you think that the laws

241
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,699
really started to relax on the East

242
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,038
Coast or do you think they still haven't

243
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,200
really caught up with the West Coast

244
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,939
uh there is pretty relaxed now it has

245
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,920
been pretty recent like it was pretty

246
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,839
crazy like I remember even after

247
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,939
legalization which I'm not like full

248
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,019
legalization which I'm not sure I don't

249
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,760
remember what exactly when that was

250
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,980
probably about seven or eight years ago

251
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,360
I live in a area that's like The Big

252
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,060
Greenhouse area and there was some

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,440
massive like legal cannabis places and I

254
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,599
don't own like a big property and the

255
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,080
property was still getting flown by the

256
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,000
police looking for people growing plants

257
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,220
in the backyard while there was like 20

258
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,620
acres of legal weed like a kilometer

259
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,519
away so it was those habits died died

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,560
hard with the uh Ontario police force

261
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,200
these days it's a free-for-all but back

262
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,719
but it took it took a long time it used

263
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,860
to literally be like like most of the

264
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
time that I was growing if you got

265
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,860
caught with a single plant you were

266
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,060
going to jail period

267
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,278
wow that that sounds really brutal

268
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,958
yeah I know it was it was a war zone man

269
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,879
it's interesting because you hear about

270
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,799
how the USA historically had really

271
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,000
harsh penalties but I guess it's

272
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,620
interesting to hear that they weren't

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,958
really too much different just over the

274
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,320
Border I'd love to ask you if we roll

275
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,299
back a little bit what was I've always

276
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,879
been interested what did Gorilla growing

277
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,679
look like in Canada back in like you

278
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,299
know the 80s and 90s when people were

279
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,059
just starting to really grow flower

280
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,399
because I guess you hear about Gorilla

281
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,559
growing in the state some stuff but in

282
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,019
Canada the the conditions are just harsh

283
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,359
I imagined for a good chunk of the year

284
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,459
how did that work was it really limited

285
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,019
or like what was the limiting factor in

286
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:16,079
your Gorilla Grow just the stealth or

287
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,659
the environment so most of Canada

288
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,459
um basically like where I most of

289
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,799
Canada's it's really situated along the

290
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:25,199
U.S border the population but there's a

291
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,219
giant vast Wilderness Area like pretty

292
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,300
much wherever you live only a couple

293
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,339
hours North

294
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:30,958
so it was basically impossible to grow

295
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,000
along the southern areas because it was

296
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,500
you just get either busted or somebody

297
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,200
would rip it off so everyone kind of

298
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,879
grew up in like the Wilderness areas and

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,259
there you were really limited especially

300
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,600
back then the main thing I remember

301
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,819
about cannabis or cannabis in Canada in

302
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,740
that period this genetics were really

303
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,839
locked down he couldn't get any so like

304
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,240
when I went like just for roughly when I

305
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,579
started growing you could not it was

306
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,799
illegal to buy anything telling you how

307
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:57,958
to grow cannabis it was illegal to buy

308
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,159
seeds anywhere like there's basically no

309
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,319
place in the world other than you

310
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,439
literally had to fly to Amsterdam to get

311
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,700
seeds and snuggle them back and so

312
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,860
basically what you got is the people

313
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,140
that were in the game you just I mean

314
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,480
that's how our crew kind of got started

315
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,980
is we were the had good genetics and you

316
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
just kept it on lockdown and nobody

317
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,079
nobody else could get in but especially

318
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,419
the case with outdoor genetics because

319
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,699
uh basically nothing finished out here

320
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,559
um you had to be out in a lot of areas

321
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,320
but kind of third week of September was

322
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,059
kind of the magic number and basically

323
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,420
nothing finished there was a couple of

324
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:35,759
really crappy Dutch strains so it was

325
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,799
really uh it was all about that's kind

326
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,200
of how I got into the genetics what end

327
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,958
of things was if you're in the game you

328
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,399
had to like basically breed your own

329
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,319
genetics because you couldn't get it

330
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,179
from anywhere else so that was a

331
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,000
limiting factor and kind of

332
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,739
you know our crew kind of got into some

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,480
of the earlier stuff was which was

334
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,860
mostly of Canada the early stuff is

335
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,899
based around a strain called Mighty

336
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,399
might and that was kind of like a

337
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,078
depending on the phenotes kind of an

338
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,120
auto to semi-auto on it would finish

339
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,620
anywhere and you could also get it in

340
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,720
before like it used to be back in the

341
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,820
old days like a drought so in this end

342
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,040
of the summer through the summer there'd

343
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,200
be no weed and you could if you had weed

344
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,219
you could sell it for really high prices

345
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,240
just uh really really easily so these

346
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,240
strains kind of um

347
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,620
I allowed you to hit that you know get

348
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,720
it in and also get it in before uh on

349
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,519
all the mainstream stuff started coming

350
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,259
in then the prices dropped when you get

351
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,139
in early so it was definitely genetics

352
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:36,000
and willingness to do like hardcore

353
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,600
stuff to pull it off like some of the

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,220
I've seen some crazy stuff to where we

355
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,899
used to grow one of the places we

356
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,420
literally used to like drive a couple of

357
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,639
hours then canoe about two hours Into

358
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:51,059
the Wilderness and we had like a grow

359
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,740
out it grows out in the swamps so you

360
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,979
could kind of water them I'd say swamp

361
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,120
growing is one of the big Canadian

362
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,800
Canadian things because we've got plenty

363
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,720
of swamps and no one in the right mind

364
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,219
is going to go in a Canadian swamp in

365
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,459
the summer because the bugs were just

366
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,220
you know Fierce uh that's cool that's

367
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:11,759
like a nice little bit of uh what would

368
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:15,000
you say like human IPM

369
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,679
yeah yeah yeah it was different I mean

370
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,259
it said it was that's like a real

371
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,778
Community I think the Canadian gorilla

372
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,000
was quite a bit different than the

373
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,919
us stuff because it was I don't know it

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,659
just seemed a lot different because uh

375
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,099
hey you're growing really small plants

376
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,480
because in order something to finish by

377
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,220
September 3rd you weren't throwing like

378
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,740
you know two Pounders they were more

379
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,079
like quarter pound was a good plant and

380
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,159
it's mostly Rock so you can't dig

381
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,359
anywhere

382
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,620
um so you couldn't get that was one of

383
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
the big problems is there's you couldn't

384
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,778
dig a hole you had to basically either

385
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,699
float something on top of a swamp or

386
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:49,559
um they did a lot of like whatever we

387
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,720
put bushel baskets on top of a swamp so

388
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,799
it's self-water or there's a bunch of

389
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
different methods but it was always

390
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,759
interesting back then you'd stumble I

391
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,920
stumbled across quite a few you know

392
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,059
Wilderness gorilla grows and that's that

393
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,679
was kind of before the internet so

394
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,539
that's how you learned you're like

395
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,219
how people different people do is by

396
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,319
stumbling on there was a lot of patches

397
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,000
back then and stumble onto somebody else

398
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,639
and oh man I never thought of you know

399
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,620
dropping bushel baskets on my

400
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,839
four-wheeler and dropping it in a on top

401
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,179
of a wet part of a swamp as like raised

402
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,800
beds or there was other ones on the I've

403
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,259
seen on the east coast of Canada where

404
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,939
we have these like kind of oh their

405
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,500
official name is but it's like a

406
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,120
floating so you could actually it's

407
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,820
almost like standing on a water bed so

408
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,679
it's kind of like uh surface layer of

409
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,100
soil and Moss and it's just floating

410
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,319
over top of the pond and uh

411
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,459
they would grow on top of that and it

412
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,199
would just the roots would just grow

413
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,000
right down into the swamp like the water

414
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,698
Roots there's a bunch of

415
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,720
crazy uh methods and probably a bunch of

416
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:48,359
stuff I've never heard about before

417
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,060
because everyone kept it tight

418
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,339
that's cool I would uh I'd be interested

419
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,679
to hear the uh the terroir and the

420
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:59,760
Fiverr the swamp weed literally sounds

421
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,399
fun but um I'd love to ask you we had a

422
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,379
white buffalo on the show recently and

423
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,720
they referenced an early Canadian strain

424
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,159
I'll be honest I I wasn't I've heard of

425
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,199
it but I'm not as familiar with it as I

426
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,240
should be but I'd love to hear if you

427
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,359
have any experience with it the old

428
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,879
spice of life cream sodaka did you have

429
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,180
much interaction with that one at all

430
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,220
yeah I actually grew it I was that was

431
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:26,159
in my opinion one of I think it kind of

432
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,320
became an important building block but

433
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,539
honestly like just to clarify in my

434
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,360
opinion most of the Canadian Outdoor

435
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:35,879
weeds has never been that great with the

436
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,919
genetics being able to finish like in in

437
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,838
some parts of Canada you can grow some

438
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,479
like kind of more indoor like regular

439
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,639
strains but most parts of Canada when

440
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,680
you're limited to that so like for

441
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,539
instance like if you grow like

442
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:52,259
I don't know like a Bubba or something

443
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:55,139
like that I personally there's like a

444
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:57,319
lot of decent weed I I haven't smoked a

445
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,360
whole lot of like really good Canadian

446
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,699
Outdoor short season weed

447
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,740
um and I would say no offense to uh

448
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,698
reader Steve but cream sodic would fall

449
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,680
into that

450
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,479
that realm I think that probably so that

451
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,979
was like an early like it's a purple one

452
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,240
and that was kind of some of the earlier

453
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,379
stuff we were working with which was

454
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
like

455
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,740
um I used to work with one outdoor

456
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,600
genetics

457
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,339
um we sell this purple stuff that came

458
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,879
out of Holland and it was pretty

459
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,560
horrible it looked really good but it

460
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,720
didn't taste that good

461
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,819
um and it didn't get you that high and

462
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,899
I'm thinking the purple the cream sodico

463
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,699
was one of them sort of put it in

464
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,860
perspective reader Steve when he

465
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,198
released it he immediately pulled it off

466
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,560
the market and kind of regretted it

467
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,838
because even though it was uh I think a

468
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,578
good like production strain it was

469
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,380
definitely like lacking in some of those

470
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,239
other areas

471
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,159
wow that's interesting perspective

472
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,959
that's that's cool to hear and I mean

473
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,120
while we're on the topic of purple

474
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,518
cannabis you mentioned the Purple Kush

475
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,039
earlier and you said it was a Canadian

476
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,259
favorite you got my brain juices sort of

477
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,838
pumping around I I had remembered that

478
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,759
it was a popular one in Canada

479
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,798
um but I was interested to know do you

480
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,240
know which cutting of the Purple Kush

481
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,980
that is because I know there's a few and

482
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,279
I think the popular one is like the the

483
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,980
SR whatever is it that one or a

484
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,798
different one as far as you know uh I've

485
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,500
got a couple that particular that's like

486
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:25,740
a seed line that that I run and it's

487
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,058
actually uh based off of uh Garberville

488
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,039
one

489
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:31,798
um which is just the Barberville Purple

490
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,480
Kush which is one that came which isn't

491
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,819
so it's a California one not a Canadian

492
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,620
one but it's been around Canada for

493
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:39,480
probably like I think I don't know when

494
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,819
I first saw it early 2000s or so

495
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,380
supposedly got snuggled up in the door

496
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,480
of somebody's car that was fleeing

497
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,220
California on charges but

498
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,620
um there's a couple so Purple Kush it's

499
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,819
kind of a weird Canadian thing first of

500
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:52,558
all a lot of the purple fish we have up

501
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,720
here isn't actually purple

502
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,399
um but it was kind of a I'm trying to

503
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,220
think it was early kind of weird

504
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,980
especially BC where

505
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,960
for on the commercial Scene It was

506
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,079
really like it would be like all one

507
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,419
clone so be like for like a few years I

508
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,279
think White Buffalo there's like these

509
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,140
arrows and it was like in the early

510
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,960
2000s it was like purple kush and

511
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,700
everybody was growing purple kush and

512
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,340
there was a few different types but it

513
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,600
was mostly one clone and then there was

514
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,939
another era it was like the hash plant

515
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,500
era and I think if you go back earlier

516
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,500
it was the there's a Northern Lights

517
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,919
thing and a big bud and purple kush was

518
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:35,700
a long pretty long-standing era in the

519
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,380
early 2000s and we talked to one guy who

520
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,519
I'm pretty sure is this kind of source

521
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,559
for her and it was actually a California

522
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,960
broker

523
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,019
that smuggled up the Clone and I think

524
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,360
it was kind of during that Koji Kush era

525
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,759
um and it was actually a Kush we call it

526
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,979
purple kush but when I've grown out s1's

527
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,960
of it and stuff it pops at OG Thanos I

528
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,298
think it was basically the first OG Kush

529
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,860
it doesn't look like an OG Kush but when

530
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:03,298
you taste it you're like that's got that

531
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:04,979
kush Funk to it and when you pop seed

532
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:06,779
lines out of it not the Garber build

533
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,120
that's a separate one

534
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,918
um but the main one that everyone I just

535
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,959
call it the BC Purple Kush that's the

536
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,299
main one that everyone was growing and

537
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,460
that one I'm pretty convinced was an OG

538
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,558
and uh

539
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,179
I've talked to the actually talked to

540
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,639
the broker

541
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,200
um that supposedly brought it up and I'm

542
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,120
pretty sure it probably came from him

543
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,380
and he told me it was uh

544
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:33,359
uh Hollywood Purple Kush cross with

545
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,919
Bubba which I've never even heard of a

546
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,019
Hollywood purple Crush I kind of want to

547
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,059
wonder if it's the Hollywood pure kush

548
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,160
but anyway he was a big broker and he

549
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:44,099
was back in the first early days of that

550
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,480
fishing in California and a lot of the

551
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,819
BC

552
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,558
um Growers that there was it was an

553
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,779
export market right so brought up this

554
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,940
cut and gave it to a bunch of you know

555
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:56,700
organized crime gangs to grow for him

556
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,019
and this whole story totally as like

557
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,220
everything like matched I have

558
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:01,740
laid-backs that's probably what it is

559
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,179
and it matches with the s1s and Crosses

560
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,700
that have grown out come from it it's

561
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,780
nothing special it's a nice clone but

562
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,120
the other thing I was Finding funny

563
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,619
about the Canadian Purple Kush is a lot

564
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,298
of them didn't really go super purple

565
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:13,979
they kind of have like a little bit of

566
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:16,400
purple and the calyx is or if you really

567
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,079
drop the temperature it would be like

568
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,259
lavender but but it sounded a lot like

569
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,240
the Urkel story from California

570
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:26,400
yeah wow there's so many interesting

571
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,319
talking points you drop there and I mean

572
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
I've certainly heard of the Garberville

573
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:34,139
purple I mean uh Mean Gene well-known

574
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,500
breeder he uses that in his work as well

575
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,240
so definitely some uh established uh

576
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,519
provenance behind that one and you know

577
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,620
what I'm I'm so stoked that you

578
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,440
referenced that a lot of the Purple Kush

579
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,879
doesn't go purple because one one of not

580
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,440
the very first because I've told this

581
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,539
story on other podcasts like the first

582
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
good weed I ever had that really got my

583
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:56,700
mind ticking about weed was some green

584
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,319
Granddaddy Purple like the second or

585
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,660
third strain I got to try that was

586
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,939
really good was some green purple kush

587
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,100
and I always look back on it and was

588
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,240
like [ __ ] that was good like but it I

589
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,819
don't know if it was actually Purple

590
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,440
Kush and then I just realized it

591
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,899
actually like my mate did tell me he got

592
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,580
it from like an online Canadian weed

593
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,500
seller or whatever back in the day so

594
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,298
like it could well be similar because it

595
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,980
was definitely nice stuff but that's

596
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:22,259
cool you've pulled a lot of those sort

597
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,919
of stories together for me I would love

598
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:28,140
to sort of move to a topic that's hard

599
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,140
to get a lot of info about you mentioned

600
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,120
it yourself that the hash plant era it

601
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,280
seems like pink cush has been popular

602
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,099
for quite a while and from what white

603
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,779
buffalo told us those hash plants and

604
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,699
pink cushes are sort of from the same

605
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,220
era what's your perspective and

606
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,080
recollection on the hashplan era so to

607
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,640
speak

608
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,678
um so the hash Point Eric kind of start

609
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,780
like right from this Iron Rock was I was

610
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,000
in like University in like the 90s early

611
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,980
90s and I can remember some of those

612
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,200
cuts like champagne was one of them that

613
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,779
came out of that same group of people

614
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,940
they were like biker Cuts I think is the

615
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:06,779
all the PO all the stories point back

616
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:09,240
towards a group of bikers and champagne

617
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,200
was probably the most elite cut back

618
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,519
then

619
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,659
um like we'd never seen anything like it

620
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,579
at the time

621
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:17,340
so it was going around back then but it

622
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:20,460
really kind of blew up where we had I

623
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:22,980
think it was the early medical days and

624
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,179
there was you could get

625
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,940
I can't remember if it was like there

626
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,860
was mandatory minimums around 10 plants

627
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,798
or if it was you could get a medical

628
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:34,259
card for 10 plants but for a while it

629
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,960
was like these crazy scenes where they

630
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,460
would like drop down these vertical they

631
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,140
were called biker buckets so it'd be

632
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,579
like like a hempy bucket or whatever

633
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,640
they call like a big five gallon tail

634
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:47,519
and some Hydro corn and uh super high

635
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,900
power bubbler in the bottom and with

636
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,099
like coolers and stuff and it was like

637
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,559
really high tech and then they would

638
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,959
drop these vertical thousand watt bulbs

639
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,779
and they'd have one bulb per plant and

640
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,100
grow these massive massive beasts like

641
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,500
they'd be commercial Growers that had 10

642
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:03,119
plants in them and in order to yield in

643
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,579
them there was only a couple of strains

644
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,339
that could actually do it and and one

645
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:10,199
was uh it was a hash plant and the other

646
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,699
one was like a BC big but I don't I

647
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,519
think the hash plant was decent quality

648
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,259
the BC big bud was horrid

649
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,460
um but that was their claim to think if

650
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,900
you wanted to grow the 10 plants you had

651
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,700
to grow like one of these handful of

652
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,960
clones anything else you'd get like you

653
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,759
know three quarters of a pound of light

654
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,340
or something like that

655
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,038
yeah wow so champagne's an interesting

656
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:31,019
one from a few perspectives I guess I

657
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,140
feel like you don't hear about it as

658
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:36,599
much as say the king but I have

659
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,240
certainly heard about it a lot uh how

660
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,819
would you describe it is it like a like

661
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,140
a Kush sort of plant ever tried it a

662
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,759
couple times it was going back quite a

663
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,480
ways it was just I consider most of

664
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,940
those more of like a kind of

665
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,500
differentiate hash plans and pushes I

666
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,600
find like cushions are kind of more the

667
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,220
more modern like OG type I mean that's

668
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,099
not traditional obviously fishes it

669
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,440
could be anything but I consider those

670
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:03,779
ones more like of a pure hash plant so

671
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,659
they didn't have they just tasted like

672
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:09,359
acts it wasn't like that nude it wasn't

673
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:11,940
like OG I'm a big hash plant guy right I

674
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,979
like the effects and I had kind of up

675
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,860
until OG kush and purple cushion stuff

676
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,200
kind of committed I mean that's my

677
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,879
preference for effect and I'm stuck

678
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,500
smoking stuff that doesn't taste that

679
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,000
great because it was just not bad it

680
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,619
just tasted like hash and that's what

681
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,900
champagne was kind of like it looked

682
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,759
good in a bag it yielded good but I

683
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,360
would consider this like a a pretty

684
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,319
generic I high quality but generic hash

685
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,099
plant

686
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:40,139
yeah okay that's interesting and did you

687
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,699
ever grow any of these Cuts yourself in

688
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,559
the early days or were they so tightly

689
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,080
held that like you just sort of got buds

690
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,000
of them here and there

691
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,558
no definitely not in the early days

692
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,900
that's kind of a

693
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:55,319
um I've grown I'd say most of what's

694
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,900
going around up until like the last

695
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:01,379
decade I got I got whatever Cuts were

696
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,298
going through my kind of extended crew

697
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,039
which was pretty like I said it was a

698
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:07,440
tight scene like these

699
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,960
I was like rolling with since like the

700
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,000
since my University days like since the

701
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,558
90s and some of those guys were pretty

702
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,720
connected and I'd get whatever they

703
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,759
happen to be which is usually some of

704
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,079
the good commercial Cuts but most of the

705
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,599
stuff was locked down pretty hard and

706
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,579
even if it wasn't up until pretty

707
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,899
recently but I did grow a lot of uh like

708
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,178
stuff like the grapefruit was the real

709
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,620
famous clone back there and I could have

710
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,720
actually could have gotten that a few

711
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,719
times but I've grown out a crapload of

712
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,278
grapefruit crosses

713
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,079
um so I have a good feeling what okay

714
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,480
what grapefruit is like just from

715
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,558
growing out you know 50 or 60 seeds of

716
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,720
it

717
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,740
um and that's the same thing with the

718
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,480
Ashland it's a different

719
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,460
write a bunch of them in like the actual

720
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,640
cologne and from dispensaries and stuff

721
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,980
but I've never uh never grown any of any

722
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,200
of those coveted ones I've never really

723
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,380
uh

724
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,380
grown myself

725
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:05,339
yeah not a problem that sounds like you

726
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,798
still have a really diverse range of

727
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:10,859
experience which is great to hear out of

728
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:13,740
curiosity did you ever try any of that

729
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,899
fabled breeder Steve DJ Short collab

730
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,579
stuff or was that more of like a seed

731
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,500
release they did and it wasn't

732
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,699
necessarily like stuff passed out to

733
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,798
locals

734
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,840
I think that was pretty tight I actually

735
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,339
have tried some of the stuff this is the

736
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,240
funny thing about Canada is there's I

737
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,038
don't know whether it's actually true

738
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,019
but people are always between you know

739
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,058
Ontario and BC especially most people

740
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,619
live in kind of three main parts of

741
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,839
Canada and I don't know whether that's

742
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,339
actually true in Canada but definitely

743
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,678
within the weed scene you were never

744
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:43,918
more than about three people or moved so

745
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,538
I kind of had I actually had like two

746
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,980
group separate groups of friends that

747
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:48,599
were all like one person removed from

748
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,980
that reader Steve crew and actually one

749
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,219
of my friends was actually involved in

750
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,480
that grow so I actually tried the it was

751
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,700
something crashed I can't really I think

752
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,900
it was Blue Crush or something came out

753
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,919
of that one

754
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,600
um I can't remember the actual name but

755
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,100
it was Crush for sure

756
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,359
um I did try that it's good I'm not a

757
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:05,879
giant uh

758
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,219
blueberry DJ Short fan I respect

759
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,900
honestly it's not my taste of weed

760
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,200
um so I did try some of that and it

761
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,179
actually grew some of the seeds

762
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,580
um I never they were decent

763
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,200
nice nice

764
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:21,960
and actually sir I did right now that I

765
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,298
think back I grew a bunch of

766
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,720
I think I grew a bunch of Time Warp

767
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:29,460
crossed with that blue uh true blue the

768
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,798
blueberry male they used in that that

769
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,360
actually came from Red at Legend seeds I

770
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:35,220
grew that outdoor for a few years too so

771
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,479
I definitely tried a few yeah wow

772
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,700
interesting and you just mentioned

773
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,339
Legend seeds I think a lot of people are

774
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,100
probably unaware that DJ did that collab

775
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,658
with them and a few cool lesser known

776
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:48,240
strains came out of it like you know red

777
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,179
eye bride and a few other ones what was

778
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,460
it toe jam and stuff did you ever have

779
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,080
much of a positive impression from those

780
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,319
ones and how come you think they don't

781
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,939
get uh recognized as much

782
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,700
all right the thing you remember about

783
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,460
that time in frame in Canada the export

784
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,519
Market was all about it had to look a

785
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,919
certain way almost no hairs really dumb

786
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,538
criteria if you think back it was like

787
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,000
it had to be super late green like that

788
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:16,740
was the main limit that exactly

789
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,019
um so a lot of that was to me that was

790
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,700
like commercial where it was decent

791
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,158
um it was definitely good weed I I

792
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,659
didn't really I grew a bunch of it and

793
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,980
it wasn't something that I would keep

794
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,880
around personally but it was definitely

795
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,278
good yeah nice good perspective

796
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,020
so I know that you've done some

797
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,480
different cultivation writing over the

798
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:38,700
years for cannabis Canada and cannabis

799
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,798
culture what was that experience like

800
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,900
and would you ever consider doing more

801
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,158
of that sort of creative writing

802
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,740
um I think that was a moment in time

803
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,440
yeah so basically go to my my history as

804
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,000
I was working since I was a little kid I

805
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,058
worked to make the commercial Greenhouse

806
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,159
industry and I

807
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:58,558
was kind of I went to the kind of the

808
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,020
top top AG or Horticulture School in

809
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,240
Canada and it was kind of at that time I

810
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:04,980
was doing like a lot of dead shows and I

811
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,679
was so I was hanging around with like

812
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,900
kind of dead head crowd in that

813
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,019
University

814
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:16,259
and one of my roommates was a big

815
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:18,058
wholesaler and I think just that was

816
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,798
like the whatever Holy Trinity or

817
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:21,960
whatever you call it of things where

818
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:25,200
that my friend the wholesaler kind of

819
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,120
knew everybody in town so our house was

820
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,460
kind of like a I don't know what you'd

821
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,619
call it anything good weed wise was

822
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,000
coming that was coming through town was

823
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,859
through our house like so all the

824
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,298
Growers would come there and you just

825
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:40,079
kind of knew everybody it was all

826
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:42,480
through like the Dead scene largely and

827
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,058
and just because I had all the all that

828
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,380
commercial Greenhouse experience I kind

829
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:48,359
of always got sucked in with a lot of

830
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,460
those guys because I kind of you know

831
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,839
came from commercial uh Greenhouse

832
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,058
flowers and veg

833
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,819
and out of there somehow I ended up

834
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,319
working on the side for uh cannabis

835
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:00,058
Canada which was called at the time it's

836
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,278
the same magazine Canada's cannabis

837
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:03,538
Canada had turned into cannabis culture

838
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:05,398
eventually and it was really like an

839
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:06,599
activist magazine so that was back in

840
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:09,479
like the dark days you weren't allowed

841
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,099
to really do anything there and love

842
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,778
them or hate him Mark Emery was the guy

843
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,459
that owned that magazine and he did I

844
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:16,980
don't particularly like the guy but uh

845
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,620
he there's no question he did a lot of

846
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,179
major bid for Canada's cannabis laws and

847
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,619
some other stuff so he was really

848
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,538
pushing the boundaries and that was his

849
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,099
magazine and that's where if you hear

850
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:27,839
people talking about Emery seeds and

851
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:30,599
that it was all sold out of the magazine

852
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,459
but it was very much like a it was an

853
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:36,538
activist magazine

854
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:39,000
um and it was really about you gotta

855
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:40,200
remember that that if you frame that I

856
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,798
don't think a lot of people realized but

857
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,960
at that point in time BC specifically

858
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,898
was kind it was BC in Amsterdam where

859
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,700
the two epicenters of cannabis in the in

860
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:52,939
the world California was still really

861
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,500
this is kind of like late night 90s

862
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,720
California was still locked down pretty

863
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,000
hard so everyone was not it wasn't even

864
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,100
though it was a major player nobody was

865
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,558
talking of it an international scene so

866
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:06,658
it was BC was kind of the Centric and

867
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,879
Mark Henry's kind of a big egomaniac so

868
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:10,559
he's kind of used that to promote his

869
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,700
stuff but I'm super proud of being

870
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,639
involved in that I think it really

871
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,558
pushed the boundaries and uh

872
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,259
so basically kind of my Niche there was

873
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,599
I kind of just took what I was learning

874
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,220
from working and going to school and

875
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,719
being in the commercial industry mostly

876
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,220
from being in the commercial Greenhouse

877
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,319
industry and putting it into cannabis

878
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,960
and just taking like I kind of brought

879
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,879
like diff was a new thing back there so

880
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,399
I kind of you know write an article at

881
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,039
diff and uh a bunch of stuff like that

882
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,898
but basically taking just general

883
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:43,019
Horticulture things that was kind of the

884
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,879
Forefront of the you know Flora culture

885
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,398
or vegetable industry and bringing it

886
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,500
into the Cannabis world and then at the

887
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,719
same time Mark Cameron had this giant

888
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,099
Seed Catalog which was at the time the

889
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,620
only place in the world that you could

890
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:58,019
buy cannabis seeds from without flying

891
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:59,459
to Amsterdam so it was like this real

892
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,379
hot

893
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,538
um commodium man who knows how much

894
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,700
money he made off of that definitely a

895
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:07,079
lot but uh yeah that magazine I mean

896
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,179
High Times was always the biggest and

897
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,939
then we were the next biggest what up to

898
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,798
like quite a few million Maybe I'm Wrong

899
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,298
I Don't Remember the circulation but it

900
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,619
was a substantial circuit relation all

901
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:19,200
through the world

902
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,639
um and that was kind of but I said I

903
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,778
think it was a moment of time where a

904
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,580
lot of that stuff it was kind of before

905
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,679
the internet was big internet was around

906
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:27,960
but I think a lot of that stuff just got

907
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,179
replaced but it was good information at

908
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,679
that time that I was putting out but it

909
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,500
really quickly got replaced by like

910
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,419
overgrow and stuff like that but uh yeah

911
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,240
it was a crazy it was a crazy time like

912
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:44,278
we had we kind of reached a crescendo I

913
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,720
think it was 2003 or 2004 that this kind

914
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:48,839
of gives you an idea of like who these

915
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,298
sort of running this for that they were

916
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,500
just total activists and Dana Larson's

917
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:54,240
the guy that I really have a huge amount

918
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,339
of respect for that nobody talks about

919
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,620
but to me he's the biggest activist in

920
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:01,439
Canada ever and he was kind of you know

921
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:03,839
kept his head down a little bit but it

922
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,659
kind of reached this uh Crescendo when

923
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,278
at the time the DEA had just opened up

924
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:10,559
an office in Canada because they were

925
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,058
concerned with all the exporting going

926
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,298
on and stuff like that so they'd opened

927
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:18,298
up a office in Vancouver which is where

928
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:20,940
cannabis culture at the time was called

929
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:23,879
was based and

930
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,640
Mark Emery and Dana and I can't remember

931
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,320
a couple other people from the magazine

932
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,720
um the drug czar had actually come up to

933
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,639
Vancouver and was going to give like a

934
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,980
drug czar whatever speech or something

935
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,200
like a private function and these guys

936
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,759
actually bought a table at it without

937
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,980
people realizing there's a bunch of

938
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,898
activists in the front row and heckled

939
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,220
the drug czar through the whole thing

940
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:45,418
that was the time when I definitely

941
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,700
regretted being part of that

942
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,299
organization because I didn't sign up

943
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,399
for heckling the drug czar and uh

944
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:54,658
so the drugs are was at the time I don't

945
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,278
think knew who any of them were even

946
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:01,200
though Mark Emery was shipping seeds all

947
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:02,579
over the U.S like crazy and he from what

948
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
I confused together went home and said

949
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:05,278
who the heck are these people that

950
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,658
heckled me through the whole thing and

951
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,519
they're like oh that's you know Mark

952
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,619
Emery and Dana Larson and the biggest

953
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,480
seed sellers in the world and they sell

954
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:16,440
Over America and they

955
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:20,159
started a big dea you know investigation

956
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,740
of the whole magazine organization that

957
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,659
ended up in uh Mark Emery going to jail

958
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,398
and a bunch of uh

959
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,019
crazy stuff that went around I don't

960
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,299
think anyone knows exactly what happened

961
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,398
but it was definitely a little

962
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,560
heart-raising I added I had a situation

963
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,699
at that time which I'm sure it's not I'm

964
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,019
still not positive it's what's happened

965
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,000
but I'm pretty sure it's what happened

966
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:39,960
so at the time like I said I was based

967
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,480
in

968
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,000
Ontario so all the articles I was

969
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,500
writing were coming from

970
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
we're just being transmitted digitally

971
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,139
and at the time we didn't I just knew

972
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,659
they'd done this thing with the drug

973
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,300
czar and I was like like the sounds of

974
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,559
that but nothing everything was kind of

975
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,720
going smoothly and we've been operating

976
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:59,279
for quite a few years with no hassles

977
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:01,079
and

978
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,940
all of a sudden all this wonky stuff

979
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,159
started coming like I was going back and

980
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,139
forth between Dana was the editor at the

981
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,699
time and I was sending him articles and

982
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:10,319
he kept coming back and I didn't get the

983
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:12,239
article and I was like what the heck

984
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,280
there's a bunch of wonky stuff where we

985
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,799
couldn't transmit emails which looking

986
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,900
back was clearly we know that the DEA

987
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,519
was on the servers like looking through

988
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,220
stuff I think I'm sure it was something

989
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,259
to do with that and uh I used to send

990
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,379
them all through uh like from an

991
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,599
internet whatever you call them Cafe so

992
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,099
it couldn't get traced to me and I was

993
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,780
usually I was pretty paranoid back then

994
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:35,039
so I'd always move around a little bit

995
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,500
but I guess I don't know I get

996
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,079
complacent and I kept every Friday

997
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,239
afternoon or not everybody that it was

998
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,560
like a specific time kind of you know

999
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,179
whatever four o'clock on a Friday

1000
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,059
afternoon I'd stop by the same internet

1001
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:50,519
cafe and transmit the article or

1002
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:52,019
whatever we were communicating a bit and

1003
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:54,239
then so one day I'm sitting there and I

1004
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:56,338
was the only person in the cafe

1005
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,139
and all of a sudden bang the door comes

1006
00:35:56,338 --> 00:36:00,299
open and this cop looking guy comes in

1007
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:02,879
and he walks right past you know about

1008
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,640
50 computer Terminals and goes right to

1009
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,539
me and like looks over and I was like

1010
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:11,039
that seems a little sketch and he left

1011
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:14,460
and I was like okay well whatever it's

1012
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,380
probably being paranoid and uh

1013
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,599
two minutes later Ben and he comes again

1014
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,599
with another guy that looks like a cop

1015
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,099
and they come straight for my like where

1016
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,039
I'm sitting there's nobody else there so

1017
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:29,099
I kind of got up and was super paranoid

1018
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:31,019
back there so I was I was uh parked with

1019
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,400
three parking lots away in kind of a

1020
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:35,039
busy area

1021
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,420
and so I just I first started walking

1022
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,338
and I was like holy cow like they're

1023
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,838
actually like coming after me so it

1024
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:41,578
ended up with me running through this

1025
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,679
parking lot you know dodging cars like

1026
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,359
it was in a movie with these two you

1027
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,118
know undercover cop looking people

1028
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,159
chasing me and I got away and thought

1029
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,019
it's kind of like I don't know it sure

1030
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,179
felt like that was like the DEA or

1031
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:56,280
something but it seemed so crazy like to

1032
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,838
be staking at an internet cafe

1033
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,460
um and then like two weeks later they

1034
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,858
arrested they took down Mark Emery and

1035
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,119
arrested him and extradited him and a

1036
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:05,219
bunch of other people so I think it

1037
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,800
probably was we'll never know for sure

1038
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:09,838
but like it was a something I'm totally

1039
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,599
proud of I think it was instrumental in

1040
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,059
changing kidney I think Canada and the

1041
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:17,338
U.S laws I was always a big believer in

1042
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:19,259
genetics of just that was always the

1043
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,299
limiting factor of there wasn't enough

1044
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,800
genetics or at the time know-how of how

1045
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,780
to grow stuff so I really believed in

1046
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,000
just spreading genetics spreading the

1047
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:30,000
know-how of how to do stuff and I really

1048
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,800
think that in the U.S that's under I

1049
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,239
don't think they realize how much that

1050
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,740
probably made a difference because you

1051
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,719
couldn't get seeds other than from that

1052
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:37,919
organization it really for I don't

1053
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,539
remember how many years it's probably

1054
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,960
like six or seven years it really just

1055
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,400
flooded the world with high quality

1056
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,740
cannabis genetics so I'm super proud of

1057
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,300
uh super proud of that not super proud

1058
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,799
of really being associated with Mark

1059
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,760
Emery but whatever he did some good

1060
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,220
things

1061
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,619
you mentioned that like for a good chunk

1062
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:57,118
of time say five six years as you said

1063
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,980
um you know Mark was really the one

1064
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,079
flooding the world with genetics I guess

1065
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,420
I'd be interested to hear do you feel

1066
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,039
like a lot of what he stocked was good

1067
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,720
quality and was what it says it was

1068
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,820
because I always remember back to that

1069
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,338
breed of Steve's story where he rocks up

1070
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,200
with the sweet skunk and Mark was like

1071
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:15,059
whatever we'll just call it Scentsy big

1072
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,858
bud or like is sweet skunk or like

1073
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,900
whatever it was and I was just like oh

1074
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:20,519
okay like maybe it was a bit more like

1075
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,320
you know just whack a name on whatever

1076
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,940
or like what was your take do you think

1077
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,640
it was pretty above board or it was a

1078
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,139
bit like just whatever works uh I think

1079
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,960
it was a bit of both I think it was

1080
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:33,059
mostly uh like so how that started from

1081
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,260
what I remember is Mark he was

1082
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:37,139
originally everything was just coming

1083
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,579
out of Amsterdam and he had a guy

1084
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,239
um I won't say his name but there was a

1085
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:45,480
guy that was working over there was

1086
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,858
living over there that was kind of uh

1087
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,119
um I don't know what exactly he was

1088
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,980
doing here but he was shipping he was

1089
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,280
just buying seeds and

1090
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,900
and moving them to Mark and then he was

1091
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,420
just reselling you know like at the time

1092
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,880
it was like Sagar maratha and Sensi and

1093
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,880
uh Dutch all the original kind of Dutch

1094
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,440
ones and

1095
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,660
then that guy was actually one of the

1096
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,440
guys that came back I believe and

1097
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:11,639
started the BC Seed Company and there

1098
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,440
was a bunch of stuff like that but there

1099
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,838
was a whole lot of knockoffs so that was

1100
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,639
basically Mark started off selling you

1101
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,739
know Dutch genetics and any I think just

1102
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,659
figured oh crap you can

1103
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:23,219
um just knock off this stuff and then so

1104
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,960
nobody really cared most people didn't

1105
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:27,059
really know enough to care they just

1106
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,500
were like oh it's Northern Lights but

1107
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:31,019
um yeah I think a whole lot of it was

1108
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,579
just like f2s from a 10 pack but there

1109
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:34,320
was definitely some good work like weird

1110
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,420
Steve definitely did some real

1111
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,920
work but I mean to put it in context I

1112
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,559
always not to

1113
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,180
at the at the time I remember like this

1114
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,739
is way back in the early days when Steve

1115
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,598
first get it started I remember we kind

1116
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:48,179
of used to laugh at home because it had

1117
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,160
in the in the write-up it was like you

1118
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:52,019
know his breeding operation under two

1119
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,059
400 watt lights like it literally said

1120
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:56,039
it in the in the breathing in the

1121
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,900
company description like so that's how

1122
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,219
stuff started and he definitely you know

1123
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,980
disappeared Steve I think the guy did

1124
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:04,078
submit some massive work but that was

1125
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,019
kind of the context is like how big were

1126
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,720
these places and also keep in mind like

1127
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:11,338
the average size for grows back it was

1128
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,858
Tiny compared to what we're used to like

1129
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:16,440
where I was from like before lighter was

1130
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:18,659
pretty much as much as most people ran

1131
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,059
10 10 lights was definitely unless you

1132
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:22,980
were like organized crime a 10 lighter

1133
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:25,320
was a big deal and then if you were out

1134
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,639
in BC 10 lighters were a little bit more

1135
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,980
common and there was definitely like

1136
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,598
some 30 or 40 and some big ones but I

1137
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,940
would say the average grow at that time

1138
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,519
in Canada was four lights so you know

1139
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,838
how much breeding was actually you know

1140
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,338
how much real breeding was actually

1141
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:39,539
going on

1142
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:40,920
um I think there is definitely some

1143
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:43,739
interesting stuff came out of there but

1144
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,900
there was also a ton of like just

1145
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,879
um knockoffs that came at a pretty small

1146
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,740
population sizes but I would say like

1147
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,320
there's definitely some unique Canadian

1148
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,699
genetics that got spread around the

1149
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,859
world like Mighty might that I already

1150
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:57,719
talked about came out of there text a

1151
00:40:55,858 --> 00:41:01,199
lot of time work which is a you know was

1152
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:03,719
a super to Me instrumental outdoor

1153
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,358
strain UBC chemo which was one of the

1154
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,219
early I'm pretty sure it was like a

1155
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:09,838
Canadian bread you know not related to

1156
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:11,819
Dutch genetics there's definitely some

1157
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,440
interesting stuff that came out of there

1158
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,119
and got spread through that seed bank

1159
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,039
for sure but there was also a lot of

1160
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,420
just generic crap there's lots of great

1161
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,980
stuff came out of that generic crap too

1162
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,358
like I've I grew out the best Northern

1163
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,639
Lights I've ever

1164
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,920
um grown just came out of one of those

1165
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:28,379
packs and I'm sure it was just a F2 from

1166
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,200
Level stuff or something

1167
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,599
yeah nice and out of curiosity have you

1168
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,819
been following any of the Northern

1169
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,059
Lights re-releases from say Todd

1170
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,099
McCormick or inspector Matt ride and

1171
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:43,559
have they picked your interest at all or

1172
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,519
not particularly uh yeah I followed it

1173
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,779
I'm interested but I also remember

1174
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:50,338
I think people that's one of those ones

1175
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,619
that people view through rose-colored

1176
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:54,659
glasses that most northern lights at the

1177
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,440
time it was it was totally like the

1178
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,319
whatever they call it the

1179
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,019
state-of-the-art modern indoor indica

1180
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,240
and it was but if you compare it if I

1181
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:05,338
had to take most of the most of the

1182
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:06,539
Northern Lights was pretty generic

1183
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:08,039
um so I'm really interested to see what

1184
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:10,440
comes out of that because I definitely

1185
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,199
tried some a couple of really good

1186
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,700
Northern Lights but I also I grew a lot

1187
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,159
of different Northern Lights during that

1188
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,960
early 90s period and most of them were

1189
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,519
just we'd call them mids these days like

1190
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,420
they weren't anything special they were

1191
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:23,400
just like

1192
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,960
the hash plants

1193
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,980
um so I'm interested to see what comes

1194
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,220
out of that

1195
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,960
but I I'm not buying any packs of seeds

1196
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,659
anytime soon

1197
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,059
yeah okay I mean hey you've just piqued

1198
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:38,699
my interest if I

1199
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:40,440
this is a weird situation right but if I

1200
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:42,299
put a gun to your head and I said you

1201
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,338
have to buy a pack of seeds right now

1202
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,839
like what ones are you gonna get like in

1203
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:47,338
terms of like what what would you get if

1204
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:51,119
you were gonna get one

1205
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:53,099
what what interests you right now uh

1206
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,380
I really I'm actually a fan of like some

1207
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,180
of the stuff CSI Humboldt's got going I

1208
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,640
really like those I'm really a I love

1209
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:02,519
that Elite kindly Elite or Elite clone

1210
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,239
S1 stuff I'd probably try like

1211
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:05,639
um

1212
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:07,559
probably maybe some of the I'm kind of

1213
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,818
like not so dog headband I like the

1214
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:10,019
sound of some of the headbands I've

1215
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:11,338
tried some really good headbands and you

1216
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,838
gotta remember in Canada

1217
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,659
it's gotten a lot better but we

1218
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:18,960
generally don't get most of the

1219
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,279
Elite clones are are BS right it's like

1220
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,720
it's a cookies clone and you get it

1221
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,280
you're like this is anything even remote

1222
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:24,779
recurves it's just it's gotten better

1223
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,519
now it's gotten legal that some of the

1224
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,099
real cuts are going over but generally

1225
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:31,318
we didn't get any of that stuff so I've

1226
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,960
tried a lot of Cam I've never tried the

1227
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,579
actual clones I've tried a lot of Girl

1228
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,318
Scout cookies I've never tried the

1229
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,640
actual girl scout cookies clone I don't

1230
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,559
think I think it might have made of

1231
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,818
there's a lot of stuff like that so if I

1232
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,799
was gonna buy seeds it'd probably be

1233
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:45,960
something like uh

1234
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,160
probably a headband

1235
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,199
um

1236
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:52,858
maybe one of the

1237
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:54,539
A5 type things it's going on A5 Haze but

1238
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,818
it would probably be like a headband or

1239
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:59,759
something like that

1240
00:43:56,818 --> 00:44:01,199
or also the also one of the oracles the

1241
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,359
one I've never tried that I've always

1242
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,039
wanted to is a is some of the oracles

1243
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,440
because I'd really like to see how that

1244
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,818
relates to a lot of the Canada purple

1245
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,019
cushions because I would leave that's

1246
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:12,019
it's probably related

1247
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:16,739
yeah definitely I have to agree CSI has

1248
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:19,619
been doing some cool stuff with his uh

1249
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:23,159
Femme stuff and I myself have a pack of

1250
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:26,220
the uh the headband cross lemon tree no

1251
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:27,118
sorry headband cross chemd it's gonna be

1252
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:28,919
fire

1253
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,358
that's exactly the same we're on the

1254
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,700
same page man that was just typically

1255
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:33,960
the one that I would probably uh go for

1256
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:35,279
if I had to but I don't buy a lot of

1257
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,079
seeds I'll never go through all the

1258
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,780
seeds I have in a lifetime anyways I

1259
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,359
just basically go through clones and

1260
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,700
stuff that gets gifted to me

1261
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:46,380
yeah nice that's that's cool to hear

1262
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:49,259
that you got a nice little stash there

1263
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,940
if I could just loop back to a point you

1264
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,920
made a bit earlier

1265
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,240
um just to clarify for myself and anyone

1266
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,400
listening

1267
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:59,279
um it sounds like you're sort of of the

1268
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,280
thought that uh that that heckling with

1269
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,740
that drugs are that talk may have been

1270
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,560
like you know the sort of catalyst that

1271
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:08,879
started the whole demise of Mark Emery

1272
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,219
is that sort of what you're getting at

1273
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,960
it was 100 there was no question if you

1274
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:15,480
look at the time frame it was literally

1275
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,460
a hundred percent what what uh happened

1276
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,960
there is no doubt at all and there are

1277
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,099
some other stuff which I don't want to

1278
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,960
get into because it's kind of here say

1279
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,640
but I wouldn't be surprised if there was

1280
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,400
actually like an undercover age and

1281
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:28,920
dropped into that organization at that

1282
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,260
time too it was like I don't think most

1283
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,579
people realize like how much of a threat

1284
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:37,020
that group was really perceived by the

1285
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:38,579
DEA at the time I think

1286
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:41,280
um but no there was Zero doubt that

1287
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:43,339
hacking the drugs are absolutely was the

1288
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,140
start of Mark every's divine

1289
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:48,358
there you go yeah a bit Brazen isn't it

1290
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:51,539
but nevertheless interesting stuff to

1291
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:54,078
hear for sure so something which we hear

1292
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:57,599
a lot about in the American history is

1293
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,280
how uh beneficial that the forums were

1294
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,838
to the scene how it promoted a lot of

1295
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,940
sharing of genetics things like that

1296
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:05,400
I've never really heard a perspective on

1297
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,318
how it affected the Canadian scene would

1298
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,000
you say that largely speaking it was the

1299
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:10,500
same as the US in that it was like

1300
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,420
groundbreaking you know you could get

1301
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,159
all this info people sharing genetics or

1302
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,920
would you say like less so of an effect

1303
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,879
than what the US saw

1304
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,500
um

1305
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,180
the information was definitely

1306
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,980
groundbreaking like that was I can

1307
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:25,199
totally remember like I was kind of

1308
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,000
around since I was never a giant Forum

1309
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,379
dude but I was I was on there and I was

1310
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,099
right from the start like I literally

1311
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,440
remember I can remember the first when

1312
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:36,240
overgrow

1313
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,579
launched I remember being there used to

1314
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:42,000
be another Forum called I think it was

1315
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:44,160
called weed base and it was on a server

1316
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,780
I think that it was I think it was on

1317
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,179
something called Laughing Moon which was

1318
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,560
I believe owned by Advanced Nutrients at

1319
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:51,838
the time before they were advanced

1320
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,400
nutrients and it was a real low-key

1321
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:54,838
forum and that was the Cannabis sport

1322
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,519
that was the biggest cannabis Forum in

1323
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,039
the world and I remember

1324
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,280
going on there one day and there was a

1325
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,318
post that said you are all going to jail

1326
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,819
um read this and get out or something

1327
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,318
like something crazy where you're in it

1328
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:08,639
was things were paranoid back there I'm

1329
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,460
like oh my God like and I remember

1330
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,019
clicking on it and it was shebang that

1331
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,539
basically was the guy that started

1332
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:16,500
overgrow was who posted it oh don't hold

1333
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:18,779
me this one I'm pretty sure it was

1334
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,980
shebang and it was directing you to this

1335
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,839
new site to overgrow.com and saying this

1336
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,380
was the safe place to go and I remember

1337
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:30,000
going on it then and you could literally

1338
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,980
go and that was the time that I was kind

1339
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,300
of writing for cannabis culture so you

1340
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,858
wanted to like keep up on all the latest

1341
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,500
what was going on and I remember

1342
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:39,659
overgrow was so small at that time that

1343
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,480
I could click through in like you know

1344
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:44,338
45 minutes and check every post that had

1345
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,440
gone on like that week or something in

1346
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:49,078
all the different subheadings and then

1347
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,059
within like from what I'm remembering it

1348
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,000
was literally like a couple of months it

1349
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:56,159
just like exploded so you couldn't even

1350
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,639
like follow the posts in like one sub

1351
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,019
for you know evening but there was a ton

1352
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:03,059
of information because it was just that

1353
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:04,679
was the first everyone's just locked in

1354
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:06,480
their own little bubble like my whole

1355
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,219
cannabis world back then was about 10

1356
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,039
people maybe 20 like you didn't even

1357
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:12,598
tell like you didn't even tell like your

1358
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,000
best friends that you grew like it was

1359
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:17,039
really tight and then the internet was

1360
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,818
kind of this weird thing where you could

1361
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,119
tell

1362
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:22,199
it just gave some and not anonymity and

1363
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,119
you'd be like holy cow all these other

1364
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,219
people are doing this stuff

1365
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,900
um and I would say for me I was already

1366
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:29,699
because I was always kind of on and off

1367
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,800
dead tour during that time period or

1368
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,118
just or in the 90s and that was kind of

1369
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,039
the original so I already had

1370
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,780
connections with way more people than

1371
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,940
the average Growers had because I'd meet

1372
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,519
all these Americans on you know on dead

1373
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,838
tour that were were into weed but the

1374
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,239
average person like you knew like

1375
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:47,039
whatever a couple of your local crew and

1376
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,858
and that was it but no that was

1377
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,858
absolutely game changing I I said I

1378
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:54,239
basically that's that and the DEA

1379
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:55,199
involvement that's the reason I stopped

1380
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:57,779
writing because I was like this is

1381
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,818
irrelevant once overgrow blew up I was

1382
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,859
like this writing is totally irrelevant

1383
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:03,659
it basically made magazines like that

1384
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:04,980
they come like you know Readers Digest

1385
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:06,420
or something

1386
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,760
um

1387
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,680
but no I think they were absolutely

1388
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,500
and I personally when I look back on

1389
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:15,179
that time period I think two things

1390
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,380
affected cannabis laws more than

1391
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:18,480
anything

1392
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,220
one was the internet specific like

1393
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,679
overgrow cannabis world that type of

1394
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:24,959
stuff just spreading the information and

1395
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,179
two was people like Mark Emery seeds

1396
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,519
just dosing the world with high quality

1397
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:31,259
uh cannabis genetics I honestly think

1398
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:35,179
those were the two pivotal things that

1399
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:38,880
pushed legalization forward

1400
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:41,460
yeah fantastic to hear that and out of

1401
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,559
curiosity do you believe that the forums

1402
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,119
would ever be able to make a comeback

1403
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,759
we've seen a lot of people pushing for

1404
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,039
it and a lot of people criticize the the

1405
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,740
sort of uh constant feed of Instagram

1406
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,139
but at the same time it doesn't seem

1407
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,879
like any of the forums have really got a

1408
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:58,199
lot of traction taking off do you think

1409
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,358
we'll ever go back or do you think

1410
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,399
Instagram's sort of here to stay

1411
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:04,259
I don't think we'll ever go back to the

1412
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,000
forums I do definitely miss parts of it

1413
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,619
where it definitely

1414
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,179
um

1415
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,800
I don't like this stuff with Instagram

1416
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:12,899
where stuff goes through so quickly

1417
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,280
where you used to be like for instance I

1418
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,420
know there's a thread on purple push

1419
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,339
there that I always remember and it's

1420
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,358
just like that was a classic there was a

1421
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:20,519
bunch of them like that but they were

1422
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:22,318
just classic threads where it's like it

1423
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,579
was like a thing on BC Purple Kush and

1424
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,039
there's a bunch of people you know

1425
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:28,140
posting and they're like it was sitting

1426
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:29,579
there you know active for probably a few

1427
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:31,739
years and you got some good information

1428
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:33,539
on it where now if you said something

1429
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:35,939
like that just like it's a 24-hour

1430
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:39,059
discussion and then it's it's just gone

1431
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,099
into the IG ABY this

1432
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:42,480
um so I have I kind of feel like it was

1433
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,859
a moment in time I don't think it's

1434
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,659
probably a

1435
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:46,739
coming back they're still I'd go on

1436
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:48,539
there every once in a while and there's

1437
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:49,979
still some discussions which seems like

1438
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:53,960
it's kind of some of the older dudes

1439
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:56,818
that never moved on to sell things

1440
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,800
yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's an

1441
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:00,119
interesting one I'm I'm like yourself it

1442
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,240
would be cool to see him come back but

1443
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:07,079
I'm not entirely sold myself uh but

1444
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:09,899
given we are in the sort of modern legal

1445
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,220
uh climate it'd be good to talk a little

1446
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,440
bit about that I know that you've

1447
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:15,659
transitioned your work over to the legal

1448
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,659
Market working in uh the Canadian

1449
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:20,879
cannabis industry shall we call it

1450
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:23,279
um what's that transition been like for

1451
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,200
you as someone who historically was you

1452
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,240
know doing their own thing

1453
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,739
um and now suddenly to be working around

1454
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,118
people it's all legal out in the open

1455
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:31,618
how's that been for you because I know

1456
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,318
that a lot of the American guys

1457
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,420
especially some of the big players even

1458
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:39,420
to this day they still really struggle

1459
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,800
to sort of act in a way that reflects

1460
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,119
how legal it is you know they're always

1461
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,920
still like sort of looking over their

1462
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,539
shoulder because of just the experiences

1463
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,159
would you say you've had a similar

1464
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,779
experience or is it a bit more casual

1465
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:50,879
for you

1466
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,440
similar so just to be clear like I kind

1467
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,300
of haven't been in the commercial scene

1468
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,858
for a long time I'm kind of one of those

1469
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,000
people that I've been around I think

1470
00:51:55,858 --> 00:51:59,159
most people know me just because I've

1471
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,318
been around for a long time

1472
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:03,239
um I and I rolled with a lot of some of

1473
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,460
my friends were pretty

1474
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,199
um hardcore I've always kind of kept my

1475
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,420
head down so it's been a long time since

1476
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,699
I was like

1477
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:13,800
actively involved in the in the

1478
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:16,199
commercial scene so my kind of thing is

1479
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,300
I've kind of always been around it on

1480
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,639
different levels

1481
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,859
um but I've never been like it's been a

1482
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,299
long time since I've been like uh you

1483
00:52:22,858 --> 00:52:26,519
know a baller

1484
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,019
um and

1485
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,000
I've kind of I've worked in the

1486
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:32,818
greenhouse industry so on both sides so

1487
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,619
I've kind of seen watch this I'm kind of

1488
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:36,119
I think a what's an arm's length

1489
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,318
Observer so I wasn't I didn't really

1490
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,940
have anything invested they weren't

1491
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:42,300
taking I wasn't making a living from the

1492
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,818
Cannabis industry so I

1493
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,099
whatever wasn't hurting me seeing the

1494
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:49,558
legal stuff I I like I really like

1495
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:51,720
seeing people not going to jail like I

1496
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:55,140
think you can't lose sight of that I've

1497
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:58,379
seen so many people's lives over the

1498
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:59,879
time just completely destroyed I had one

1499
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,980
of my second my second closest friend

1500
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,099
committed suicide and it was

1501
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,599
um as far as I'm concerned as a Fallout

1502
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,180
from being arrested and just having for

1503
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,818
growing at the time it was a 600 water

1504
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:13,500
and he was on the front page of the like

1505
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:17,099
basically a personal group front page of

1506
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,659
the newspaper for a week or two the you

1507
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,039
know tax people coming out fight

1508
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:22,159
haunting them for years and they

1509
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,358
destroyed his life over a 600 watt

1510
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:27,179
garden and he ended up killing himself

1511
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,858
and I saw so many stories like that that

1512
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,179
I just think it's important that

1513
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:32,639
everyone keeps

1514
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:34,199
that in the front there's a lot of lives

1515
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,118
ruined there's still people sitting in

1516
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:36,779
jail for stuff like that

1517
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,240
um

1518
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,160
and I do find it

1519
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,199
it doesn't really there's a lot of stuff

1520
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:44,699
that I don't like about it so I kind of

1521
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:46,019
said I work

1522
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:47,219
um I don't work for one of the

1523
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:48,719
facilities like we're kind of work in

1524
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:50,279
like supplying and Consulting some of

1525
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,098
the silly so I've seen pretty much most

1526
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,819
of them across Canada and the thing I

1527
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:58,800
think that stands out the most to me is

1528
00:53:55,818 --> 00:54:01,679
what saddens me about it is especially

1529
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,359
in BC there's a lot of cool places to

1530
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,299
live in British Columbia

1531
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,920
um like that don't have any jobs so but

1532
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,019
traditionally like basically since back

1533
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,519
in you know back in the 70s but

1534
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:13,800
especially since like the late 80s when

1535
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,300
they endure stuff took off that's what

1536
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,460
paid for people to live in these

1537
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,260
beautiful spots like the Kootenays which

1538
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,880
is like the interior BC or up on the

1539
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,220
Sunshine Coast which is like north of

1540
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,900
Vancouver or Vancouver Island there was

1541
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:26,459
no jobs there but you could make a

1542
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,400
living running a 10 lighter or something

1543
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,960
like that and that's pretty much done

1544
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,000
there's still people doing it but it's

1545
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,400
getting really hard and that I find is

1546
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,380
that saddens me for sure and I think

1547
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,960
that was a really great part of like

1548
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,400
Canadian culture and you've seen I've

1549
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,980
seen firsthand in some of those areas

1550
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:48,420
that were kind of black market-centric

1551
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:50,280
spots and also the big licensed producer

1552
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,539
opens up there and these guys went from

1553
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,859
making you know a lot of people weren't

1554
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:55,318
getting rich in canvas they were making

1555
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:57,179
like you know 80 or 100 000 a year or

1556
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:58,858
something like that tax free and then

1557
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:01,078
all of a sudden they're making you know

1558
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:03,299
fifty thousand dollars and paying tax so

1559
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,220
their wages just kind of got cut in a

1560
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,900
quarter and then you know this is the

1561
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:09,358
money's not going into the local economy

1562
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,639
anymore the money's going somewhere else

1563
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,558
so that that I really find

1564
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:14,578
um saddening but

1565
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,380
um

1566
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:17,640
overall like I'm pretty positive about

1567
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,200
it I think it kind of went through a bit

1568
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:20,578
of a dead zone off the start where it

1569
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,960
just went really corporate and then

1570
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:23,280
there's kind of a second wave coming

1571
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,559
where I've got like I've got a bunch of

1572
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,240
good buddies that run licensed places

1573
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:29,400
that are doing okay and they're like

1574
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:30,719
legit dudes like they I think they

1575
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,818
really love what they're doing and

1576
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,858
they're not super corporate

1577
00:55:32,818 --> 00:55:37,500
um but it is what it is at least

1578
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:40,679
nobody's going to jail anymore

1579
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,659
yeah hugely that's uh actually a really

1580
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:44,219
relevant Point I've been trying to talk

1581
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:46,139
to people about because you see a lot of

1582
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:49,259
sentiment these days about

1583
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:50,639
people feeling really frustrated that as

1584
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,160
you said you know they can no longer

1585
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:56,818
pull 100k from their Garden it's now 50.

1586
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:58,618
and a lot of them get really frustrated

1587
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:00,119
um about that and complain about the

1588
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:02,220
laws and or we should have never gone

1589
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,900
legal blah blah blah but as you said at

1590
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:06,959
the end of the day keeping people out of

1591
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,818
jail or sadly in the case of your friend

1592
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,139
you know committing suicide I mean I

1593
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:12,300
know that that's not entirely related

1594
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:15,779
but keeping people out of jail should be

1595
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:17,519
the number one metric of success and it

1596
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,380
is unfortunate that people's livelihoods

1597
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,900
are affected but

1598
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,539
um yeah it is good that we can hopefully

1599
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,880
keep people from being put in prison for

1600
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:28,440
just growing a plant really

1601
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,180
yeah and I think you got to keep it in

1602
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,579
perspective I mean why were people able

1603
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:34,558
to go make you know make a whole bunch

1604
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,359
of money you know living in some cool

1605
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,519
spot where there's no jobs just because

1606
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:40,739
that's what you were paying for

1607
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:42,659
you know the risk and the risk is gone I

1608
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:44,338
mean it wasn't because they were

1609
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:47,219
mastered Growers or anything a lot of

1610
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:50,099
the time it was because they were you

1611
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:51,598
know risking going to jail and I think a

1612
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:53,940
lot of them lost

1613
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,338
um you know lost sight of that and you

1614
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,139
saw a lot of people that also you know I

1615
00:56:56,338 --> 00:57:00,000
have a couple of friends that you know

1616
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:01,139
they're kind of genetics Geeks and

1617
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,639
they've always got all the most elite

1618
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:04,318
clones and and I think they really

1619
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:05,879
thought everybody and they do have some

1620
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,199
of the nicest weed around and I think

1621
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,000
they really thought

1622
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,039
everybody was buying from them because

1623
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,480
they had you know these super Elite cuts

1624
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,818
and they were a great grower and then

1625
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,960
when they found it real quick was 90 of

1626
00:57:14,818 --> 00:57:18,179
the people were buying from them because

1627
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,679
they had wheat and there were a lot of

1628
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:21,419
people just don't care about weed as

1629
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,159
much as you or I do and they're just

1630
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,159
like whatever's cheapest and those guys

1631
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:28,199
went down pretty uh pretty quick sad but

1632
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:31,219
whatever that's that's

1633
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:34,019
kind of what you know the world's like

1634
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:36,058
yeah exactly and it's you know it's

1635
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:37,739
about evolving with the times and I

1636
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,859
still see a lot of people who are able

1637
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:42,838
to you know um diversify their income

1638
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:44,759
streams and still stay in the Cannabis

1639
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:46,619
industry I'd be interested in hearing

1640
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,319
though you referenced how some of the

1641
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:51,539
big uh companies that initially invested

1642
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:53,099
in the Canadian scene uh sort of went

1643
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:56,400
defunct and now there's like the second

1644
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:58,380
wave what's it like now do you think

1645
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,660
that a lot of the big AG has realized

1646
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:02,640
look we can't just come in here and make

1647
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:04,500
a bajillion dollars like we were hoping

1648
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,318
to it's actually a sort of a technically

1649
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,940
challenging operation do you think that

1650
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:10,619
we're gonna see like a scaled back

1651
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,200
corporate version of it or do you think

1652
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:15,240
that people will come in buy out these

1653
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,338
defunct facilities that are now for sale

1654
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,019
like you know Pennies on the dollar and

1655
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:21,139
they'll try to do it right how do you

1656
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:23,639
foresee the Canadian scene going forward

1657
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:26,219
uh I think I'll probably be driving

1658
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:27,960
around showing my grandkids one day he's

1659
00:58:26,219 --> 00:58:30,000
rusted out all the greenhouses and

1660
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,880
warehouses and telling them the story

1661
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,480
about office you know the crazy cannabis

1662
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,160
boom that never really materialized

1663
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,780
um I think just to be clear if you can

1664
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,838
look at what actually happened in Canada

1665
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:45,298
a lot of it wasn't big AG money or

1666
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:47,338
anything like that it was investment

1667
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:50,280
money so for instance

1668
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:51,838
um like the you know some of those big

1669
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,480
ones like

1670
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,578
um they came on and it was a

1671
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,679
it was his investment thing and like for

1672
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,000
instance the town that I grew up in

1673
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:00,960
um or didn't grow but I've lived in for

1674
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,280
a long time

1675
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,858
um there was a big facility opened up

1676
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,140
there and

1677
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:08,578
people started and I knew a bunch of

1678
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:10,920
people that literally became like

1679
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:12,240
millionaires you know invested you know

1680
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,280
a hundred thousand dollars and all of a

1681
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,199
sudden they're sitting on 1.2 million

1682
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,940
um they just blew up and then all their

1683
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:20,098
friends were like holy cow like yield

1684
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,659
this made a million dollars on the 30

1685
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,640
million dollar investment with this LP

1686
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:25,558
so then they all invested their money so

1687
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:27,779
it was really driven by just the average

1688
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,540
person all trying to cash in on this

1689
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,859
jackpot and you know I was one of them I

1690
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:35,099
made a bunch of money off the start and

1691
00:59:31,858 --> 00:59:37,139
I lost it off the long term

1692
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:38,880
um but that's kind of what drove it it

1693
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:40,858
wasn't a lot of like big money it was a

1694
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,059
whole bunch of Average Joe's dumping

1695
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:45,239
their money and not knowing what they

1696
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:46,798
were investing in and then I think what

1697
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:48,058
happened is these people just had you

1698
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:49,679
know it was I don't remember I never

1699
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:51,540
followed it that closely but it was like

1700
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,159
you know hundreds I mean the one place

1701
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:55,318
you know just one of the facilities was

1702
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:57,719
worth 150 million dollars and they had

1703
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:59,519
like you know three of that size and all

1704
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,098
of them are shuttered but there was just

1705
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,780
it didn't make any sense like I remember

1706
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,519
um myself and one of the other guys had

1707
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,500
kind of been around nothing the Cannabis

1708
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:10,019
world but just in that you know the

1709
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,760
Horticulture Greenhouse world for a long

1710
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:12,960
time and we we're doing the math and I

1711
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,680
was like I don't know I'm thinking maybe

1712
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,420
40 acres could supply all of Canada and

1713
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:20,219
then it was I think at one point we were

1714
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:22,440
like over a thousand or something it was

1715
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:24,539
just crazy it didn't make any sense but

1716
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,179
nobody was really thinking about it they

1717
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:28,619
were just like well we've got you know a

1718
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:30,239
billion dollars to spend that all these

1719
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,260
investors gave us so we better spend it

1720
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:33,479
and they were trying to I think there

1721
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,400
was a lot of fight for whoever had the

1722
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,039
biggest production space was going to

1723
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,260
win and what's really proved out is

1724
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:41,940
those people all failed and now the

1725
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,819
second wave is kind of it's still

1726
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:47,460
investors but it's a lot of stuff like

1727
01:00:43,818 --> 01:00:49,139
uh oil and gas decided to you know put

1728
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,139
you know put some money into these much

1729
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:53,759
smaller facilities or some of the

1730
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:55,618
um First Nations

1731
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,079
um like the native Indian bands you know

1732
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:59,420
Hudson cash have put it in more stuff

1733
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,280
like that and they're much more

1734
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,960
realistic like they're smaller

1735
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,900
um they're not so ridiculous with all

1736
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,699
the regulations and it it makes much

1737
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,680
more sense the second wave but I think

1738
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:13,019
for sure a lot of that first wave is

1739
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:14,578
just gonna like rust or I don't know

1740
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:15,420
maybe it's going to grow cucumbers or

1741
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,619
something I don't even know what they're

1742
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,240
gonna do with some of those facilities

1743
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:19,858
but it was Jeff it was definitely like

1744
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,659
it was kind of like the gold boom it's

1745
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:24,598
that type of thing happened

1746
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:26,098
yeah yeah certainly I was thinking.com

1747
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:29,880
boom but you're right I guess the Gold

1748
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:31,859
Rush exactly or.com or.com same thing

1749
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,260
yeah yeah a lot of parallels there

1750
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:35,880
that's really interesting so I guess

1751
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,119
from your sort of professional

1752
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,880
experience when you go to large

1753
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,400
facilities what are some of the big

1754
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,079
issues you see that are stopping them

1755
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,460
well maybe not the ones you visit but

1756
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,380
just in general like what are some of

1757
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,179
the hurdles that a large producer is

1758
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,039
going to come across that are going to

1759
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:54,539
get in the way of them producing top

1760
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,519
quality product because I'm assuming

1761
01:01:54,539 --> 01:01:57,420
they're all coming in going yeah you

1762
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,980
know we're going to run these

1763
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,159
greenhouses it's all going to be like

1764
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:03,780
the AAA plus the best on the market and

1765
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:05,519
then maybe it doesn't pan out that way

1766
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:07,798
what are some of the issues they have to

1767
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,000
overcome uh the issue is now are a bit

1768
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:10,619
different like before when they first

1769
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,119
started you'd go in and be like oh my

1770
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:13,798
goodness they literally didn't have a

1771
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:15,539
clue what they were doing some of them

1772
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:17,460
um like it was horrible

1773
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:20,940
um now I would say most of them are

1774
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:24,659
pretty good the issue that I see the

1775
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:26,818
most is it's just each it's just the the

1776
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:29,279
pro it's the difference between all the

1777
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:30,798
black market guys not to dismay my black

1778
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,000
market Brothers

1779
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,380
but they're all you know those legal

1780
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,119
guys don't know what they're doing and

1781
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,760
and I'm like I've been in the black

1782
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,440
market guys places more than most and

1783
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,000
I've been in the legal ones and honestly

1784
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,280
a lot of those legal stuff looks better

1785
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,900
than the black market when it comes down

1786
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,420
um and the facility like so they've just

1787
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,400
got great facilities it looks great and

1788
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:53,400
I haven't I just had literally a place

1789
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,500
that I was at this week that I have seen

1790
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,079
I would consider the top grower in

1791
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,659
Canada for the legal place like just

1792
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,339
absolutely gorgeous product I've seen it

1793
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:03,838
come down I've seen it on the dry table

1794
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:06,599
I'm like this looks amazing this is

1795
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:09,119
unbelievably high quality weed and then

1796
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:11,460
I go to the legal store and buy the

1797
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,280
exact batch that I bought and it's not

1798
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:17,159
that great and I think the difference is

1799
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,260
mostly age where it's just by the time

1800
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:23,039
you know they cure it and send it out

1801
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:24,839
for Quality tests and THC tasks to get

1802
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,420
the results back and then get it up into

1803
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:29,159
the you know the pipeline the

1804
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,380
distribution Pipeline and then somebody

1805
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:33,659
you know the middleman buys it and then

1806
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,818
the end store buys it and then it sits

1807
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:38,279
in inventory in the store before the end

1808
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:40,500
user buys it I don't know how long that

1809
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,480
cycle is but it's definitely way longer

1810
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,880
than the black market and when I see it

1811
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,579
I'm like this this looks like old weed

1812
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,680
it looks like no different than good

1813
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:52,140
weed that I grew and stuck in a jar for

1814
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:54,838
you know a year or a good weed that my

1815
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:56,219
friend was a black market grower did the

1816
01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:57,719
same thing it just looks like old weed

1817
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:59,459
so for sure I think that's the number

1818
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:01,439
one thing and maybe there's stuff like

1819
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,599
you know flashing it with you know

1820
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,338
nitrogen gas and stuff like that it's

1821
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,900
just oxidized weed

1822
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:10,199
um I think there's a lot of other stuff

1823
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,480
in there but uh that's for sure in my

1824
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:13,980
opinion the top one and then the other

1825
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,719
one I'm just like for God's sake

1826
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:18,838
somebody grows something other than like

1827
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:20,039
wedding cake Crashers or nothing not to

1828
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:22,318
diss it I think those are great strange

1829
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:24,119
but it's just like everything's the same

1830
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:27,779
like there's not a whole lot of unique

1831
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:29,460
stuff out there and I'm

1832
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,900
yeah it could definitely they could

1833
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:34,019
widen the pallet but I guess they just

1834
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,338
do what the the market sells but growing

1835
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:37,380
wise a lot of them are really on point

1836
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:40,199
they get I get I think they get unfairly

1837
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,400
uh uh smashed these days I think they're

1838
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:45,358
doing a good job

1839
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,880
yeah nice and out of curiosity what are

1840
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,338
some of the really popular strains in

1841
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,380
the facilities at the moment

1842
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:54,239
oh man I honestly don't even bother

1843
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,400
keeping track I just I just call them

1844
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,558
like glitter cookies it's just all

1845
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,818
different versions of cookies which I

1846
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,059
you know I like cookies they're not

1847
01:04:59,818 --> 01:05:05,279
dissing it but to me it all almost 100

1848
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:07,079
of it just likes like different versions

1849
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,740
of cookies

1850
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:10,380
um

1851
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:12,000
like I said buy cookies I mean also all

1852
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,858
the I don't keep track of all the

1853
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,900
gelatos and wedding cake I just consider

1854
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:17,699
all that coming out of that you know

1855
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,318
cookie family

1856
01:05:17,699 --> 01:05:20,338
um type stuff but all that you know

1857
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:23,460
purple

1858
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:25,558
dense glitter weed

1859
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,179
um

1860
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:29,040
there's a yeah I don't know it

1861
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:30,419
definitely just seems to Center on there

1862
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,818
but I honestly I'm not the best person

1863
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:34,380
to ask about the legal Market because

1864
01:05:32,818 --> 01:05:36,058
I've literally bought from the legal

1865
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,740
Market about like two times in my entire

1866
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:39,480
life I've Just Seen I've seen a lot of

1867
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,739
it grown and I've seen the occasional

1868
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,380
thing that one of my friends will buy

1869
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:45,058
but my whole most of my like crowd is

1870
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,880
highly insulated even though I see it

1871
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:49,440
all the time all my all the stuff I

1872
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,539
generally smoke or my friend smoke is

1873
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,980
all black market or just home grower

1874
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:56,159
stuff

1875
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:59,519
yeah nice love to hear it love to hear

1876
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,739

1877
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:03,780
now I would love to ask you because I've

1878
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:06,179
been following this myself so I'm sure

1879
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:10,319
others are Keen as well you've done some

1880
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:12,239
killer looking GMO sweet skunk hybrids I

1881
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,818
think you created them yourself would

1882
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:17,039
you be able to give us a bit of info on

1883
01:06:14,818 --> 01:06:19,079
um how those turned out it sounds like a

1884
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:22,019
great Cross of like new school meets old

1885
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:25,019
school how did it go yeah that was kind

1886
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:25,858
of my plan so it was just I said

1887
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:27,480
um

1888
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:29,279
I really like some of those well like

1889
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,719
sort of for one of your listeners like

1890
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,200
sweet skunkers

1891
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:36,239
debatable whether it's a nl5 so it for

1892
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:38,939
sure sweet's fun comes back to about

1893
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,019
1994 so which is kind of like back in

1894
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,579
the

1895
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:43,500
um Naval days and we know for sure it

1896
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:45,298
had Northern Lights it's for sure

1897
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,260
Northern Lights hazy

1898
01:06:45,298 --> 01:06:48,000
um

1899
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,380
maybe it has grapefruit in it maybe

1900
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,818
doesn't depends who you ask that's

1901
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,318
official story it came from breeder

1902
01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:54,298
Steve's Camp but it's regardless of

1903
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:56,759
what's in it it's for sure a Northern

1904
01:06:54,298 --> 01:07:00,000
Lights KC

1905
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:02,460
um Haze dominant hybrid and it's been

1906
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,838
around I I personally consider like one

1907
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,639
of the most elite poems in Canada

1908
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,858
because if you look at like the cruise

1909
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:11,038
that it came from it came from you know

1910
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:12,960
breeders to use crew and and uh you look

1911
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,420
at the people that still hold that

1912
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,059
cutting around and they had access to

1913
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:20,159
Romulan and all these crazy genetics and

1914
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:21,660
sweet tooth and all that and the only

1915
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:22,798
you don't see any Sweet Tooth clones

1916
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:24,298
still going around you don't see any

1917
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:25,798
Romulan clones still going around for

1918
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:29,038
the most part you see a whole lot of

1919
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:29,639
people that held on to uh sweet skunk

1920
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,920
um

1921
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:34,019
so I kind of just to me I just kind of

1922
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:38,818
to me as a classic like Canadian

1923
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:40,559
heirloom and I like sativas but I don't

1924
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:42,420
I'm like kind of like some bottom end to

1925
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,039
go with them I don't really like the I

1926
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:47,639
kind of like some mercy and stuff and

1927
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:48,780
I'd like some uh flavor I like kind of

1928
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:51,420
some of the modern flavors so I just

1929
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:53,160
threw I just reversed um

1930
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:54,780
sweets got gone to just all the Clones

1931
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:56,219
that I had and happened to have a GMO in

1932
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:58,079
there and it wasn't actually my plan I

1933
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:59,279
just kind of threw out the progeny of a

1934
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,599
bunch of different stuff that I had in

1935
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,700
the GMO one is the one that really

1936
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:04,440
clicked some of the

1937
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:07,679
um I was just basically looking for uh

1938
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,539
to pull a really nice Haze dominant you

1939
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,239
know personal cut

1940
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:13,500
um out of it and honestly the I think

1941
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,838
which is kind of in line with what you

1942
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,939
hear with a lot of haze stuff it sweet

1943
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:20,460
skunk puts out a lot of junk and I think

1944
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:21,479
that's kind of the story of Hayes is I

1945
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:23,819
don't know that anyone's ever going to

1946
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:25,439
release like a really great Haze seed

1947
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:27,779
line they could pop like it pays

1948
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,159
dominance seed line if you pop like a 10

1949
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:31,199
pack and you're like this is it this is

1950
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:32,698
the keeper it's more like you pop like a

1951
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,259
hundred and find one that's really nice

1952
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:36,000
and a whole bunch that are pretty

1953
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:37,640
mediocre and that was kind of the story

1954
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,539
of uh

1955
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,640
definitely there's some nice stuff in

1956
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:44,460
there and there's also a bunch of uh

1957
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:46,739
really midsy stuff in there but I got

1958
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:49,259
the ones I I kept three out of what I

1959
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:50,818
think about 150 that I popped that are

1960
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:52,619
all uh

1961
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:56,779
um super nice but a lot of them went

1962
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:56,778
right in the in the hash pile for sure

1963
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:02,939
I love it uh no room for the week in the

1964
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:05,819
stable that's that's really cool and out

1965
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:08,039
of curiosity what sort of project would

1966
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:10,020
you want to work on next given you know

1967
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:11,880
you've done a lot of the sort of haze

1968
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,199
type stuff with this sweet skunk project

1969
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,460
do you want something different or are

1970
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,979
you like more keen to get down the

1971
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,079
rabbit hole

1972
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:20,459
uh I kind of I'm kind of I've been

1973
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:22,500
around like I said I've been around a

1974
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,420
long time I kind of

1975
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,560
between I've traveled a lot so I've kind

1976
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,179
of got to experience a lot of what's

1977
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,819
going around in the U.S a lot of what's

1978
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:31,020
going around in Canada and I've gone to

1979
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:33,120
the Netherlands quite a few times so

1980
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:36,480
I've tried everything and I kind of know

1981
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:38,460
what I like and so I've kind of Taken

1982
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,019
and said I'm not a commercial breeder I

1983
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,119
have no interest in doing I kind of just

1984
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:44,100
breed for my own head

1985
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:46,858
um and it kind of just comes into a few

1986
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,179
camps like I like purple kush stuff I

1987
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:51,900
like

1988
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:52,920
um stuff like the you know Haze stuff

1989
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:54,659
um

1990
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,659
you know like some of like the Bubba

1991
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:58,920
stuff and I've kind of got a pretty good

1992
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:00,238
stable

1993
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,579
um trying to think the only thing I

1994
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,738
actually plan on doing is that that Haze

1995
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:06,479
project isn't really done so both most

1996
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:09,299
of the stuff I probably don't have a lot

1997
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:11,698
of plans for that sweet spin project was

1998
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:13,380
kind of the first stage so one of the

1999
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:16,319
things I always really liked that stood

2000
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:18,300
out in history to me is Neville taste so

2001
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,460
I bought a quite a few packs back in

2002
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:23,100
like the I think it was around 2000 or

2003
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,658
so back when Neville and Shanty released

2004
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,100
their original level says I have no idea

2005
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:27,539
maybe it's the same now I personally

2006
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:29,219
doubt it but he was for sure the

2007
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:31,439
original Neville caves which was the

2008
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:33,899
haze a male

2009
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:38,039
um I can't remember the exact mix but it

2010
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:40,859
was a the two male hazes Haze ahc and

2011
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:43,140
Northern Lights and that was like jungle

2012
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:45,179
weed but they had some crazy Finos that

2013
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,340
I would consider in that class the best

2014
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:50,460
that I've ever smoked and I've never

2015
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:52,140
seen anything similar to it

2016
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,460
um so that was kind and the thing with

2017
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,659
Haze is if you want to find a really

2018
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,158
good one that you want it's pretty

2019
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:57,539
expensive to be buying all those packs

2020
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:59,158
of seeds because I really think you need

2021
01:10:57,539 --> 01:11:01,979
to buy like 100 to find something really

2022
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:04,979
good and uh so I kind of went at it from

2023
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:07,139
another point of like okay that's the

2024
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:08,579
haze C side was the sweets Gunk and I

2025
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,260
found something that I really liked kind

2026
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:12,420
of modernized a little bit with the GMO

2027
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,820
like just above the turp and the potency

2028
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:15,960
up and now I want to try what I really

2029
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:19,380
want out of is kind of one of those

2030
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,899
incensey Neville's Haze type of types

2031
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:24,900
um so I right now I just reversed uh

2032
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:27,719
that Band-Aid number seven on the really

2033
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:30,299
late flowering like 17 week flowering uh

2034
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:31,619
Haze phenos with that sweet skunk and

2035
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,659
it'll probably try to find some other

2036
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:35,279
stuff that's got that Haze a side in it

2037
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:36,899
to bring it in and then just sift

2038
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:38,399
through those but I don't really I guess

2039
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:40,559
they're technically breeding projects to

2040
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,139
me they're just sifting projects I'm not

2041
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,039
a I kind of look at cannabis to next a

2042
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,659
little bit different than a lot of

2043
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:46,979
people I kind of look at I used to be

2044
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:49,319
down the same line with everyone with

2045
01:11:46,979 --> 01:11:50,759
all the ibls and all that and I kind of

2046
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:53,039
look at it it's more like when they

2047
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,260
breed like trees or strawberries or

2048
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:57,420
these other like really outcrossing

2049
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,100
species where it's just like you kind of

2050
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,600
whack an elite clone an elite clone and

2051
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,219
grow it a whole crapload seeds and take

2052
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,199
the one that makes the combination we

2053
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:05,640
want so that's kind of more what I'm I

2054
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:07,678
don't really consider much of a breeding

2055
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,780
project as just like a genetic sifting

2056
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,158
product that's about the only thing I'd

2057
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:12,840
probably plan on

2058
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:14,339
on

2059
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,079
working like to make some more

2060
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,699
productive use of my space just growing

2061
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:18,658
some of the Clones that have sifted over

2062
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:22,500
the years

2063
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:24,839
yeah nice beautiful stuff well I'm

2064
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:28,140
incredibly jealous I think that some of

2065
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,719
those uh Neville's Hayes on to the uh

2066
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:32,640
the 16 17 week sweet skunk Finos would

2067
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,279
be some beautiful stuff for all of our

2068
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,600
sativa lovers out there I would be

2069
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,579
interested to hear you just you just

2070
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,900
referenced it yourself you know flaring

2071
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:42,960
out some of the Clones you've sort of

2072
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:45,479
acquired over the years what is the one

2073
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,239
clone that you used to have that you

2074
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:50,399
really wish you could get back

2075
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,799
um not many of them to be honest uh I

2076
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,059
guess it's the one that stands out I

2077
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,079
really liked

2078
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:58,320
um

2079
01:12:55,079 --> 01:13:01,019
there was uh when Legends used to have

2080
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,698
uh that Legends ultimate Indica which

2081
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,880
that was this Ortega clone that actually

2082
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:07,198
came from uh Ed Rosenthal crossed with

2083
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,779
the sweet tooth and I said I'm not a

2084
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:12,059
sweet tooth fan at all but uh that

2085
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:13,460
popped out these crazy like Jurassic

2086
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:16,140
looking

2087
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:18,480
indicofinos and I used to run like back

2088
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:20,159
in the early 2000s or whenever whenever

2089
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,079
that was reader Steve was really pumping

2090
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:23,759
all that stuff out from Switzerland I

2091
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,140
ran quite a few packs of that and most

2092
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,300
of them I didn't like their really sweet

2093
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:31,140
tooth dominant but they popped at these

2094
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:33,179
crazy or tagofinos and uh those I really

2095
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,500
like they don't stand up like today the

2096
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:35,819
flavor definitely wasn't the same but

2097
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,539
they just had

2098
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:41,340
super insane uh Mercy name they were

2099
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:43,019
just so heavy

2100
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,360
um I don't think I think it was a fairly

2101
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:47,280
flat profile compared to like an OG or

2102
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,139
cookies or something like that but they

2103
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,539
were just really heavy indicas and

2104
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:53,340
that's what I really prefer

2105
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:55,319
um that one I missed I used to have a

2106
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:58,260
really good Ortega clone

2107
01:13:55,319 --> 01:14:00,840
um or whatever the terrigofino Clone and

2108
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,219
probably the biggest one it was a couple

2109
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,840
of indicators like I used to have an old

2110
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:04,920
Northern Lights Number One clone that

2111
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,960
was really good

2112
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,100
and I also used to have a Northern

2113
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,600
Lights we think it was in Northern

2114
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,880
Lights Number two but that's the one

2115
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,800
that really stands out and that was

2116
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,000
we got it like whatever one of those

2117
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,400
stories it was like from my friend's

2118
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,198
Uncle who had it since like the 80s and

2119
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:20,639
I think it was if you it was one you

2120
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,198
could actually Trace back and I'm like

2121
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:26,280
okay like that literally came from like

2122
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:28,799
1988 1987 kind of period and it was like

2123
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:30,059
this super

2124
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,619
um it's actually I got the very first

2125
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:35,400
picture I ever posted on Instagram is

2126
01:14:31,619 --> 01:14:37,979
from that clone and uh it was like this

2127
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:39,479
super squat indica and it looked a lot

2128
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:42,899
like the a lot of the Northern Lights

2129
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:44,759
you'll see and the terp profile was just

2130
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:46,859
off the hook like and I've never tried

2131
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,699
anything similar to that there's lots of

2132
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:49,679
stuff today that I think is like

2133
01:14:47,698 --> 01:14:50,879
comparable but way different

2134
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,960
um I really like to get that one and

2135
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,880
that was one of those ones that to me

2136
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,619
always stood the test of time that

2137
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,600
you know people didn't keep clones a lot

2138
01:14:55,619 --> 01:14:59,039
back then for a long because it was just

2139
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,179
whatever someone would grow for a year

2140
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:02,158
and there would be like police pressure

2141
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,899
on them so they shut down and not keep

2142
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:05,639
their clones and it was hard to get

2143
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,799
stuff back in that one I remember like

2144
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:09,659
losing a bunch of times and every time I

2145
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,940
went to look for it you know over like a

2146
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:13,619
10-year period I could always find a

2147
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:16,439
friend of a friend of a friend who still

2148
01:15:13,619 --> 01:15:18,238
had that old NL clone that came out it

2149
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:20,119
came out of Squamish in DC which is a

2150
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:23,158
little small place north of Vancouver

2151
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:25,559
and uh yeah I mean I think that thing

2152
01:15:23,158 --> 01:15:27,238
was like I don't remember like we had it

2153
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,300
up I think I lost it maybe 10 years ago

2154
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:32,819
and it was from like 1986 or 87 or 88

2155
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,480
something in that definitely late 80s

2156
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,399
um

2157
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:36,899
and I've never seen anything similar to

2158
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:38,759
that so definitely like that I'd

2159
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:41,158
probably like and then some of the

2160
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,020
incense the Novelties used to have

2161
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:44,039
that's about it most of the stuff like I

2162
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:45,659
kind of

2163
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,219
that's kind of what I find interesting

2164
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:49,500
with genetics is the stuff just kind of

2165
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:51,600
repeats like that old famous Northern

2166
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,819
lure that Northern Lights Number One

2167
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,620
clone that that I really like from back

2168
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:57,719
there it's pretty darn similar to Bubba

2169
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:59,698
and Bubba's got basically everything it

2170
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,980
had plus like some better flavor to it

2171
01:15:59,698 --> 01:16:03,658
so I don't think we lose a ton of the

2172
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:05,698
stuff I kind of think a lot of it just

2173
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:08,158
gets a little bit improved and the name

2174
01:16:05,698 --> 01:16:11,039
gets changed over time

2175
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:13,259
yeah certainly as I get more experience

2176
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,000
with the NLS I see a lot of bubber in it

2177
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:17,940
for sure so that's that's cool to hear

2178
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,340
that um you see that as well

2179
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:22,500
at this point I think it'd be good to to

2180
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:24,719
run through some of our quick fire

2181
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,238
questions I've got a little alternative

2182
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,800
list of questions for you in case you

2183
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:31,559
had prepared some answers I wanted to

2184
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,079
keep you on your toes so I wanted to ask

2185
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:37,080
you in your opinion what do you think is

2186
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,100
the most underrated Canadian clone or

2187
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:41,219
genetic

2188
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:42,780
to honestly it's the king it's not a lot

2189
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:44,640
the Canadian gene pool is actually

2190
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:47,099
pretty shallow when you digging into it

2191
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,420
it's mostly American genetics

2192
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,420
um underrated one

2193
01:16:50,579 --> 01:16:53,059
two

2194
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,679
I don't know if I could go with an under

2195
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,000
under uh sorry I think that like this is

2196
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:01,980
my personal opinion I really like the

2197
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,439
death Bubba which is like a modern one

2198
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:06,359
that's pretty commercialized I

2199
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:07,799
personally think that's like that's one

2200
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:09,719
of the Clones that I would if I had to

2201
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,219
pick a couple I'd pick death bubble I

2202
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,880
think that's the

2203
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:13,800
um

2204
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,500
I think sometimes just because it's

2205
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,659
super popular doesn't mean it's not also

2206
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,880
super good I think that's a good one

2207
01:17:18,658 --> 01:17:22,079
nice that's good I I would be interested

2208
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,119
in hearing how does that differ from

2209
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,279
Bubba because I haven't heard and seen a

2210
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:27,899
lot of it but never really read too much

2211
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:30,119
specifics about it

2212
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:32,819
it's a it's a baba I said I've never

2213
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:35,539
i've smoked a lot of like Bubba from

2214
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:37,619
seed I haven't smoked any of the like

2215
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:40,079
pre-98 or like the ones you're like okay

2216
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:41,819
this is the legit cut I haven't smoked

2217
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,039
that I'm like for sure that's to compare

2218
01:17:41,819 --> 01:17:47,099
it with what I can tell is just a it's a

2219
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:49,140
really nice Bubba but it's got some fuel

2220
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,760
to it like a little bit more if you I

2221
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:52,560
think it was like uh

2222
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,199
think if I had to guess it probably

2223
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,820
originally came from uh pip Swede from

2224
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,639
souvenir seeds or something like that

2225
01:17:56,819 --> 01:18:02,099
and the story was it was because he's

2226
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:04,199
the only guy ever seen it it was as a

2227
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,360
death star or one of those death things

2228
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:08,579
that came out of Ohio

2229
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:11,339
um and it was like that I think it's the

2230
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:13,140
choco Sour Diesel cut crossed with that

2231
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:14,520
Scentsy star there's a Scentsy star that

2232
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,659
was around that Ohio area that's really

2233
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,300
good

2234
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:20,639
um crossed into one of the Bubbas and

2235
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,719
maybe it wasn't from from the hips but I

2236
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,219
know he's made a lot of that stuff

2237
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:26,399
around that time period and it actually

2238
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:28,439
came into it was one of the dispensaries

2239
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:30,960
in kind of that gray Market scene before

2240
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:32,639
it got legal and it was like for a while

2241
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,539
it was like the top clone going around

2242
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,659
to

2243
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:37,859
BC and it was locked down hard and I'm

2244
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:39,059
not even sure what I have the most

2245
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:41,339
common one that's going around whether

2246
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:42,840
it's the actual original I don't know

2247
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,100
um but I I really like it from my

2248
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,260
personal

2249
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,420
um thing I like those narcotic narcotic

2250
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:52,140
indicas but I just consider a bubble

2251
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:54,480
with some uh with a bit more fuel to it

2252
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:56,219
yeah nice okay well hey I'm gonna have

2253
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:58,019
to keep an eye out that sounds like it's

2254
01:18:56,219 --> 01:19:00,600
uh pretty nice actually if it's got a

2255
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:02,520
bit of sour d and Scentsy star in there

2256
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,079
but like I said that's it's actually in

2257
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,880
America it's actually American genetics

2258
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:09,800
it just goes around in Canada like most

2259
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:13,260
of the stuff yeah okay out of curiosity

2260
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:17,279
I like I know people say that you know

2261
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:19,260
pink cushes had its day in the sun I I

2262
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:21,479
haven't had it that much but I I think

2263
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,800
it's the best where do you rate it do

2264
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:24,539
you think it's like we're done with it

2265
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,159
or what's your thoughts

2266
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:27,960
no so I'm kind of the opposite to most

2267
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,539
people how I do is I don't pay attention

2268
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:32,819
to the hype at all usually and I kind of

2269
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:34,439
go like I think I think I told them

2270
01:19:32,819 --> 01:19:35,819
before like ogs were going around for

2271
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:37,439
like at least a decade before I even

2272
01:19:35,819 --> 01:19:39,960
bothered trying them because I'm just so

2273
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,579
just been around so long it's it's

2274
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,198
usually the hype isn't that isn't

2275
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:45,059
actually worth the hype and I've just

2276
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:46,919
wasted a ton of time chasing that crap

2277
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,179
when I was younger so now I kind of just

2278
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,679
don't even pay attention and when

2279
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:53,100
something like deathclub is a great

2280
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:54,539
example where that BC usually the really

2281
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,159
good stuff floats to the top and it

2282
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:57,420
stays around for a long time and when I

2283
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,579
see stuff staying around I'm like oh

2284
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:01,679
maybe I'll try that and

2285
01:19:59,579 --> 01:20:03,539
pink Kush definitely was passed that

2286
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:06,658
test I personally think it's super nice

2287
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:08,698
I like it I don't consider it as good to

2288
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:12,359
me I consider it very similar to like an

2289
01:20:08,698 --> 01:20:14,698
OG and I consider OG better

2290
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:16,559
um so I think it's like the same type I

2291
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:17,759
personally think that OG is a higher

2292
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,920
quality I think being coach probably

2293
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,179
yields better and it's a nicer Growers

2294
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,380
part I think it's super nice like I

2295
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:24,239
don't think it's probably going anywhere

2296
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:27,539
but I personally like to choose between

2297
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:31,439
an OG and a pink pressure choose OG nice

2298
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:33,779
nice maybe a reflection of uh how little

2299
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:36,059
I've tried pincush is why I still like

2300
01:20:33,779 --> 01:20:38,279
it who knows

2301
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:41,100
um one of our normal quickfire questions

2302
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:43,019
we ask people what is your most favorite

2303
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,520
cannabis experience you've ever had so

2304
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:46,380
be it like you know just trying a

2305
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,360
certain strain a certain hit of hash

2306
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:50,619
like what really stands out to you as

2307
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:53,670
one of the most memorable

2308
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:53,670
[Music]

2309
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,880
most memorable and again some of these

2310
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,140
ones it's like I don't know was it

2311
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,420
really that great or was it just because

2312
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:02,100
you were an experienced smoker but like

2313
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,480
I grew up it was all hash right it was

2314
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,400
you got it was all I grew up when it was

2315
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:06,979
just Imports around you got you couldn't

2316
01:21:05,399 --> 01:21:09,179
even smoke you couldn't even sell

2317
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:11,099
homegrown like if you wanted to sell

2318
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:12,779
whatever skunk number one you had to

2319
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,820
like press it into a brick and make it

2320
01:21:12,779 --> 01:21:16,198
go all prouder and sell it as Mexican or

2321
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:18,420
something so I kind of grew up around

2322
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:20,698
the import and the part of Canada was

2323
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,319
from it was all hash and most of it was

2324
01:21:20,698 --> 01:21:24,178
Afghan hash

2325
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:26,399
um or you know that border actually it's

2326
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:28,380
produced on like the you know Afghan

2327
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,759
Pakistan area and every once in a while

2328
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,380
we get something different and this

2329
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,480
actually when I look back it seemed like

2330
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:35,880
really low quality hash and it was like

2331
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:37,559
a blonde Lebanese and I think in

2332
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,819
hindsight that was probably not that I

2333
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,620
would consider Lebanese like a super

2334
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:41,880
it's a sativa but it's not like a

2335
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:43,319
whatever it's not like a haze or

2336
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,039
something like that

2337
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:46,679
um

2338
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:49,019
but I totally remember being at like a

2339
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:51,840
whatever like a bush party which is

2340
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:53,640
um on the side of this cliff and smoking

2341
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,679
this Lebanese hash for the first time

2342
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,179
and that's one of the few experiences

2343
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,739
that I would say so this is way back

2344
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:02,640
when I was like 18 or something like

2345
01:21:58,738 --> 01:22:04,439
that and back in the 80s and that's one

2346
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,119
of the few cannabis experience that I

2347
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:08,399
would like compare to like taking acid

2348
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:09,420
or mushrooms like it was very

2349
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:12,000
um

2350
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:13,619
psychedelic and again maybe it was just

2351
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,560
the fried grown-up smoke in these like

2352
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:18,359
super heavy Afghan hashes and maybe that

2353
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,159
was just one of my first real sativa

2354
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:23,039
experiences but that one really stands

2355
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:25,500
up and my mind it had a crazy flavor and

2356
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:27,300
this really intense cerebral eye whereas

2357
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,979
I just remember sitting off by myself on

2358
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:32,460
the side of this Cliff going into like

2359
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:33,779
deep deep introspective thoughts that so

2360
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,340
that probably is the one to stand there

2361
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:37,738
the most still it was a long time ago

2362
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:39,480
sounds like a beautiful experience I'm

2363
01:22:37,738 --> 01:22:43,379
very jealous I'm not sure I've ever had

2364
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:45,238
proper Lebanese uh hash maybe years ago

2365
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:46,800
in Amsterdam but like who even knows

2366
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:49,678
what that was really

2367
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,760
most of it sucks most of it is not very

2368
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,060
good

2369
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:56,280
there you go okay so uh we're gonna drop

2370
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,300
you off on an island what three genetics

2371
01:22:56,279 --> 01:22:59,460
you're gonna take is it going to be

2372
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,260
clones or seeds you want to do some seed

2373
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:02,520
sifting yourself what are we going to

2374
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:04,920
leave you with

2375
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,300
no I'd probably take clones I've popped

2376
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,340
a lot of seeds in my time I think I'm

2377
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,679
getting older in my retirements When I

2378
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:12,480
Grow clones really well I would

2379
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:14,579
definitely I said I'm not a big sativa

2380
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:16,319
guy but I really the one I actually I

2381
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:18,238
like kind of those heavy

2382
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:19,619
heavy Neville's Haze types but other

2383
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:21,178
than for like what I would consider like

2384
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:23,698
a classic sativa the only one I really

2385
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:26,039
smoke regularly is that uh Roberts Creek

2386
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:27,960
Congo I would definitely take that even

2387
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:29,640
though I don't really smoke it a ton I

2388
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,020
really like having it around for uh if

2389
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,039
you ever want to smoke in the daytime or

2390
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:34,260
anything

2391
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:37,380
uh

2392
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:39,780
probably the death Bubba

2393
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:43,260
and something purple I don't know it's

2394
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:45,840
like a purple kush or uh I like those

2395
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,280
almost like a almost like cookies type

2396
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,560
but when it's like I don't even know

2397
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:52,079
what the terp profile is that kind of

2398
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:54,780
funky purple cushy lavender like a

2399
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:56,039
lavender Turf I find I've tried a lot of

2400
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:58,559
stuff that's pretty similar I like that

2401
01:23:56,039 --> 01:23:59,939
lavender eater stuff but uh those are

2402
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,100
probably the three some one of those

2403
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:04,738
purpley lavender types

2404
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:06,420
the Congo and uh some death Bubba for

2405
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:09,178
night time

2406
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:11,219
beautiful stuff beautiful stuff so for a

2407
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:13,260
final question I'd love to ask you if

2408
01:24:11,219 --> 01:24:16,560
you go back in time anywhere any place

2409
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:18,480
to get one genetic or cut or whatever it

2410
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,159
may be where are you going when and what

2411
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:20,879
are you grabbing

2412
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:22,198
um

2413
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,480
so I'm not a mushroom I know everyone

2414
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:25,979
talks about like their Landry they're

2415
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,899
gonna go back to Afghanistan and stuff

2416
01:24:25,979 --> 01:24:29,039
and I do actually travel a lot but I

2417
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:30,359
don't really have a lot of interest in

2418
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,760
traveling to other countries I really

2419
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:34,679
like travel around North America

2420
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,300
um I would probably and I also like

2421
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:39,000
people doing other like a lot of the

2422
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:41,100
sifting before me I would probably go on

2423
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
dead tour somewhere

2424
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:44,520
um

2425
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,800
both to catch some good Dead shows and

2426
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,000
to catch some of some that was all dead

2427
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,679
tour back in the day like that was

2428
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,020
really to me I look at it as like a

2429
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,819
funnel point where all the best genetics

2430
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,900
are all the best weed going around in

2431
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:57,479
the U.S

2432
01:24:54,899 --> 01:24:59,039
ended up on dead tour so I would

2433
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:01,979
probably take like

2434
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:03,719
dead tour maybe back in like the 80s

2435
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:05,819
sometime maybe before just before the

2436
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:07,380
seed bank or something so like

2437
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:09,599
definitely something in the 80s and then

2438
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:11,359
I think you could catch the combo of

2439
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,679
like what was going around there before

2440
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,119
you know Neville just blew up the scene

2441
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,920
but you know I think that's really one

2442
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:19,619
of the nuclear events that happened in

2443
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,239
cannabis is Neville like just not

2444
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:22,920
necessarily that he was like the be-all

2445
01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:25,259
and I know he just spread so much of

2446
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:27,560
very similar genetics everywhere I kind

2447
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:30,300
of like to maybe go in there whatever

2448
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,560
mid 80s or early 80s before that was

2449
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,360
around but I think there was a lot of

2450
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,120
domestic cultivation

2451
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:38,460
on dead tour and uh catch some bread

2452
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:40,140
Brent uh Midland shows while I was there

2453
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,760
because he was an awesome guitar or

2454
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:44,219
awesome keyboardist

2455
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,719
hell yeah sounds like a good one to pick

2456
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:47,100
I like that a lot

2457
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:48,960
so

2458
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,460
