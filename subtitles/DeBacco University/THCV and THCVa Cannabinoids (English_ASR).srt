00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,000
going to go over thcv

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,599
and thcva cannabinoid and give you kind

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,240
of some insights into the potential

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,919
future

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,759
because we're not exactly sure where

7
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:17,920
this one might be going so hopefully you

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,920
find this video lecture interesting

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,640
[Music]

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,679
all right let's get into thcv and thcva

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
cannabinoids

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,239
now if you're really interested in

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
cannabinoids and want to learn more this

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,959
is a great research article you're

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,479
welcome to check out with some more

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
details

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,558
for this cannabinoid as well as others

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,079
you might find on this channel but this

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,159
is a great kind of information

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,119
with the citation here in reference so

21
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,639
you can go through and

22
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,159
learn all about the cannabinoids that

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,719
you want so first off looking at thcv

24
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,199
the active form of thcva has been shown

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
to have

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,440
psychoactive effect and an impact on

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
modulating the cb1

28
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,000
receptors but it has shown to be a

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,120
fraction of the strength of thc

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,079
so while it does have some similarities

31
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,198
to thc

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,719
it's clearly not as strong so it does

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,039
have some of those psychoactive effects

34
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,920
which

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,600
is looking in the future will this be

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,118
regulated is something to consider

37
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,879
if this is shown to have psychoactive

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,438
effects even though it may not be as

39
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,640
strong

40
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,719
as those found in the thc molecule

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
so thtv and diabetes so there are some

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,640
benefits it has been shown

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
to kind of ameliorate insulin

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,079
sensitivity in

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,319
at least mouse models indicating that it

46
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,158
may prove to be an effective treatment

47
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,639
for diabetes or at least a contributing

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,600
factor to reducing the negative effects

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
of diabetes

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,519
additionally it's been found to be both

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,599
a stimulant and an appetite

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,879
suppressant so again just other things

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,359
to kind of look at we can see some

54
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,920
things

55
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,118
listed right here and this does warrant

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,118
further research

57
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,319
however looking at the future uh

58
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,719
particularly with uh

59
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,559
thcv uh and other variant type

60
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,280
cannabinoids are being eagerly studied

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
currently

62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
oregon cbd has currently released a

63
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,919
variety of polyploid hemp

64
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,799
that will express the varying type

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,759
cannabinoids but they are focused on

66
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,520
cbdv production it is difficult to

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,038
predict whether or not

68
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,878
thcv will be tightly regulated or not

69
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,359
as it does have some psychoactive

70
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,560
potential not as strong as thc but some

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
psychoactive potential

72
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,680
may cause it to be regulated going

73
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
forward

74
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,719
and that's why it should be cautiously

75
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,000
studied and look at the true medical

76
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,639
benefits

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,919
but again having the psychoactive makes

78
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,639
some researchers and some breeders a

79
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,719
little wary

80
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,839
that it might be regulated in the future

81
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,280
so this is

82
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,439
might limit some of the initial breeding

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
that occurs but it should not limit

84
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,039
any potential chance for beneficial

85
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,039
clinical trials
