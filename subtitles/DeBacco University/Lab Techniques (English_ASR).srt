1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
okay this will be a brief overview of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,700
some lab techniques you can see your

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,189
plate streaking to get isolated colonies

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,109
or bacteria and the whole point of

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,509
having good lab techniques is being able

6
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:15,449
to develop a repeat of that process

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,859
again and again so this proper

8
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,269
techniques are important what why are

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,680
they important while developing good

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,649
habits will help reduce the variability

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,660
and results we call that data noise and

12
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,028
we see here where the general trend is

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,118
somewhere right around here but the goal

14
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,410
of being well versed in techniques is

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,149
that you're eliminating some of the

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,340
peaks and the valleys you're reducing

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,070
the data noise now the only true way to

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,440
really improve your technique is through

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,558
practice so keep working with the

20
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,659
equipment keep keep at it and you will

21
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,390
hopefully get better and improve your

22
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,619
technique some common techniques is to

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,149
mention a couple there will be separate

24
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,128
videos on these but weighing objects

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,539
which might sound easy by pairing

26
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,640
procedures a good one to focus on

27
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,920
filtering the sterile technique and use

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,989
of a centrifuge we do see here in this

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,570
general lab here the amount of pipettes

30
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,969
that are around this centrifuge and

31
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,569
these techniques are utilized about with

32
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,188
different protocols be familiar with the

33
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,259
equipment that you have so know what

34
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,359
type of we had access to in this case

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,978
both of these people are pipetting when

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,420
using an automatic one and when you see

37
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,969
more of a manual one you want to

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,469
understand the options that each has so

39
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,489
these require smaller tips these require

40
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:28,319
these large glass tubes there so again

41
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:31,109
just generally performing the same basic

42
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,149
action but know what options that you

43
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,978
may have and what may be best fit for

44
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,770
the protocol that you're trying to meet

45
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,379
you do also lastly just as you're going

46
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:42,629
through and practicing wearing gloves is

47
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,269
typically something that's done in the

48
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,548
lab no matter what you're moving so your

49
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,379
dexterity can be affected by that so

50
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,290
when you're practicing again use gloves

51
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:55,530
and develop that feel and eventually

52
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,640
you'll be able to work just as well with

53
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,009
gloves if you're not used to wearing

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,659
them as you would be and have the same

55
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,659
feel as if you weren't wearing
