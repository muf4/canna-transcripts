1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
this in the a brief overview of the

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,450
Integra Atari system and even though you

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,339
may not know initially what that means

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,630
by looking at the picture here and

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,798
probably guess we're going to be dealing

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,599
something to do with our own skin so

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,329
starting with the basics Integra might

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,460
actually mean skin and skin and it's

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:21,989
appended make up the Integra teri system

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,760
that's why it's a system so we're at is

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,799
talking about skin so with the

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,019
appendages such as nails and hair and

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,710
they'll be future videos on that skin is

14
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:34,558
a contain Asst membrane that and is our

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,090
largest organ our skin alone accounts

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,039
for about seven percent of our body

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,690
weight so kind of important to keep this

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,079
in mind that this is covering our entire

19
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,718
body

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,429
it makes up 7% of our body weight so for

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,460
every hundred pounds you have about

22
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,450
seven pounds of just skin weight when we

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,370
talk about the dermis and the epidermis

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,920
and this cutaneous membrane is a

25
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,390
combination of both of those in this

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,260
system I'm talking about remember we're

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,210
also involving nails and also hair so

28
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,619
regions of the skin so just to go over a

29
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,439
couple two distinct regions we have the

30
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:07,289
epidermis epi meaning top and then the

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,938
dermis being the low lower level but the

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,520
lowest level here is the subcutaneous

33
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,219
level or the hypodermis this is a fatty

34
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,679
layer and it lies deep within the layers

35
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,929
of the skin so it's important to keep in

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,150
mind at first two distinctive regions

37
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,159
are the epidermis and that's the layer

38
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,719
that you can physically see and any of

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,609
the dermis below that and then the

40
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,978
subcutaneous or the hypodermis and

41
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,060
they're kind of used entertain ibly

42
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:32,900
lying beneath that and it tends to be

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,829
fatty meaning it contains adipose tissue

44
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,020
so some of the functions of the skin

45
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,759
there's a couple of major ones

46
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:40,769
protection cushions insulates and acts

47
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,049
as well waterproofing protects the skin

48
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:46,078
from chemicals heat cold bacteria in

49
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,210
screens UV light ultraviolet light can

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,069
think of it like a spacesuit as offering

51
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,469
protection from us from the harsh

52
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,798
outside environment synthesizes vitamin

53
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,359
D with UV light so it puts together

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,210
vitamin Davies just sunlight to help us

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,090
sum all that necessary vitamin regulates

56
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,459
body heat it helps with the adipose

57
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,219
tissue prevents unnecessary water loss

58
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,008
and contains sensory receptor or nerve

59
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,800
endings involved in the integumentary

60
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:17,519
system there's a couple major

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,080
functions here of the skin moving out as

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,700
a nice picture of the internment system

63
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,980
its components you're going to see this

64
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,139
image quite a bit while initially right

65
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,119
now some of these terms may sound a

66
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,459
little bit unfamiliar hopefully by the

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
end of this lecture series a lot of

68
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,969
these will make sense and you'll be able

69
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,829
to identify where they're located and

70
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,740
also their important function for the

71
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,200
body so the epidermis provides is the

72
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,450
most top layer with stratified squamous

73
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,530
epithelium that's just the type of cells

74
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,329
is what it looks like

75
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,620
there's several distinct layers and

76
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,200
there's two different types of skin

77
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,240
there's what we call thick skin which is

78
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,979
five layers and found on the palms of

79
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,500
your hand and soles of your feet and

80
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,060
then thin skin which is four layers and

81
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,479
basically covers the rest of your body

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,789
thin skin also is where hair follicles

83
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,679
are located thick skin is five layers

84
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,539
and does not contain any hair follicles

85
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,790
to give you just a quick comparison of

86
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,590
thin versus thick skin we could see the

87
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,530
epidermis here thickness on that thin

88
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,599
skin and where the skin is thicker it's

89
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:21,120
yet epidermal layer being much larger

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,560
much thicker in that region so skin

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,689
contains four basic types of tissue is

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
epithelium connective tissue which is

93
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:28,949
part of the dermis muscle tissue and

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,259
nervous tissue so right now I'm just

95
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,829
gonna kind of go over those basic tissue

96
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,259
types

97
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,200
there'll be other videos that go through

98
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,280
and discuss the muscle system

99
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,988
let's go system and the nervous system

100
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,140
but right now I just know it's made of

101
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,280
these four basic types of tissue the

102
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,779
dermal layer so we're getting a little

103
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,640
deeper into the skin now this is the

104
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,400
second major layer strong flexible

105
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,899
tissue often referred to as the hide so

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
you can see the animal hide here it's

107
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,860
isn't made up of mostly the dermal layer

108
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,439
rich supply of nerves and the vesicles

109
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,959
here critical role in temperature

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,759
regulation and it has two layers its

111
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,120
papillae layer which involves the dermal

112
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,789
papilla and the rectal layer which is

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,430
deeper layer and composes about 80% of

114
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:16,379
the thickness of the actual dermis off

115
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,199
lecture lines are creases in the palms

116
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,048
so I don't write can read palms like

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,519
maybe tell me my future there but this

118
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,049
is looking at the dermal layer this is

119
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,180
what's giving the actual ridges to the

120
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,040
palm in

121
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,889
new noggin a little deeper here to the

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,180
subcutaneous layer or hypodermis these

123
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,728
terms are kind of used interchangeable

124
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,310
you can see here hypodermis is actually

125
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:39,779
greek for below skin and subcutaneous is

126
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,970
actually latin for below skin

127
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,159
so those translate to the same just

128
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,020
again note one wanted really preferred

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,180
over the other be able to recognize both

130
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:51,089
there's a composed of loose connective

131
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,579
tissue adipose is an example stabilizes

132
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:56,099
the skin position loosely attached to

133
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,649
the dermal and muscle tissue so again

134
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,139
we're down here on the lower region this

135
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:03,959
is kind of tying this in this upper

136
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,660
epidermis and dermal layers and also

137
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,750
containing our veins and arteries and

138
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,910
some of our nerve endings in this

139
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,978
beautys layer hypodermis contains fat

140
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,930
cells different patterns of accumulation

141
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:18,329
based on male or female for those fat

142
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,129
deposits provides thermal insulation of

143
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:22,050
adipose tissues really great about and

144
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,089
cushions underlying organs another

145
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,280
important function remember the

146
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,168
hypodermis reserves hypodermic needles

147
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,508
and getting the other injection it's

148
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:33,478
being injected down into this hypodermic

149
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:35,370
layer again we've seen this picture

150
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,159
before hopefully now we're starting to

151
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,959
put together a couple pieces in other

152
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,449
videos you'll notice where some of these

153
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,459
other terms are also mentioned so this

154
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,288
entire image does not make sense to you

155
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,168
now hopefully we're starting to put

156
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:50,250
pieces and bits together as far as kind

157
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,348
of key items you should know at least

158
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,288
from this lecture looking at what's be

159
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:57,418
able to identify the epidermis dermis

160
00:05:54,288 --> 00:06:01,699
hypodermis and some of the other regions

161
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,698
will become in the future there
