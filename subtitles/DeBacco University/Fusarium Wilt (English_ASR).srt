1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
okay I'm going to go over a few Syrian

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,580
wealth and what we see on the title

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,599
slide here is an image of what true

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,059
serum looks like under the microscope

5
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,149
and this would be a pretty high degree

6
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:14,849
of infection and hopefully many of the

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,579
plants you grow no pathologist will see

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,350
this in any samples you bring them now

9
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,239
the identification of who Syria it's a

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,859
soil based on that second texture roots

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,089
it can happen to various degrees of

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,490
severity so it's not just on

13
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:30,059
one-size-fits-all looking here at very

14
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:32,098
severe cases they're very mild cases so

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,789
again this can have this variance makes

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,140
it a little hard to identify times where

17
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,149
to look where the plant will will as a

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,770
result of the root rot leaves will

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,129
quickly turn from a yellow to a brown

20
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,809
and also have a curl to them when this

21
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,549
is known as it advised to cut into the

22
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:50,308
stem inspector vascular tissue for

23
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,140
browning upon inspection of the roots

24
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,899
there may be a red orange coloration

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,698
notice once the media is removed so we

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,500
can see two plants here's is showing

27
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,030
that vascular system you can see the

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,679
upper portions don't look quite as bad

29
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,409
but especially down towards that soil

30
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,840
line we see that more tannish yellowish

31
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,510
temperature i tannish orange coloration

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,969
that's occurring it can progress to kind

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,340
of this green coloration and look almost

34
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:17,239
normal to top but again that vascular

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,650
system is infected here with Dew Syria

36
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,298
how to prevent it will avoid reusing

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,969
media's this can increase the odds of

38
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,340
accumulating Fusarium in infecting

39
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,900
subsequent plantings this is especially

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,909
true for outdoor operations that do not

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,670
rotate plants in the soil that's grown

42
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,280
in as part of a quality crop rotation

43
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,118
using Kerry vetches we see image in this

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,530
image here to aid an organic matter in

45
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:44,009
nitrogen fixation it's a great cover

46
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,500
crop as this can also nettle an often

47
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,409
those benefits but also potentially

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,269
reduce Fusarium well been shown in areas

49
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,670
of outdoor operations that grow

50
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,078
watermelon this hairy vetch great

51
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,780
organic matter of supplement great

52
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:02,639
nitrogen but in also Fusarium reduction

53
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,739
in outdoor soil for control so once

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,269
notice the area should be planned to be

55
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,579
rotated to reduce the chance of building

56
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,560
up a serum in the soil just because you

57
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,940
see a kind of mild infection one year

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,770
don't think that's going to go away the

59
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,840
next way it's only going to get worse

60
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,030
so this is be a clean plan so you're

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
starting to see infections early on you

62
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,780
don't want to plant repeatedly

63
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,329
applications in there to get to more

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,669
severe cases down here if you do see

65
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,170
this reducing nitrogen in season you do

66
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,149
not over water and can help slow the

67
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,919
progression as fund the states only

68
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,590
offer a reduction in spreading and are

69
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,439
not a cure to measure so it's important

70
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,210
as a grower to recognize this early do

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,579
what you can to get by with the closing

72
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,550
out of that season and to know you need

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,040
to rotate out for the volunteer two or

74
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,439
even three or greater if that is

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,419
possible to help reduce the chance of

76
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,109
getting to cerium well in future

77
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,109
plantings
