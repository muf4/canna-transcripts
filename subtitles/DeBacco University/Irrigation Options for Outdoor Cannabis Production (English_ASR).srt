here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,878
we'll be covering uh three of the main

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,759
irrigation options for outdoor

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:09,519
production

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:16,079
giving you some of the advantages and

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:19,198
disadvantages of each

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,719
[Music]

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,359
all right let's go over irrigation

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,118
options for outdoor cannabis production

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,400
well first off with outdoor production

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,079
just in general

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,678
with the lack of reliable predictions

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,079
and rain events serious growers will

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:31,839
install

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,079
some form of irrigation system

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,640
especially for high value crops

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,239
such as cannabis in addition an

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,239
irrigation system allows

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,799
for nutrient solution to be added during

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,359
the season to not only hydrate but avoid

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,759
potential

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,759
nutrient deficiencies in the plants so

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,519
this is why it is worth the

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,519
initial investment even if you're having

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
a rainy start to the season

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
outdoor irrigation is strongly

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,960
encouraged and advised particularly for

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,079
high value crops

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
now what are the three types we're going

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,640
to talk about well the first one is

31
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,558
going to be drip irrigation

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
the advantages of drip irrigation is

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,599
that it has minimal water loss it's a

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
very efficient

35
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,919
method of irrigation it also allows

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,118
growers to have precise control over the

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,200
plant irrigation

38
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,959
we can clearly see here especially if

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,400
growing in long rows

40
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,879
however the disadvantages are the

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,118
upfront cost of buying all the materials

42
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,560
neither drip tape but the main lines and

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,719
fittings that are required as well as

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,478
filters potential timers

45
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,478
also the initial setup it is a little

46
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,959
bit of labor intensive to set up

47
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,159
or if you're looking at doing uh plastic

48
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,519
mulches

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,880
that initial setup can be done by

50
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,438
attractors you're laying the plastic

51
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,039
mulch

52
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,919
but there is still the need to buy the

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,360
equipment you need to set it up properly

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
so that can be a

55
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,719
drawback of this type of system there's

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,118
also

57
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,959
overhead irrigation the advantages here

58
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,719
is that it's very easy to set up

59
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,559
a couple of misters here make sure they

60
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,519
overlap depending on the pressure and

61
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,519
volume you have

62
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,959
depends how many you can run but you're

63
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,000
looking at you only need to stall them

64
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,239
down rows

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,680
within the field there's also minimum

66
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,280
equipment requirements typically they

67
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
operate at high pressure

68
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
they're pretty forgiving if there's

69
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,719
small particulate in the lines

70
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
so that is there are two of the great

71
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,759
advantages of overhead

72
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,280
however the disadvantage to overhead

73
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,239
irrigation is there's high rates of

74
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,719
water lost

75
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,039
to evaporation and also this method

76
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,878
inherently increases leaf wetness

77
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,560
which late in the season could increase

78
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:23,759
odds of bud rot for especially talking

79
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,520
about cannabis

80
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,878
so keep that in mind that early in the

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
season it might be great or on really

82
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,799
hot days to kind of cool the plants

83
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
but later in the season it could present

84
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,560
or increase the odds of potential issues

85
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,479
such as bud rot

86
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
and then lastly there's hand watering

87
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,919
the advantages is that allows for

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
plant-specific care however the

89
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,719
disadvantage is it can be very

90
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,039
time-consuming

91
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,800
also plants can be missed by growers

92
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,799
just not intentionally

93
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
but just missing a plant we talk about

94
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
time consuming especially in large-scale

95
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,799
productions it can be very time

96
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,719
consuming

97
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
two hours a day could be spent just

98
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,080
irrigating the plants

99
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,759
but it does allow for that specific

100
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
plant care and in smaller

101
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,518
plant growing operations uh the

102
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,079
advantages of that specific care and

103
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,480
lack of

104
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
really any specialized equipment could

105
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,679
allow it to be utilized in that type of

106
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,039
operation

107
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,599
each of these three are discussed

108
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,598
