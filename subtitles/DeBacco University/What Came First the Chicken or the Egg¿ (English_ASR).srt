1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,448
so in this video we're gonna look at

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,640
what came first the chicken or the egg

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:06,449
and actually you can get to an answer at

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,089
the end here

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,980
her this debated of many times amongst

6
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,480
people looking first at chicken or the

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,980
egg with the egg the chicken the chicken

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,710
or the egg we're gonna get to an answer

9
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,050
or support that was science so again

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,080
chicken or the egg which one came first

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,219
let's get to some of the reasons here so

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,799
looking at first great moments in

13
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:28,140
evolution birds share a common ancestor

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,089
with sharks and fish so the distant

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,920
relatives of birds had to make the jump

16
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,558
in the aquatic environment to the

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,939
terrestrial one we see Gary Larson here

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,009
far side comics great moments in

19
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,299
evolution we see the fish and there's

20
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,820
the baseball how we're gonna make this

21
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:45,479
jump in this aquatic environment to this

22
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,308
terrestrial well it's not that easy the

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,109
terrestrial environment has a lot of

24
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:50,849
challenges one of them is increased

25
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,558
amount of gravity you know in the

26
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,329
aquatic environment whales can get big

27
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,488
and support themselves easily with the

28
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,128
buoyancy of water well not so much in

29
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,929
the terrestrial environment the exposure

30
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,390
to UV lights a lot more UV light

31
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:05,368
exposure on the terrestrial environment

32
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,799
also quick changes in temperature occur

33
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:09,780
the water acts as a great moderator as

34
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,970
temperature well not so much on land air

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,560
temperature can change very quickly and

36
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,989
as the obvious one they can jump to dry

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,040
land this reduced access to water I need

38
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:18,989
to be able to find a way to kind of

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,460
retain and maintain a moist environment

40
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:22,129
there so how are we gonna make this

41
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,298
transition

42
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,280
well organisms need to maintain this

43
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,170
moist environment if organisms cannot

44
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,629
find a way to retain water they defecate

45
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,180
and they die as this poor bird found out

46
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,989
water balloons is the example here able

47
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,810
to retain water

48
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,250
we puncture that thin outer membrane so

49
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,920
recently punctured kind of a cool image

50
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,209
and all that water is gonna spill out

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,899
resulting in a desiccation of the animal

52
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,489
which was not good so the amniotic egg

53
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,009
is the key here this helps maintain a

54
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,839
watery environment this in the Attic a

55
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,219
makes it possible for organism that

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,530
makes the jump from aquatic to a

57
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,478
terrestrial environment the chicken

58
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,460
could not survive initially so this

59
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,459
primitive egg had to precede the

60
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,379
ecological branch the egg needs to be to

61
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,978
create a separate aquatic environment

62
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:10,649
and the MEI egg does just this it fills

63
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,900
in this gap provides this product

64
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,860
environment allowing the organism to

65
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,069
make that jump

66
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,990
from the aquatic environment to that

67
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,340
terrestrial and where access to water is

68
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,560
not as easy so spoiler alert the egg

69
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,150
came before the chicken therefore the

70
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,340
egg had to come before the chicken

71
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,800
because this makes the jump to dry land

72
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,360
possible so I know you may debate this

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,490
you're welcome to add your comments

74
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,820
below hopefully this does provide some

75
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,340
scientific basis for why the egg came

76
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,780
before the chicken hopefully this kind

77
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,670
of settles some of the debate or

78
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,919
annoying YouTube comments it may spark

79
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,129
more comment below I'd love to hear what

80
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,129
you think
