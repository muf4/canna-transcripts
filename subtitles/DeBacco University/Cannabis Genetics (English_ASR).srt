1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,790
he ran over cannabis genetics which as

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:07,889
this kind of DNA puzzle shows still a

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,919
little bit of figuring out is going on

4
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:14,460
in this category in relation

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,890
specifically to cannabis so one of the

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,130
reasons that is is Kanaks genetics have

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,920
been hidden like we see here the

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:25,108
tracking is poor at best and due to the

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,699
lack of applied molecular genetics many

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,800
of the names that are thought to be the

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,929
same may actually be quite different

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,759
from one another and the tracking system

13
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,519
uses base more of word of mouth than

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,619
actual science as we see here was our

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,020
kind of like small grow tent operation

16
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,609
this can be a lot of the source of

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,680
certain genetics or source of certain

18
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,269
varieties and sometimes there's poor

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,189
labeling involved or people sharing

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,859
material or people thinking they're

21
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,750
sharing certain material and as a result

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,609
those genetics or those actual lineages

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,280
have kind of become a little bit hidden

24
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:59,729
kind of have an idea but not really a

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,260
true tracking system so Philo's is a

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,089
company that's community canvass in

27
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,768
genetics and then highlighted here and

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,118
they offer services and when they

29
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,240
mention these serene a little bit of

30
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,040
detail plant sex test genotype test in

31
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,500
the filos galaxy which is really

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,170
interesting so let's first look at the

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,450
plant sex test this allows growers to

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,450
cull out male plants from a set block of

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,180
seeds very early typically have to grow

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,310
our plants to very still a flower in

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,110
India to tell Oh male female flowers but

38
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,509
this allows us to be culled out much

39
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,310
earlier using DNA based method the

40
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,650
presence of a y chromosome to be

41
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,509
identified early the seedling stage this

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,549
will allow the elimination of the

43
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,829
worthless plants and as you can kind of

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,079
see right here here's our male this it

45
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:46,408
just flies x and y chromosome as a male

46
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,179
females have two X chromosomes this

47
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,020
reduces the wasted time we can call it

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,829
the male's early and wasted time and

49
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:55,319
resources and plants that will not

50
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,258
produce any valuable yield the cost is

51
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,508
about $60 per four samples which may be

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,129
cost prohibitive in small operations but

53
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,299
if there's a large operations or taking

54
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,849
care of those plants can get very

55
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,030
expensive this is a great way to cull

56
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,438
out

57
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,610
males especially if you're starting from

58
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:13,378
a large block of seats in the genotype

59
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,800
test this allows growers to get a report

60
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,019
of their

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,060
plants unique genetic makeup can be used

62
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,530
to identify and clone matches and how

63
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,020
the plant material relates to other

64
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,539
known cultivars but this information

65
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,610
growers can provide the cultivars could

66
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,129
prove the cultivars that they have and

67
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,830
provide people with information that

68
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:35,129
they have background on what their

69
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,770
actual genetics are this can also help

70
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:40,259
make beneficial breeding decisions if

71
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,090
you have a known set of genetics the

72
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,679
data collected also gets uploaded into

73
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,710
the galaxy o2 when I mentioned a bit

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,360
which is shared collection of genetics

75
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,080
for a community database now this is

76
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,060
$295 per sample

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,390
especially for companies that may be

78
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,469
shipping out clones be great to

79
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,659
incorporate this or if you're receiving

80
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,000
clones from someone maybe to request

81
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,549
this as a way to know the actual genetic

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,759
makeup of the material that you're

83
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,290
receiving the fattest galaxy so this

84
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,329
contains many data points that may take

85
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,679
a little time to load properly so I put

86
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,060
the link down here at the bottom and I

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,189
highly recommend you take a look at this

88
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,319
just again be patient may take a little

89
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,719
while to load it's a large data set I

90
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,909
suggest you simply type a name like og

91
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,219
cush and see how many different samples

92
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:29,189
that you come up with select one and

93
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,620
you'll see report states close genetic

94
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:34,770

the relatives provides an idea of

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,480
immediate and non immediate relatives

the novelty score how common or rare the

100
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,849

such a skunk very landrace OG Kush hemp

105
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:01,050
and CBD the variation the amount of head

106
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,509

107
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,580
stable the cultivar may be velocity

108
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,799
distant varieties provides an idea what

109
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,780
the most genetic different varieties

110
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,180
which may help indicate but make it

111
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,800
interesting crosses in the future so can

112
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,168
I have it committee to take a look at

113
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,509
this website give us some time to load

114
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,339
but type in some varieties and you can

115
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,079
see some of the variability and also

116
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,299
some background information on this

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,609
hopefully this is one step closer to

118
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,150
starting to build a dataset for cannabis

119
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,150
and genetics
