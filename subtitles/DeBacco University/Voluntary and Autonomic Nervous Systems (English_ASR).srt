1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,889
here we're looking at the voluntary in

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,080
the autonomic nervous system and see how

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,239
this relates and connects to the central

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,169
and peripheral nervous systems looking

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,019
it down here our autonomic in our

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,210
somatic systems this kind of key here

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,320
the green is the structure so for our

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,640
central nervous system the main

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,589
structure is the brain and spinal cord

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,599
and of course the function of those is

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:29,429
to integrate and as control centers so

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,939
looking specifically our autonomic and

13
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,890
our somatic nervous systems well this is

14
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,109
relating to systems that we have

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,780
voluntary comodo control over and

16
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,549
involuntary control over so a voluntary

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,679
control will be an example of impulses

18
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,628
from the central nervous system going to

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,450
skeletal muscles for the movement we

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,968
have control over and then involuntary

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,730
there should be muscles such as smooth

22
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,359
muscle that do move and do contract but

23
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:59,939
are not under our direct control now

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,128
specifically the voluntary nervous

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,479
system relays commands the skeletal

26
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,819
muscles and can be controlled by

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,219
conscious thought however reflexes are

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,989
rapid involuntary movements there are

29
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,719
rapid because the sensory neuron passes

30
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,938
information directly to the motor neuron

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,368
she here at the kind of the knee-jerk

32
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:21,089
test where if you hang your knee over

33
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,739
like a chair or a table and take a

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,170
little hammer and hit the tendon just

35
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,629
below the kneecap that will be a prime

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,299
example of this process and your label

37
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,280
kick out this must involve single

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,320
connection inter neurons between sensory

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,540
and morden neurons and like I said the

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,679
prime example is here and you could try

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,770
this for yourself continuing on we also

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,280
have within the autonomic nervous system

43
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,879
we have two pathways we have a parasitic

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,189
synthetic pathway and a synthetic

45
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,739
pathway so our parasympathetic nervous

46
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:58,589
system specifically is related to

47
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,379
controlling normal functions it also is

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,990
related to conserving energy we see that

49
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,078
with a reducing heart rate steam

50
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,149
activity of digestive organs

51
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,459
constricting urinary bladder in contrast

52
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,770
to that are somatic nervous system this

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,250
pathway is kind of like the opposite it

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,860
can increase the heart rate it can kind

55
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,689
of inhibit activity of digestive organs

56
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,730
so here we're students saying that

57
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,750
stimulate activity digestive here we

58
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,679
kind of have an inhibition effect

59
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,210
neither of these can be controlled by

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,250
conscious thought for example your

61
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,430
pupils that constricting or dilating

62
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,599
don't have direct control over that

63
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,340
composed of elements that act in

64
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,019
opposition to one another and that's the

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,900
key point here there's a way to

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,090
constrict the pupils of your eye we need

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,819
a way to dilate the pupils of your eye

68
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,300
you want to increase your production of

69
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,639
saliva

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,340
we need to inhibit that so these kind of

71
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,250
play off one another the synthetic

72
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,620
pathway typically dominates in a time of

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,080
stress and it controls the flight fight

74
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,879
or flight reaction and also increase

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,030
blood pressure heart rate and breathing

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,219
as an example now comparing our

77
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,259
autonomic nurse our somatic effort

78
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:14,340
pathways well we kind of see them

79
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:17,750
evident here and both of these are kind

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,099
of a long operate along the same lines

81
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,469
they're essentially the same

82
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,879
what's different is what branches that

83
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,759
they're involved in what exact

84
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,949
connections that they make so for

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,649
example our dynamic efferent pathway

86
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,709
here we have this connection between the

87
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,349
neuron to the ganglion which then forms

88
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,840
a second production projection from the

89
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,030
gangway onto the target effector so it

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,039
essentially here there's an intermediate

91
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,959
that's occurring we see this kind of

92
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,699
connection and intermediate before we're

93
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,550
actually getting to the target effector

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,409
in this case smooth muscle in this

95
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,540
example here our somatic reflexes for

96
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:58,409
instance involved a direct connection

97
00:03:54,539 --> 00:04:00,780
from the spinal cord to skill to muscle

98
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,299
and this is a Linus direct connection

99
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,110
here and here's our synapse

100
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,580
there's no intermediate so this would be

101
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,850
example here the target effector is a

102
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,530
smooth muscle having this intermediate

103
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:15,329
tingly on a neuron and here we have this

104
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,759
direct connection between our spinal

105
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,859
cord and our skeletal muscle which would

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,858
be under voluntary control
