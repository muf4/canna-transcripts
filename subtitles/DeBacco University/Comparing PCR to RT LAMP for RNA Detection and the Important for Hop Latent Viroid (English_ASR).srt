1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
so on this debaco University video If

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,939
you're looking at detecting whether or

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,200
not you have hot plate and viroid I'm

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,260
going to provide a brief overview

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,419
comparing PCR to RT lamp for RNA

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,599
detection which one you might choose and

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,599
why

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,160
[Music]

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,679
all right let's get into a brief

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,320
comparison of PCR to RT lamp where we're

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,179
looking at detecting hoplate and thyroid

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,000
so first off we have to understand what

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,259
these actually refer to in mean so the

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,359
first one we're going to look at is PCR

15
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,759
which stands for polymis chain reaction

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,859
this has primers that are specific to a

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,960
nucleic acid region and if present and

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,000
positive binding occurs it'll be copied

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,399
multiple times exponentially producing

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,079
the original sequence this can not only

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,878
determine if the sequence is present or

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,280
not but with other detective

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,378
instrumentation the severity or how many

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
particles were present at the start can

25
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,698
also be known this can allow us to

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,698
determine whether there's a low or high

27
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,558
viral or in this case viroid load on

28
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,298
that plant so it kind of goes through

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,640
and repeats repeats repeats this can

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,680
exponentially produce and then how many

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
cycles you can tell how many sequences

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,760
we originally started with

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,919
now PCR is also referred to as a

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,080
thermocycler because it takes one or at

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,719
least theoretically one piece of DNA or

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,579
RNA and makes many many many copies of

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,978
it it's a cycle it's a thermocycler it

38
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,079
changes temperature this thermostat

39
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,539
cycler is known to maximize a

40
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,158
replication cycle

41
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,719
and temperature is changed to allow the

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
attack polymerase to effectively bind

43
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,798
and replicate The Strand so by having

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,959
different temp temperatures cycling

45
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,020
through those are allowing for different

46
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,059
rounds of this nucleic acid replication

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,879
that's how it gets the term thermocycler

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,320
we're getting that kind of Cycles goes

49
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,699
through here temperatures and it repeats

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,019
and it repeats and it repeats and

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,200
repeats

52
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,179
PCR testing itself is a molecular

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
testing that has to be performed if

54
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,220
detection of a viroid is the goal this

55
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,739
can also work for viruses as well

56
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,959
they're done in very very small tubes as

57
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,639
a result you can do many many tests at

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,919
one time going through that same

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,679
thermocycler

60
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,280
now RT lamp a little different a little

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,340
more uh longer name stands for reverse

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,620
transcription Loop mediated isothermal

63
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,719
amplification that's why RT lamp is just

64
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,360
so much easier of a word to say now

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,580
loopmiated isothermal implication is DNA

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,099
application method that allows for rapid

67
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,500
and sensitive detection of a specific

68
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,878
Gene lamp merge with reverse

69
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,219
transcription that's how it gets the RT

70
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:40,259
before it has been successful for use

71
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,598
for the detection of several respiratory

72
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,179
RNA viruses and now it's being also

73
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,039
applied onto others use a different

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,659
enzyme and PCR that offers the advantage

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,120
of being effective at one temperature

76
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,519
and not the cycling of temperatures as I

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
said PCR is also known as a thermocycler

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,659
it's changing those temperatures this

79
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:01,139
can operate at a consistent temperature

80
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,060
making it a little easier there

81
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,699
now what this allows to be a little

82
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,800
easier for is actually field testing the

83
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,359
lamp is similar to PCR uses a

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,700
specialized enzyme to amplify the

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,060
thyroid if it's present the downfall is

86
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,459
this enzyme is less sensitive and RT

87
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,560
lamp compared to the more sensitive PCR

88
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,780
though it's good at finding positive

89
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,519
it's not really a good at detecting true

90
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,400
negatives you might get some false

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,900
positives associated with that keep in

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
mind also it is a field testing so

93
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,800
sometimes it's a color change you know

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
how much did the color change there can

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,040
be some interpretation with that as well

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,598
that needs to be taken into

97
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,158
consideration

98
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,539
lastly a lot of people ask well why

99
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,060
don't you just kind of use an antigen

100
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:45,479
test I've got very popular with the um

101
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,519
stars cov2 virus this test for proteins

102
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,619
so this cannot be used for viroids

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,840
unlike viruses because they lack a

104
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,658
co-protein viruses do have a coat

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,580
protein thyroids do not so that's why

106
00:03:54,658 --> 00:04:00,959
this particular test cannot be used

107
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,120
you're dependent on PCR or the RT lamp

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,158
now of those uh which one should you

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,599
choose well PCR is the standard for a

110
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,878
reason is considered to be the most

111
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,759
reliable also provides very quick

112
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,378
results does not need a high number of

113
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,179
virus present in the original sample

114
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,219
technically could work with just one

115
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,560
present but it would still come back

116
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,740
with a positive indication because it's

117
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,300
the amplification process so this is why

118
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,040
this one typically is the one that's

119
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,960
recommended though if you're looking

120
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,580
quickly the RT lamp might be a little

121
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,459
bit more advantageous kind of like in

122
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,959
the field testing per se but really if

123
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:35,579
you want to get a true positive or even

124
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,839
a low level positive particularly if

125
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,719
you're looking at veg plants or early

126
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,138
plants PCR would be the one I would

127
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,139
recommend
