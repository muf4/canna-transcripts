1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
don't let the name fully is small

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,528
intestine this is a very important part

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,009
of the digestive system keep in mind

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:14,250
this also occurs this is where our food

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,198
items are directly entering after they

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,079
leave the stomach even from the stomach

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,359
to the small intestine and then to the

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,788
large intestine so stomach to small

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,519
intestine look at the small intestine a

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,949
little bit more detail it's the bodies

11
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,959
it's called true digestive that and what

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,160
does that mean well that is just that

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,289
kind of area of that mixing pot there of

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,558
where all of this food items is kind of

15
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:43,378
mixing occurring digested and also very

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,119
importantly absorbing that breakdown of

17
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,009
large molecules into smaller ones which

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,409
are then absorbed into directly into the

19
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,119
bloodstream the total length of the

20
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,549
small intestine is about nineteen and a

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,269
half feet there were about six meters so

22
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:59,369
it's quite the long tube that we have as

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,989
part of the digestive tract now within

24
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,030
that small intestine we have our villi

25
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,728
we also have our micro villi highly

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,560
increasing that surface area we see our

27
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:12,539
blood capillaries our venules are

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,549
allowing for this kind of increase in

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,950
surface area to help the body more

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,470
efficiently absorb nutrients because

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,109
that's a very important component of the

32
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,500
small intestine now what does that look

33
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,688
like

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,849
histology I have that kind of cutaway

35
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:30,658
here of our villi and our muscle layers

36
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:32,699
are absorbs sort of surface our lacteals

37
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,490
our capillaries or arteries or goblet

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,070
cells there's a lot going on in this

39
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,169
small intestine we can see that when all

40
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,059
the images here we can see the folds

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,609
that are occurring we can see the villi

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,469
and all that time graph here the micro

43
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,259
villi does they are really small here

44
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,269
these are the dots and all of this again

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,000
it's helping increase the surface area

46
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,408
to help the body be able to absorb which

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,420
is a very important function of the

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,259
small intestine nutrients more

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,549
efficiently so the starting with the

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,340
small intestine we just left the stomach

51
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,930
we're going to the duodenum this is the

52
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,939
first 10 inches approximately four

53
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,890
percent of the small intestine

54
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,389
Isis closest to the stomach is the

55
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:17,079
mixing bowl four pieces

56
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:19,179
be kind off in the stomach and digestive

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,819
secretions from the pancreas and also

58
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,159
the liver on close proximity near the

59
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:26,079
duodenum is the actual site of digestion

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,939
the pancreas secretes important

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,890
digestive enzymes there's many of them

62
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,020
the liver secretes bile salts into it

63
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:34,239
that make it easier for fats to be

64
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,850
digested it's also a separate video

65
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,260
lecture on liver there or even there's a

66
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,169
little bit more about what that secretes

67
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:42,549
and also the pancreas functions of the

68
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:44,379
dividing them it receives the time again

69
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,570
from the stomach first portion of the

70
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,579
small intestine it also is very

71
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,930
important that it neutralizes the acids

72
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,550
before they damaged if you have highly

73
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,189
absorbent of surfaces of the small

74
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,410
intestine to increase that pH from that

75
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,539
pH of 2 we need to bring it up a little

76
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:04,719
bit to that more closer to neutral and

77
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:06,819
even slightly basic moving on the

78
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,849
jejunum is the middle part of the small

79
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,500
intestine that's about 8.2 feet long in

80
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,389
this location there is chemical

81
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,239
digestion and also a very important

82
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:18,279
nutrient absorption that's occurring we

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,799
could see here the transverse section

84
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,829
how high that surface area to volume

85
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,530
ratio is and as this allowing food

86
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,260
passing through to very easily be

87
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,060
absorbed into the body very small villi

88
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:33,039
lots of these little kind of finger like

89
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,780
projections allowing the food passes

90
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,689
through for that to be absorbed in the

91
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,699
capillaries continuing on there the

92
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:41,709
ileum this is the final segment of the

93
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,959
small intestine this is also important

94
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,590
for absorption it's about eleven and a

95
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,269
half feet long well there's sphincters

96
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,729
that control the flow of material in the

97
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,799
ileum into the large intestine the

98
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:55,449
presence of goblet cells you see one

99
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,489
right here in a little zoom in here

100
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,518
these secrete mucus like seven's is

101
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,230
called mutants in the wall of a phillium

102
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,569
villi so again we also have this

103
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:06,099
important for secretion they help keep

104
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:09,239
everything lubricated as we're working

105
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:11,409
our way through the digestive process

106
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,719
lastly in our small intestine we have

107
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:17,038
intestinal secretions or watery soup you

108
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:19,779
know 1.8 liters per day enter this

109
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:22,389
intestinal lumen it moistens the kind

110
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,728
buffers acids we don't want to burn are

111
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,159
very important absorb ative surfaces

112
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:30,069
keeps digestive enzymes impressive

113
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,810
in solution it is the movements that

114
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,930
kind of arrives in the duodenum right

115
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,790
out of the stomach week Paris taluk

116
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,250
action here moving it towards the

117
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,110
jejunum this is not under central

118
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,660
nervous system control right instead of

119
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,300
that smooth muscle helping mix and move

120
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,430
our food after we leave the small

121
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,120
intestine we're then going to enter the

122
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,120
large intestine
