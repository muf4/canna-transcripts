00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,569
I was recently at CVS going through the

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,939
candy aisle when I flipped over one of

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,000
the labels and saw this where it says

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:14,518
product of Mexico I was a little

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,948
surprised at that and then as I looked

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,410
at some other candies on the rack you

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,720
notice there were other countries so

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,300
that asks the question do you know where

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,129
your candy comes from so the eight candy

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,649
said I was looking at and purchased are

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:32,159
the presented right here gummy bears

12
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:34,289
double bubble sour jacks peppermint star

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,789
lights so on and so forth but what

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,128
surprised me the most was these came

15
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,500
from totally different countries of the

16
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,170
world so I put a world map here so you

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,500
can take a look the eight countries with

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,710
little arrows highlighted here and going

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,710
through them these eight total ones the

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,000
first one Turkey is we're coming bears

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,609
come from

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,058
so the gummy bears here came from Turkey

23
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:08,099
product of Turkey kind of on second one

24
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:11,310
here Spain Spain is the sour of Jack so

25
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:16,199
these sour Jack's come all the way from

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:21,868
Spain the third one Canada favoring

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,790
country was the bubblegum the only one

28
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:29,400
of all these candies from the United

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:32,719
States worthy mini lollipops these are

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,219
the only ones that say product of USA

31
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:40,679
south of the border in Mexico thirteen

32
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:46,009
you saw before the jelly beans come from

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,750
Mexico Colombia down here

34
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:51,959
Colombia is where the winter remix come

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,680
from again a bit odd they've got a

36
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:58,519
travel all that way seven Argentina this

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,490
far down in the southern hemisphere

38
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:06,179
supplement not exactly sure why the

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,739
permit in Argentina but plenty of those

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,489
and the last one which is kind of a

41
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:13,479
little scary we're eight from China

42
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:17,170
strawberry kasi rope

43
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:21,519
came all the way from China a little

44
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:25,030
scary when it says reading food and it

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,719
goes through in the back and it is a

46
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,009
made in China we see enough stuff over

47
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,729
here in the United States made from

48
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:35,709
China getting our candy from China may

49
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:38,889
be worth caution that's with the dog

50
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,379
food isn't that we had of all these

51
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:48,399
eight different ones some are labeled as

52
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:54,789
being genetically modified specifically

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:58,659
on the lower area here down in that

54
00:02:54,789 --> 00:03:03,609
lower area product of genetic

55
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:06,879
modification so a little hard to see the

56
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:13,120
side here produced with genetic

57
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:15,129
engineering and the date is there so

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,590
some of these foods do contain

59
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,479
genetically modified a lot of food that

60
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,069
we consume is genetically modified just

61
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,069
now we're starting to see the labeling

62
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:26,650
for it so I only made this video just to

63
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:29,319
draw your attention of all all these

64
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,099
like it's sitting on racks right in the

65
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,389
same aisle right in the you know think

66
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,069
they're all candies with all the same

67
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:38,589
packaging everything looks about the

68
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,569
same well if you start to look at where

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,750
it comes from you might want to

70
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:46,449
second-guess exactly where or what

71
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,340
candies you're purchasing so the

72
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,939
question is do you know where your candy

73
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,939
comes from
