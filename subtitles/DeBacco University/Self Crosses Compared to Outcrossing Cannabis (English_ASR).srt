1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
all right welcome to this tobacco

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,559
university video here we're going to be

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,960
investigating

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,160
self crosses compared to outcrossing in

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
cannabis plants

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,519
and this is a scientific research study

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,880
so i'm going to be presenting some data

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,359
as almost some pictures

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,240
to help you understand the differences

10
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,198
between these two

11
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,519
and how they impact cannabis so starting

12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,359
with

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,960
the research article that i pulled the

14
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,880
information from we could see the

15
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
abstract listed here

16
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,079
a link and source is cited here and i'm

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,240
going to try to give you a general

18
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,399
summary of this article

19
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,479
so first off so i have to define what

20
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,719
kind of outcrossing and self-crossing is

21
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,238
and

22
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,079
sometimes self-crossing is simply

23
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,159
referred to as cellphone

24
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
so an outcross let's start there is when

25
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,519
two unrelated or at least

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
distantly related plants are bred or

27
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
crossed together

28
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
the outcrossing increases the genetic

29
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,599
variability and we can see that here we

30
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,238
have different individuals

31
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,198
mixing up the genes compared to

32
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,679
self-crossing

33
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,119
this is when the maternal and pollen

34
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,359
from the parents are the same

35
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,358
genotype the goal is to reduce the

36
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
potential for genetic variability

37
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
and this is different than cloning which

38
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,679
is an asexual form of vegetative

39
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
propagation so keep in mind that

40
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
cell thing or self-crossing is not the

41
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
same as cloning

42
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
it's reducing the genetic variability

43
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
where cloning is almost an identical

44
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,559
copy there are so little different

45
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,798
procedures

46
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,960
in this case we're just reducing the

47
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,118
chance at variability

48
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,879
so when is cell thing used in particular

49
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,200
well

50
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,759
for hemp feminized seed producers often

51
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
use sulfine to maintain a strained name

52
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,599
the process of selfing a cannabis plant

53
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
may lead to inferior plants for

54
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,798
cannabidiol or cbd production so that's

55
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,239
kind of what we're

56
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,000
looking at here is yes we're using this

57
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,679
maybe to maintain a strained name

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,719
but is that also going to reduce or

59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
negatively impact cbd production

60
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,000
so when we're looking at the self versus

61
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,680
outcrossing

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
kind of examples here and here we can

63
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
see some great images

64
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,439
so the self progeny here were

65
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,560
significantly smaller than outcross

66
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,000
providing for all

67
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
measured traits and i think we just look

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,519
at the image here the letter a and

69
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
letter b being l crosses and

70
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,280
here letter c representing self crosses

71
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,679
we can see a stark difference

72
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,680
well the study goes on to say that the

73
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,439
self-progeny here

74
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,239
compared to the outcrossed was about

75
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,318
half of the height had fewer internodes

76
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,640
reduced internode length half the leaf

77
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,878
area half the total dry weight delayed

78
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,759
by seven days in flower development

79
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,959
36 percent less floral dry weight equal

80
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,359
cbd producers

81
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
both met the legal limit of 0.3 percent

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,840
thc

83
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
so just note that while there is these

84
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,400
stark differences is a limit with any

85
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
scientific study there's always some

86
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
sort of limit with this one it is that

87
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,639
the study was only looking at three

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
strains

89
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,679
and the primitive three crosses were

90
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,599
evaluated

91
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
now looking we saw the stark differences

92
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,719
there but now if we kind of look at the

93
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,400
numbers we're kind of looking at the

94
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,919
vegetative and flower growth in yield

95
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
these findings provide the phenotypic

96
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,958
and genotypic data to support that cell

97
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,439
thing in cannabis

98
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,878
induces inbreeding depression so while

99
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,400
there's a lot of numbers here and you're

100
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,039
welcome to pause the video and take a

101
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,680
look at it

102
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,199
i want to just make note that this first

103
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,319
column and the second comment represent

104
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,479
the outcrosses

105
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,359
and this last column represent the self

106
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,399
crosses

107
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,519
and with letters of the same name we're

108
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,280
having basically no

109
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
statistical difference so we can see the

110
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
outcrosses pretty much a's and just a

111
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,239
couple b's in there

112
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,519
for all the self crosses we see the

113
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
beasts and the seas indicating that

114
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,200
there is a significant

115
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,799
difference looking at this by the

116
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,119
fischer's least significant difference

117
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,360
with

118
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
a p-value less than or equal to 0.05 so

119
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
again looking

120
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,318
at some statistics supports what we saw

121
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,199
there with the large images or

122
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,919
phenotypes of the plants now what was

123
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,919
also noticed

124
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,958
in this research study is that all self

125
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,199
progeny exhibited

126
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,280
leaf variegation this is known to be a

127
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,958
recessive genetic trait in higher plants

128
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,799
so that again indicates that there's

129
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,598
probably an accumulation of these uh

130
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,438
recessive genes variation was first

131
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,318
evident at the catalina growth stage you

132
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,158
can see that here

133
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,839
cod leads remember are the seed leaves

134
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,280
for most plants the variation persisted

135
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,200
through day 35

136
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
and however three plants had variegated

137
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,759
leaves until the end of the study so it

138
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,719
might be a prolonged effect there

139
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,639
now self in cannabis looking at induces

140
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,598
inbreeding depression so evidence of

141
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,759
inbreeding depression

142
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,439
in self-cannabis well self-feminized

143
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,879
seed has less vigorous plants and

144
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,120
reduced yield

145
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,879
increased homo sagacity with negative

146
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
recessive traits such as variegation

147
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,079
observed which suggests inbreeding may

148
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
occur more rapidly in hemp

149
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,439
than other crops this just shows an

150
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,399
example here of potential corn plants

151
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,079
we're seeing that

152
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,599
reduced height there that inbreeding

153
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,359
depression does occur in plants but

154
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,199
this study at least indicates it may

155
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,439
occur a little quicker in hemp

156
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,120
crops so we're looking at crossing

157
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,240
different strains can increase yields

158
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
crossing two different strains to

159
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
maintain or increase heterozygosity

160
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,839
could be a strategy to increase yields

161
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
and plants may be more uniform

162
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,119
if crossing within a strain is necessary

163
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,639
growers should consider using two

164
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,560
different genotypes of the strain

165
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,800
to produce feminist seed and maintain

166
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,399
the strain name so just a little kind of

167
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,759
indication there

168
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,038
now what we're looking at for is like if

169
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
you're a grower how does this kind of

170
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,120
relate

171
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,960
how can you kind of apply this

172
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
information well hemp breeders may want

173
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,959
to consider developing inbred parental

174
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
lines to generate f1 feminized seed

175
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,638
which could produce plants that exhibit

176
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
improved crop uniformity and

177
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
hybrid vigor it may be beneficial for

178
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,600
feminized seed producers to use

179
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
outcrossing instead of selfing to

180
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
generate feminist seed

181
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,199
for cbd production so that's kind of

182
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
just a general overview here looking at

183
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,919
hemp

184
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,719
compared to self-crossing and

185
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,719
outcrossing
