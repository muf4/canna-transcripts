1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
have you ever wondered about

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,719
concentrates and live concentrates made

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
from cannabis

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,480
well this debacle university video will

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,000
provide you with some information so you

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,160
can develop an understanding

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,839
about these products

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,359
[Music]

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,439
let's look at concentrates and live

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,679
concentrates made from cannabis

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,640
so first off i want to thank ct pharma

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,160
here because

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
they're providing current and publicly

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,839
available and analytical reports

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,759
for the products they produce and the

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,520
descriptions options and uses are

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,119
intended on this video to provide an

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,879
understanding of some of the end

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,199
products of that cannabis plant

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,159
it's important to understand at the end

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,679
that you should have

22
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,119
an analytical report with anything

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,920
you're looking at purchasing associated

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,000
with cannabis

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
ct farmer does a great job of showing

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,119
that and i'll show you an example of

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,800
that at the very end

28
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,399
so first off what's the description of

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,959
our concentrates and our

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,640
live concentrates well they can be

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
extracted into many different ways

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
and come in all different consistencies

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
and textures they are highly potent

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,239
concentrate mass

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
that often has a color similar to like a

36
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,920
buddy of butter or

37
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,199
honey there also are many different

38
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,960
forms of extracts

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
ranging from glass-like textures or

40
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,519
shatter to soft buttery textures such as

41
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,559
batter to ultimately a soft crumbly

42
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,719
texture as

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,478
the name implies a crumble live

44
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,239
concentrates are extracted in a unique

45
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,679
method involving flash freezing

46
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,199
this method preserves many of the

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
flavors and trichomes from the original

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,000
plant material

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,438
when compared to other original methods

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
now concentrates in life concentrates

51
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,359
what are some of the options and this is

52
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
just kind of a brief overview here

53
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,359
again it was found on ct pharma's site

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,719
welcome to check them out

55
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,519
if you want to learn more but there are

56
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,759
several options and we see them all kind

57
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,879
of

58
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
listed here but concentrates located at

59
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,319
the top

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
and then live concentrates what's

61
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,839
important to keep in mind is if we look

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,438
at the strength of all of them they are

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079
listed as high

64
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,639
simply because this is a concentrate so

65
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,279
they are

66
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,478
concentrating just that profile

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,519
concentrating that

68
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,000
cbd concentrating that thc in the sense

69
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,878
that a

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,639
little can go a very long way now what

71
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,639
are the uses of these concentrates

72
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,799
well the concentrates fail on ct pharma

73
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,639
can be vaporized or combined with flour

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,879
vaporizers are available in many forms

75
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,679
such as electronic like an e-rig or

76
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,639
glass versions now when i talked about

77
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,640
earlier that is

78
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,919
important of the kind of paperwork that

79
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,279
goes along with it

80
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,799
and here we're seeing our microbial

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,719
analysis heavy metal microtoxin

82
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,560
pesticide all passing those

83
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,800
as well as the terpene and cannabinoid

84
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,199
profile many people will just look at

85
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
this

86
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,280
we also have to be mindful of matching

87
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,079
up product descriptions and lot numbers

88
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,439
to also the passing of all of the

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
microbiology

90
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,560
pesticides microtoxin testing as well

91
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
now this

92
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
often comes summarized on a label or

93
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
should come summarized on a label as we

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
see here

95
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,318
but it's important here looking at the

96
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,239
label realizing it

97
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,439
understanding what it's showing and also

98
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
having access to

99
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,120
or knowing where to find the original

100
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
documentation where those numbers came

101
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,439
from

102
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,878
this is just again that combination

103
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,479
there of being an

104
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,479
informed consumer
