1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
okay here looking at foliar feeding man

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,910
this just as the name implies and mouse

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,550
feeding the leaves are feeding the

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,019
foliage of your plant we're going to go

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,630
over a little bit about some of the

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,429
basics of this process so first off

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,440
involves the simple act of applying

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,019
fertilizer on the actual leaf surface

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,300
often diluted application rates of 1 to

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,460
100 or greater are often suggested

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,719
anything higher concentration that when

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,429
you're applying it to the leaves on

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,379
depending again what product you're

14
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,329
using but you increase the odds of

15
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,919
burning the leaves you want to be

16
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:34,349
mindful in applying things to the leaves

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,600
that the odds of burning can increase

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,870
there's ways we can go about reducing

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,219
that and one is through dilution rate

20
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:42,929
that means the equipment you're using so

21
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,820
the finer the water droplet the better

22
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:46,229
the coverage the plants will get in the

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,238
more efficient application of the

24
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,369
product hand pump sprayers are very

25
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,439
entry-level they're easy to get they're

26
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,689
very cost effective but they tend to

27
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,670
produce larger water droplets if you're

28
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,799
looking at misters or foggers are often

29
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,890
recommended because of that fine

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,538
water droplet that they're creating

31
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,609
increasing the interaction of that

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,950
particular product and the leaf surface

33
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,890
which allows it to be taken up much more

34
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,868
efficiently now looking at the time of

35
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,909
day that you apply is also an important

36
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,109
consideration you want to watch out for

37
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,880
periods of high heat and light

38
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,650
intensities as these can increase the

39
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,899
odds of burning the leaves no matter

40
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,728
what product you're using typically

41
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,770
early early morning or late evening for

42
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,688
outdoor growers is recommended to reduce

43
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,399
the burning but also increase the

44
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,739
efficiency due the higher percentage of

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,150
leaf stomata being open Symone are

46
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,039
basically pores in the leaf and if

47
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,689
they're open you can get that particular

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,909
product that you're applying into the

49
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,649
leaf a lot more efficiently I mentioned

50
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,570
this is for outdoor growers early

51
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,740
morning we're looking at for indoor

52
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,199
growers yeah

53
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,519
soon before maybe lights come on or

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,890
definitely at least not during peak

55
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,899
lighting maybe just kind of before they

56
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,750
come on or just after they go off maybe

57
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,670
other options for some indoor growers to

58
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,090
maximize foliar feeding and minimize

59
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,890
damage also for foliar feeding new

60
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,960
spreaders and stickers what a spreader

61
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,210
is is it reduces the surface tension to

62
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,919
allow for the applied products reduce

63
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,739
flat droplets increased amount of leaf

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,709
surface interaction literally this is a

65
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,140
normal water droplet it spreads that

66
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,700
to create that nice interaction you

67
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,988
could see here here's our entire product

68
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,929
we're only having this level of

69
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,370
interaction here having ideally the same

70
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,769
volume of water but a lot greater

71
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,329
interaction could see the extreme

72
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,150
example here we're having again that

73
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:32,718
minimum interaction that spreaders will

74
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,400
help spread that out this is because

75
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:37,138
leaves how the waxy surface to them

76
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,539
which is hydrophobic which is repelling

77
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,030
the water so spreader helps kind of

78
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,188
negate some of the negatives the polar

79
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,500
compounds of water and helps spread them

80
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:47,818
out to increase that interaction there's

81
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,250
also something called stickers and these

82
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,589
reduce the chance of water splash from

83
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,900
washing off the plant leaf surface it

84
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,878
literally will help them adhere or stick

85
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,010
to the leaf surface so if you have a

86
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,959
spreader sticker combination then only

87
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,500
you're getting the higher contact of our

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,090
spreader

89
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,889
but the sticker is actually making it

90
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,709
adhere to the leaves a little bit more

91
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,329
efficiently the benefits of these better

92
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,878
stickers again help increase the contact

93
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:14,099
between the liquid and the leaf surface

94
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,780
makes the products more effective so

95
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,358
this can be a great way to maximize that

96
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,908
use of the product and ensure that that

97
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,370
leaf is getting a very even coverage

98
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:24,929
throughout however the drawbacks is some

99
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,158
products are not recommended to be mixed

100
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,870
with spreader stickers so know what

101
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,120
product you're using and know if there

102
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,449
is any potential negative interactions

103
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,560
with adding that such product you also

104
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:36,540
sweater stickers can make some products

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,269
work what's called to well it increases

106
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,650
the odds of burning so sometimes if

107
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,500
you're using a spreader sticker I'm

108
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,759
going to cut back on the dilution I want

109
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,389
to increase that dilution rate a little

110
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:50,279
bit more and cut back on maybe go with a

111
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,019
very small amount or smaller amount as

112
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,329
you work your way up to reduce the

113
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,259
chance of spray damaging or grower you

114
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,959
know induced plant leaf burning through

115
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:03,539
the use of all of your feeding which can

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,639
be effective at increasing especially if

117
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,289
there's deficiencies but we want to be

118
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,540
mindful of some of the concerns that are

119
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,650
also associated with it and typically

120
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,568
this is a little bit more of a quicker

121
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,430
fix want to be managing the vast

122
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:18,019
majority of our nutrients through the

123
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,019
growing media that we're choosing to use
