1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
okay here I look at preparing and

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,389
selecting clones image here was not

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,890
chosen by accident all these are females

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,879
and silhouettes because when we're

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,949
selecting clones

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,139
I want to be selecting an outstanding

7
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,570
female plant for its high cannabinoid

8
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,489
production so hooda clone will starting

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,100
out with easy plant such as tomatoes

10
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:22,439
prison Thea's the practice on might be a

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,090
good initial plan to start with the goal

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,980
is to clone a unique individual with

13
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,980
desirable traits to ensure the entire

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,810
planting of superior individuals is

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,308
obtained so as I say start with the

16
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,429
tomatoes or person theists are really

17
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,558
easy and they can help you refine your

18
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,988
techniques before you go on to canvas or

19
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,609
other crops the reason why I want to

20
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,869
select that unique individual is you

21
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,238
want to capture like lightning in a

22
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,308
bottle so you can replicate that one

23
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,429
particular unique individual

24
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:52,198
so you've up a whole crop of those can

25
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,719
you clone auto file although flowering

26
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,609
plants well yes but just because you can

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,189
do it doesn't mean you should you want

28
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,519
to avoid auto flowering plants root

29
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:05,158
Alice in particular is the cultivar

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,868
subset I since these will produce poor

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,060
quality plants due to the natural life

32
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,340
cycle not being easily extended into the

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,409
cloning process so typically we're

34
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,420
looking at non auto flowering plants

35
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,978
being advantageous to clone and trying

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,960
to avoid the auto flowering ones but it

37
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,840
is possible

38
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,548
ideal time for cloning in actuality any

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,990
plant can be clinic any stage of growth

40
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,430
and development but there are more

41
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,188
ordeal times to mechanized production

42
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,509
and efficiency the ideal time is when

43
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:32,669
the mother or stock plant is about at

44
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,680
least one month old we don't want to go

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,030
much younger than that the school is to

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,430
ensure that the traits you want are

47
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,259
expressed and provide plant time to

48
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,680
produce many branches to allow for easy

49
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,329
cloning cloning to early you will simply

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,420
get enough offspring off that initial

51
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,219
stock or mother plant preparing mother

52
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,689
plants for cloning the stock plant has

53
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,759
been fed less nitrogen will help the

54
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,099
today's produce roots faster over

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,200
feeding may produce nice lush growth

56
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,669
vegetative growth in particular but will

57
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
increase the time it takes for that

58
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,899
cutting to actually root ideally the

59
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,030
mother plant should be in the vegetative

60
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,468
stage to reduce rooting time and provide

61
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,419
clones that will not potentially flower

62
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:11,759
early so if we have a mother plant

63
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,348
already flowering will cause a delay in

64
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,799
production since the cuttings must go

65
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,899
kind of

66
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
backwards in the vegetative state before

67
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,250
they then reflowed

68
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,109
so again another plant least a

69
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,169
one-month-old in a vegetative state is

70
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,240
the ideal candidate for a lesser mother

71
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:28,709
plant or stock plant I want to avoid

72
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,689
those high nitrogen's even though they

73
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,060
do produce those deep green robust look

74
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,280
to a plants because canvas can what's

75
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,920
called a luxury consume which means they

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,509
can take in more than the plant needs in

77
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,429
that mention result and delay in the

78
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:43,500
production of roots and also the root

79
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,670
quality might be poor there's a fine

80
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,770
line between too much and too little

81
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,659
nitrogen so when in doubt I suggested to

82
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,700
under feed because you can always add a

83
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,669
little bit more it's very difficult to

84
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,649
take away selection tip when selecting

85
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,780
that unique individual with renewable

86
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,260
states for replication you want to pick

87
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,060
out that one special plant cloning just

88
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,489
an average plant will result in average

89
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,140
offspring you want to multiply a plant

90
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,210
that is unique and can be difficult to

91
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,579
find when looking at natural plant

92
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,080
select the stem that is still useful but

93
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,480
nearing maturation to help reduce

94
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,860
rooting time now say select that unique

95
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,439
individual it's very easy in this case

96
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,790
to select unique individual but here we

97
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,829
have this field of sunflowers might be a

98
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:25,949
little more difficult so it could be a

99
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,410
slightly taller plant the one producing

100
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,449
more petals could be one that flowers

101
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,280
earlier instead of later so there's

102
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,349
different nuances you want to take into

103
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,120
consideration with a larger population

104
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,829
you're more likely to find one unique

105
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,989
individual they're not always as

106
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,700
clear-cut as this but the reason why you

107
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,349
want to select that one individual is

108
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,539
your immigrant a lot of these plants it

109
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,780
was just average well that maybe you can

110
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,250
get from other means plant material that

111
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,870
is not ideal for clones while older

112
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,280
plant material will be slow to root and

113
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,439
may have poor overall root production

114
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,750
and should not be the first go-to

115
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,150
material that's all that you have by all

116
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,229
means use it very young material may

117
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,689
also not be able to support itself

118
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:04,949
through the stressful cloning process so

119
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,709
you kind of want that nice in between

120
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:10,319
that the two young not the too old to

121
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:13,709
allow for increased odds of success in

122
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,959
your clones taking root storing clones

123
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,459
in general I don't recommend it however

124
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,439
if you're transporting plant material

125
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,389
taking fresh cuttings should be placed

126
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,120
in a plastic bag it's been like misted

127
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,099
with water in place about 40 degrees

128
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,540
we're trying to hold them rooting gel

129
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,720
can be applied when we first take

130
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,930
then but that can get very messy and our

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,220
bag so if you take the cuttings to apply

132
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,290
the rooting hormone and put them in some

133
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,720
sort of plug and store the plugs that

134
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,780
could be a way to try to reduce the

135
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,580
stress on that militating cutting that

136
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,529
routing gel initially placed in this

137
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,120
situation just causes a mess if they're

138
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:50,369
not directly placed in the media there

139
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,259
so again we want to try to cut them and

140
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,329
get them into the environment as quickly

141
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,889
as possible some of this is that may not

142
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:57,689
always be the case you can hold them for

143
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:01,589
a little bit but you want to really

144
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:03,209
reduce that duration clone harvest to

145
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:05,279
flower harvest it takes about three

146
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,019
months from a cutting clone to

147
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,759
harvesting flowers again I can vary a

148
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,680
little bit this means you want to aim

149
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,449
for always having about 1/3 of plants in

150
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,610
a vegetative state two-thirds in a

151
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,219
flowering state this will allow you that

152
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,720
continual harvest and kind of allowing

153
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,220
plants to always come in the flower I

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,780
always have a plan for meditative ready

155
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,270
place those always ready to take some

156
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,309
clones have a stock mother plants so it

157
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:30,919
takes a lot of coordination when it does

158
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,920
you can have a nice continual harvest
