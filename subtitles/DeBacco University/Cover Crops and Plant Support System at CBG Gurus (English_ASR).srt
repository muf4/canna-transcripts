1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,159
there are many options when it comes to

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,160
cover crops and supporting plants

3
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:06,798
growing in the field on this tobacco

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,839
University video we're going to go out

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,920
and see how this CBG gurus do both their

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,240
cover cropping method as well as their

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,289
plant

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,289
[Music]

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
support all right so a lot of options

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,519
out there but let's take a look and see

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
one example here how a hemp grower in

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,278
Southern New England handles this so

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
first off who are these CBG gurus well

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,280
they are built around the belief of

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,200
producing a premium Quality Craft hemp

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,520
product they've with the manufacturer of

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,120
stability alignment and alignment with

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,239
nature they use uh wood chips uh

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,679
basically on the ground there to really

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,839
help improve soil quality and structure

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,320
and they also Implement many of the

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,480
Korean natural farming methods as well

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,799
in combination with modern science Sean

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,279
and Jacob have been great uh to kind of

25
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,159
work with and allow me into their field

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,000
I give you their contact information as

27
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,558
well as their website to take a look at

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,719
which will also be in the description in

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,079
addition to kind of the uh CBG groups

30
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,560
who they are some things we're going to

31
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,200
discuss in this particular video is

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,000
going to be the cover crops so while

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,118
different areas can have different uh

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,359
cover crop uh ideal cover crops to

35
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,640
utilize this is a great resource there

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,599
to give you um many different options

37
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,040
we'll see a couple mentioned today but

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,839
this is a great resource also um to take

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,079
a look at there if you're interested in

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
cover cropping uh fields and lastly the

41
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,798
plant support system that they utilize

42
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,199
they use trellis netting they simply

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
take trellis netting and mount it

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,399
horizontally kind of use a modified

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,600
screen of green method with the key to

46
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,840
basically make this system work is

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,039
really the heavyduty metal stakes that

48
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,359
they use on the ends and throughout the

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,840
field to really give that some support

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,680
there so hopefully you find this

51
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,880
information useful and interesting and

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
here we go out to the

53
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,039
field okay so what we see here is a very

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,758
unique cover cropping system not only do

55
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,079
we have um mulch here wood chips

56
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,479
essentially to protect the ground from

57
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,079
moisture loss and weeds we also see

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,200
integrated cover crops as well now we

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
have a diversified group of cover crops

60
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,039
so we've got oats here which you know

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,598
we're getting into Late July early

62
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,000
August and you know they're kind of

63
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,639
going by the wayside and they're being

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,479
cut down uh with a weed whacker also

65
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,318
have daon radishes as we can see right

66
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,039
here and something else unique has kind

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,238
of an interplanting we're noticing sweet

68
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,840
potatoes uh they're nice low growing

69
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,519
they're not really competing we can

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,800
clearly see the cannabis plants growing

71
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,759
up and then we've got our nice cover

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,159
crop here that's giving our soil

73
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,639
diversity that's giving a great way to

74
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:47,079
kind of get something established give

75
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,799
something back to the soil and then very

76
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,879
easy to manage from the grower

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280
standpoint so both of those features

78
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,439
make it really nice to have this kind of

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,439
system working

80
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,518
together

81
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,959
so here we see the row uh it's just been

82
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,719
weed whacked and we can kind of see that

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,799
wood chip mulch there at the ground can

84
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,878
also see what an easy knockdown it is

85
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,120
for those selected cover crops now

86
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,560
here's a daon radish a little late here

87
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,920
in the summer but we can see one

88
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,080
actively growing right there can also

89
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:24,479
see remnants of past um crops as well

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,799
daon radishes as well as some old

91
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,280
potatoes all of this is giving this area

92
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,200
diversity and we're not really tilling

93
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,640
the soil here in this example

94
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,639
so that's giving everything kind of set

95
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,079
in place those oats go go down really

96
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,399
nice uh obliterate really well and you

97
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,000
can see we're left with this nice

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,599
walking path this is also going to

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,519
suppress soil Splash we can see drip

100
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,399
irrigation if needed and we also see The

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,719
netting here and that's allowing us to

102
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,799
kind of have this support for the plants

103
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,959
metal stakes are strongly advised

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,560
because they are so strong against the

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,319
winds and doing a couple layer system as

106
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,280
we see with some of the mother plants uh

107
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,878
allows us to kind of hold those plants

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,158
in place hold those uh in their

109
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,759
respective areas and then not worry

110
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:11,239
about it now if we do get a wind event

111
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,000
when the plants are below this netting

112
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,759
well they're usually too small to be too

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,839
harmed by it this is only about 2 and

114
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,160
1/2 ft up um so once they get to that

115
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,239
and start working their way through

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
that's when they need the support and

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,720
that's when they will get it with the

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,720
first layer of the

119
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,400
screening

120
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,038
now it's good enough to do once it's

121
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,439
good enough to do many times we can see

122
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:39,279
that nice replication here of the rows

123
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,560
of this nice screening nice TRS netting

124
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,439
it's pretty taut so that's going to hold

125
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,120
it very level it's going to allow us to

126
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,399
allow those plants to grow up it you can

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,240
see here second tier ready to go plants

128
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,239
just coming through that first tier this

129
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,918
is a great way to be very efficient with

130
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,560
your time and really to focus on one row

131
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,038
now to help the Growers also planting

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
the same Variety in each can allow you

133
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,319
to manage those well within each row in

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,280
different rows different varieties

135
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,719
different slight um different care that

136
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,038
they may need but keeping the same

137
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,000
Variety in the row or at least most of

138
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,079
the row will really help you go through

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,199
and be able to be efficient with what

140
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,560
you're setting up metal stakes again

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,439
very much uh advised we have taller

142
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,519
plants shorter plants older plants uh

143
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,639
seeing a nice little mix keeping Good

144
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,599
Records so we know kind of what works

145
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,240
and then hopefully repeat what works

146
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,000
next year on a larger scale now here

147
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,038
we're able to see our mother plants and

148
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,759
we're seeing three tier system of the

149
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,519
screen yeah space pretty evenly to give

150
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,960
those plants support we also have metal

151
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,839
stakes here um to really provide the

152
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,000
entire structure support CU it is on the

153
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,519
end here in case there's a wind event

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,279
see this plants grow right up through it

155
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,079
very well we got a couple just starting

156
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,198
to poke through the second layer we

157
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,478
already have the third layer in place

158
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,639
reason why you want that third layer in

159
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,680
place is you don't want have to be

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,918
worrying about it set it all up once if

161
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,038
you know the plants are going to get big

162
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,279
set it all up at the same time you have

163
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:03,399
to worry about it and you can spend more

164
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,399
time training those plants up through

165
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,879
it
