1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
okay here I'm going to provide a brief

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,439
introduction to forensic science so the

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,719
nature of forensic science well let's

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,089
start with just defining the terms here

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,718
that are included so for example

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,759
forensics is scientific test used in

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,769
connection with the detection of a crime

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,710
and that can as you can see up here I

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,768
can be involving certain laboratory

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,278
techniques we're gonna go over more

11
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,570
details in other videos this can involve

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:33,359
eyewitness testimony and dealing with

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,359
other aspects of that so it's in all

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,789
centered or rounded the detection of a

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,469
crime the other part of that science is

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,899
an intellectual and practical activity

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,730
encompassing the systematic study of the

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,710
structure and behavior of physical and

19
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:48,689
natural world through the observations

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,850
in experiment so a pretty long

21
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,589
definition for a single word there well

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,899
what that science is is kind of that

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,840
application so while forensics is

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,609
detection of a crime using the science

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,579
components this is how we take this

26
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,189
practical and systematic approach to

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,890
analysis or analyzing I should say a

28
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,298
crime scene and how we go about pulling

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,069
out the information identifying

30
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,380
information and developing potential

31
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:20,489
tests to encode for and provide data in

32
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:22,530
detail observations that may be made so

33
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,420
putting it together science as it

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,340
relates to the law so there is that lab

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,500
based component but then there's also

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,780
the law because a lot of times forensic

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,659
science people aren't going in front of

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,210
courts and forgeries in court settings

39
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,729
and they have to be able to argue and

40
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,709
provide evidence that they found through

41
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,049
their work it uses a crime scene

42
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,298
processing protocol and says how can we

43
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,610
go through and how to break down what's

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,850
going on with crime scene to be able to

45
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,379
gain information without altering what

46
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:56,489
might be going on there so it could be

47
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,859
presented in a official base in front of

48
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,468
a jury and a court setting so that's

49
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,938
kind of just a very basics of

50
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:04,468
introduction to forensic science other

51
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,429
videos in this channel will go through a

52
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:07,429
lot more detail
