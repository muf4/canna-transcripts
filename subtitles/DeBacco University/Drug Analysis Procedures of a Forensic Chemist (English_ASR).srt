00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,880
we're going to be looking at drug

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,480
analysis procedures

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:10,399
for a forensics chemist so some of the

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,400
specifics some of the options that might

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,960
be used a little bit some of the lab

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
based

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,240
settings and procedures that be used to

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,439
analyze different drugs brought into the

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,038
lab

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,480
so starting with in order to get that

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,240
material in the lab it first needs to be

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,679
collected so collecting that material

14
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,439
that you're going to send to the lab

15
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,518
while individual labs may have specific

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,159
handling procedures the following

17
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,238
is intended to provide a basic overview

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,679
of the drug analysis procedure

19
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,759
so depending on the very specific type

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,039
of drug saying the type of lab you might

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,799
be going to there might be

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,479
greater detail this is meant to provide

23
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,878
a general guide

24
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,319
so step one is to determine the amount

25
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,439
of material more

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,000
is not necessarily always better

27
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,599
evidence submitted can vary widely in

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,439
the amount that's collected

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,520
so by finding the total mass of the

30
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,000
material this can determine what tests

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,079
can be

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
and cannot be done due to the amount of

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
material there is to work with

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,960
so where in doubt try to collect this

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
quote

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,839
much as you can within reason because

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,600
that may limit the amount of steps

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
that can be done or procedures carried

39
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,399
out but this isn't always the case you

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
want to make sure that you're only

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,040
collecting

42
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,879
the isolation of material you don't want

43
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
to have other contaminants in there

44
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,879
this is why more is not always better

45
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,959
but the amount that you can collect

46
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,079
will limit or potentially determine what

47
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,798
tests will be carried out

48
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,519
from there initially you might do a

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,759
presumptive

50
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,039
test so this is the goal of screening

51
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,439
out the material

52
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
to classify into a general category

53
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,118
common perceptive test

54
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,640
microscopic analysis micro crystal

55
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,759
analysis and ultraviolet

56
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,399
spectrometry as well as some in-field

57
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
test kits if you're looking at specific

58
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
drugs

59
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
that are typically commonly found so

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,118
looking here we have the

61
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,799
microscope analysis this is a visual

62
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:55,759
inspection of the general structure of

63
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,439
the material

64
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,359
the goal is to provide a broad

65
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,758
classification typically it's used for

66
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,438
larger materials such as plant material

67
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,439
because it's not really great at getting

68
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,359
at some of the molecular structures

69
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,439
just more what does it look like under

70
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,840
high power magnification

71
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,759
they can also lead us to microcrystal

72
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,200
analysis and this involves dissolving a

73
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,039
small amount of material

74
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,639
and then allowing crystals to form

75
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,479
viewing the crystals with the aid of

76
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,598
polarized light can help determine their

77
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,919
structure

78
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,079
and this can help classify again that

79
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,679
material and acts as another step

80
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,080
in that analysis process

81
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
they mentioned ultraviolet spectrometry

82
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,560
where we're projecting ultraviolet light

83
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
which is

84
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,159
that nanometers of wavelength of light

85
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,878
and measured uh measuring the absorbance

86
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,878
can help

87
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,878
provide a general classification of that

88
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,359
material so i'm going to react more to

89
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,598
the uv

90
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
light than others and it's also an easy

91
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,839
light source

92
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,439
to carry around and to be used in

93
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
projected in a laboratory setting as

94
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,759
well

95
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,599
then we get into what we call

96
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,959
confirmatory tests and these are used to

97
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,280
identify the material

98
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
and often continue where a presumptive

99
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,759
test left

100
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
off the presentative test will give us a

101
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,759
general idea and then the confirmatory

102
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
test will tell us exactly what it is or

103
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,000
that's at least the intention

104
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,800
is to use or develop a chemical

105
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,878
signature

106
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
and then match that up with a particular

107
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,039
type of substance

108
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,639
now one example that might be used here

109
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,759
is called gas chromatography

110
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,238
or gcs is very commonly used

111
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,000
in laboratory settings so keep in mind

112
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,039
that gas chromatography is a type of

113
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,878
chromatography

114
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,560
used to analyze a chemistry for

115
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,919
separating out and analyzing compounds

116
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,199
that can be vaporized without

117
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,318
decomposition

118
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,798
so this is where that representative

119
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,798
test might come into play because this

120
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,879
might lead you to use if you have

121
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
available gas chromatography

122
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,318
so use typically in forensic and

123
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
analysis with the main use for testing

124
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,238
bodily fluids

125
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
the use of the gc includes testing the

126
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
purity of a particular substance or

127
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,040
separating out

128
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,400
different components of a mixture which

129
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,239
is the relative amount such as

130
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
components can be determined so how much

131
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,280
contaminants might be there

132
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,680
what is the purity of the substance

133
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,199
detected a gas chromatography can also

134
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
be used to identify a compound or

135
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,839
residues from explosives

136
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,719
so again has multiple uses and is a very

137
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
common

138
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,080
method used then we have something

139
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,000
called liquid chromatography

140
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,919
which operates around the same basic

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,439
idea as the gas chromatography

142
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,120
except this is a technique used to

143
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,199
separate samples into its individual

144
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,879
components based on their interactions

145
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,478
of the sample with a mobile and

146
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,478
stationary phase

147
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,478
may have done separation on a very basic

148
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,199
scale like for example inks

149
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,560
uh of pens or for example plant material

150
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
separating out chlorophyll

151
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,478
um these are examples of liquid

152
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,360
chromatography

153
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,079
they have capillary electrophoresis or

154
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,520
abbreviated

155
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,359
ce and this is an analytical technique

156
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,079
that separates ions which are neutral

157
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,639
substances

158
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,719
are not affected so keep that in mind uh

159
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,720
separates these ions based on their

160
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,679
electrophoretic mobility in use in

161
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,240
applied

162
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,959
voltage so if they simply have to have a

163
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
charge

164
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,638
this is because neutral substances will

165
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,319
not be affected we need like a slight

166
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,120
positive or slightly negative charge

167
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,360
here

168
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
this mobility will depend on the charge

169
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,000
of that molecule in addition to the

170
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,478
viscosity

171
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,839
and the atom's radius capillary

172
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,599
electrophoresis is used

173
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,198
predominantly because it gives faster

174
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
results and provide higher resolution

175
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,160
separation

176
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,159
it's a useful technique based on there

177
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,280
is a large range of detection methods

178
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,320
available

179
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,519
so there's some specifics here the rate

180
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,478
at which the particles move is

181
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,799
proportional

182
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,199
to the applied electrical field so this

183
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,759
can allow for greater separation

184
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,038
based on the field strength if two ions

185
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,720
are of the same size

186
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,159
with a greater charge will move faster

187
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
so it allows

188
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,080
a greater degree or specificity of

189
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
separation

190
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,359
and for ions with the same charge the

191
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,439
smaller particle has less friction and

192
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,080
it will have a faster migration rate

193
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,199
so this is what allows this to have a

194
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,079
very high degree

195
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,000
of separation even if some properties

196
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,000
are similar

197
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
the lab equipment used for this compound

198
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
identification

199
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,439
process the only two covered here but

200
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,919
the goal is the same with the ability to

201
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,680
identify specific compounds being tested

202
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,599
each require specific protocols to be

203
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
filed in addition to proper setup

204
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
and maintenance of the material the

205
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,439
equipment

206
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
over a period of time so we have the

207
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,319
mass spec

208
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,919
or mass spectrometry and this is an

209
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,319
analytical method that

210
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,839
employs ionizations and mass analysis of

211
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
the compounds in order to determine the

212
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,478
mass

213
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
formula and the structure of the

214
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,560
compound being

215
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,840
analyzed we can see also this is another

216
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
highly specific process that allows

217
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,599
those compounds to be

218
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,439
more precisely identified that cannot be

219
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,520
done in the field

220
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,800
and then lastly we have infrared

221
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,279
spectrometry which

222
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,038
is analysis using infrared light

223
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,679
interacting with a molecule

224
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,800
so this can be analyzed in three ways by

225
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,519
measuring absorption

226
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,639
emission and also reflection the main

227
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,879
use of this technique

228
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,478
is in organic and inorganic chemistry

229
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,478
it's used by chemists to determine the

230
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,959
functional groups in molecules

231
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,680
so again another great laboratory based

232
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,799
test

233
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,160
to get at specifically identifying

234
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
the compounds in the substance that is

235
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,840
initially brought into the lab
