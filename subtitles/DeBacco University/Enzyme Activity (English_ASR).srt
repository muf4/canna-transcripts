1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
okay here we're looking enzyme activity

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,770
we see in our image here the amount of

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:10,589
energy here required is greater with no

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:13,048
kettles no enzyme and with an enzyme we

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:14,879
see that energy is reduced even though

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,649
we're starting with the same reactants

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,679
and ending with the same products the

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,239
amount of energy required is reduced so

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,018
we want to look at what at what can

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:27,059
impact our enzymes activity so some key

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,409
parts are the order of amino acids

12
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,608
that's why I show that picture of the

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,649
chairs here showing a very specific

14
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,710
order that can impact our enzyme action

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:38,479
the temperature the enzyme is in can

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,429
help and/or hinder our enzymes a pH

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,378
certain enzymes like prefer different pH

18
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,719
is to operate efficiently in then we

19
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,820
have our substrate concentrations and we

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,579
have our enzyme concentrations look at

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,570
these in a little bit more detail here

22
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,579
so starting with the order of amino

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,878
acids the wrong order equals the wrong

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,670
shape equals it not being functional so

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,759
you can see here a list of amino acids

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,689
listed by their three-letter codes here

27
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,250
and the order that these occur in is

28
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,109
very important because that's going to

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,478
determine the shape how these interact

30
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,060
and that is going to form either a

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,438
functional or non-functional protein so

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,840
getting everything in the right order is

33
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,809
very important so that the proper shape

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,109
can be had so that the enzyme can

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,879
produce the proper function temperature

36
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,709
temperature affects the rates of enzyme

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,868
activity there's an optimum temperature

38
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,279
the optimum temperature is the greatest

39
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,709
number of collisions between the enzyme

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,560
of the substrate for the human body our

41
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,599
body temps about 37 degrees Celsius this

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,030
is typically the optimum temperature of

43
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,559
our enzymes we'll notice here the rate

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,629
of reaction as that temperature gets

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,259
colder we see that the rate of reaction

46
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:51,390
decreases what some students forget is

47
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,209
that we have our optimum rate and as it

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,530
gets warmer then we've noticed a large

49
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,259
drop-off here

50
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,478
this is because our proteins are enzymes

51
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,099
in this case our denaturing they're

52
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,899
falling apart they're taking on a

53
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,959
different shape and they're not able to

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,399
perform the proper function so optimum

55
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,829
temperature is that temperature at which

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,909
we have the maximum rate of activity we

57
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,890
reduce the temperature we have less

58
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:16,409
collisions increase that temperature we

59
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,809
denaturing occurring causing these

60
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,629
proteins and enzymes to have the proper

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,580
shape perfect example d matron of

62
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:26,729
proteins gotten to unfold or lose its

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,709
shape is in the taste of the frying an

64
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,989
egg in this case what we're boiling the

65
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,170
egg their amino acids and proteins in

66
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,340
here when we boil the egg we're then

67
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:37,019
changing those shapes and they don't go

68
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,569
back when we cool them it's another

69
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,730
important note to make once we change

70
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,349
the shape of the enzymes they don't also

71
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,349
be cool then they go back once you fry

72
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:48,239
an egg it's kind of that same change of

73
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,310
shape and it was either cooler

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,680
temperatures at lower temperatures

75
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,019
molecules move slower secondly fewer

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,730
collisions between enzymes that's what

77
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,170
you see here the rate of reaction

78
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,719
increases as we increase that

79
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:01,979
temperature how is this certain point

80
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,800
here where we're seeing a decrease

81
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,389
that's causing denaturing to occur DNA

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,040
train is that proteins unfolding or

83
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,009
losing its shape and therefore losing

84
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,689
its function lucia indicated right here

85
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:14,939
as temperature increases we see that

86
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:16,500
increase that optimum rates the peak and

87
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,900
then all of a sudden we have this sharp

88
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,659
decrease as a temperature goes above

89
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,700
that optimum rate so it's not just a

90
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,829
perfect linear curve here there's an

91
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,109
optimum rate and it slows down due to

92
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,439
less collisions and above that

93
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,230
temperature we have denaturing occurring

94
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,750
now pH can also occur cause enzymes to

95
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:39,149
denature most of the enzymes in the

96
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,219
human body function between pH of 6 and

97
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,879
8 but depends where you're located in

98
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,889
the human body

99
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,900
pepsin for example in the stomach as a

100
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,359
peach around 3 and that's what works

101
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,010
best and in the intestines you have more

102
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,510
basic pH around 8

103
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:54,509
so it's enzymes you can perform better

104
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:56,159
at pH 8 we see an example here here this

105
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:58,828
enzyme has an optimum rate right around

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,780
7 you can see as we increase the acidity

107
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,120
or decrease the pH we see that rate of

108
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,180
reaction decreases the same is if we

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,870
increase that pH make it more basically

110
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,790
see the same decrease right here the

111
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,280
substrate concentration so the rate of

112
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:16,978
reaction increases until the point of

113
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,970
saturation so our substrate remember our

114
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,798
substrate in our products were

115
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,539
increasing our substrate therefore we're

116
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,728
increasing the rate of reaction to a

117
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:26,069
certain point here kind of plateaus or

118
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,740
Peaks out kind of will level off at this

119
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,430
rate here

120
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,348
most of the amount of enzyme

121
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,180
concentration so enzyme activity is not

122
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:35,250
always linear it's based on the amount

123
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,538
of substrate so here we have the time

124
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,538
and seconds the amount of product being

125
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:42,089
produced with a first phase here and the

126
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:44,279
amount of enzyme located here so the

127
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:46,468
amount of enzyme can also impact the

128
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,549
concentration enzyme can also impact the

129
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:52,500
rate that products are produced enzyme

130
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,658
shape is imperative each enzyme has a

131
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,418
very specific substrate that it binds to

132
00:04:54,658 --> 00:05:00,509
as a result you need many different

133
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:02,668
types of enzymes to be able to survive

134
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,530
there's many different locks many

135
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:07,198
different doors need many different keys

136
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,089
kind of the same concept here where all

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,430
our enzymes have very specific shapes

138
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:16,288
that bind to very specific substrates

139
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,550
lastly here to change that shape we have

140
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:19,439
something called competitive inhibition

141
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,689
the body needs a way to stop enzymes

142
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,098
from working at times so here we have

143
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:28,050
our site we have our substrate binding

144
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:29,699
to the enzyme and it's binding just here

145
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,009
just fine and it's able to go through

146
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,990
and perform its function no problem

147
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,759
but with this inhibition site so if the

148
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,340
body wants to stop this enzyme from

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,158
working it can take this molecule when

150
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,528
it binds to this inhibition site we

151
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:46,139
notice the active site here changes

152
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:49,019
shape as a result in this case the

153
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,478
substrate may bind but the enzyme can't

154
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,668
perform its function so this would be a

155
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,829
way to inhibit an enzyme without

156
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:57,990
breaking it down necessarily this

157
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,838
inhibitor molecule binds to the site

158
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,718
here and changes can change the shape of

159
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:06,689
the active site or it can cause this to

160
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:08,278
bind but not be able to be broken this

161
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:10,740
is just a way that the normal reaction

162
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:13,500
will occur here just fine and this is a

163
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,139
way that the body can inhibit an enzyme

164
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,269
without necessarily temperature causing

165
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,218
denature or changing the pH at the

166
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:22,079
environment maybe because we don't

167
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:24,209
always want enzymes always working and

168
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,158
