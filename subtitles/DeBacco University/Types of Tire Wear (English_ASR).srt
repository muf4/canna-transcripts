1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,040
so you may wonder why is it important to

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,960
understand different types of tire wear

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,879
well it can apply to your own tires if

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,839
you go out and look at your own tires to

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,679
see how the

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,119
pattern of wear might be occurring can

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,040
get an indication

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,480
of something that you may not have

9
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,519
optimized with your tires

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
or if you find a suspect's car and match

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,160
up the

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,839
evidence at the crime scene with certain

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,240
wear patterns of the tire and they match

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,320
up

15
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,439
it can help strengthen a case against

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
someone

17
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
so first off we want to take care when

18
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,280
we're looking at tire alignment

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
with a car and how that's going to

20
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,320
impact the wear patterns of the tire

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
so something called camber toe and

22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,960
caster

23
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,479
so camber is referring to the inward and

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
outward tilt of the tires

25
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,078
as viewed from the front you have

26
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,959
something called toe and this is from

27
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,200
the side

28
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,878
to side difference of the tire this is

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,679
the front and the back is it toe in or

30
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,119
toe out

31
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,719
there's something called caster which is

32
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,759
the slope of the steering axis and

33
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,800
that's kind of like you think of a

34
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,198
caster

35
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,839
on a shopping cart you can notice that

36
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:01,599
there's

37
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,199
negative cast if it's forward or

38
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,599
positive caster there

39
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,319
so tire alignment can also play into the

40
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,118
wear

41
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,839
as well looking specifically about the

42
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,599
camber

43
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
this is the inward and outward tilt of

44
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,679
the tire so it viewed from the front

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,280
this is that inward and outward tilt

46
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
uh inward tilt is considered negative

47
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,040
and outward is considered positive so we

48
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
look kind of at the car right here

49
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
we can see it has negative camber and it

50
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,478
has a lot of

51
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,839
negative camber this is used to

52
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,000
distribute the load across

53
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
the entire tread not so much in this

54
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
case improper camera can make the tire

55
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
aware on one edge

56
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
as probably indicated here and cause the

57
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,359
vehicle to pull

58
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,959
to the side that has the most positive

59
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,560
on camera

60
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,319
there's something called toe this is

61
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,799
referring to toe in and toe out

62
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,639
this is the side to side difference in

63
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
distance between the front

64
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
and rear of the front tires so if the

65
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,599
distance is closer at the front it's

66
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
called toe in

67
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,118
so we see indicated here on this race

68
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
car we tow in

69
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,040
and then the difference is closer the

70
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,759
rear this would be called toe out and

71
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
again this can also impact the wear

72
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,359
last we have caster here as far as

73
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,679
orientation of the tire

74
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,280
the caster is the fourth is the four or

75
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,560
f slope of the steering axis that's

76
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,199
referring to whether it's a negative

77
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
caster

78
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,039
or a positive caster a neutral caster

79
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,199
would be

80
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,318
it straight up and down the an example

81
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,719
here would be the

82
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,079
shock assembly positive casters when the

83
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,840
bottom of the steering axis

84
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
is in front of the tires contact path

85
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,479
negative is of course the opposite

86
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
so factory alignment specs for basically

87
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,598
all vehicles call for a certain degree

88
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,958
of positive caster

89
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,399
because this will help ensure good

90
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,439
stability and help maintain straight

91
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
head direction

92
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,680
with the promotion of steering wheel

93
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,439
self-centering

94
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
so this helps that wheel kind of

95
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,280
naturally want to track

96
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,519
in a straight line which is very helpful

97
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
for handling purposes

98
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,879
so when we're looking at our tires and

99
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
we're trying to estimate the

100
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,239
tread and where it may have worn or how

101
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,719
much it is worn

102
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,158
we can use a penny or a quarter using

103
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,000
currency to estimate the tread

104
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,199
simply using this penny in our quarter

105
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,598
the depth of the tread can

106
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,958
be closely examined and kind of looks at

107
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,959
the difference between

108
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,080
when you put the penny down how does it

109
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,280
match up to the

110
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,560
head of the in the person printed on the

111
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
currency there so for example looking at

112
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,598
the

113
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
difference between when push it down and

114
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,518
two

115
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,039
30 seconds tread is legally worn in this

116
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
case so we're looking here it's just

117
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,598
basically touching the head of abraham

118
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,280
lincoln

119
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,439
we flip that same penny around here and

120
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,878
look at six 30 seconds tread

121
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,359
well that's going to match pretty much

122
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,959
the base stairs there of

123
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,280
the lincoln monument

124
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
proper tire inflation so when we're

125
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,878
looking at properly inflated we're going

126
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
to have maximum amount of contact

127
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,798
under inflated only the edges are going

128
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,919
to be coming in contact and over

129
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,040
inflated you're just going to have that

130
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,079
middle crazy that little kind of like

131
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,598
that little bit of a balloon

132
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
effect so you want to refer the

133
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,598
vehicle's ornamental to owner's

134
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,359
manual to make sure that you have the

135
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,598
correct amount of tire inflation

136
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920
that's located on the door frame this

137
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,280
can also be checked on a suspect's car

138
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,559
if you take the tire pressure and

139
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
compare it to the door frame you can

140
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,799
have an indication of whether it was

141
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,680
properly

142
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,680
overly or under inflated old amount of

143
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
cars prior to 2003 might be inside the

144
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,879
glove

145
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,399
box fuel filter flap trunk lid there's

146
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,120
different locations it could be

147
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,519
most are typically found on the door

148
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
jamb

149
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,959
area do not use the pressure indicated

150
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
or molded into the tire sidewall

151
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,680
this indicates the pressure needed to

152
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,478
meet the tire's fully rated load

153
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
capacity

154
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,478
not necessary specifically what was

155
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
matched for

156
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,800
the vehicle itself so under an

157
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,759
overinflated if you get this little

158
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
weird kind of

159
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,960
symbol that shows up on the dashboard

160
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,360
that's an indication of

161
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,799
typically low tire inflation and

162
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
underinflated tires

163
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,079
have a higher rolling resistance which

164
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,240
reduces fuel economy

165
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,599
and they wear more rapidly so that under

166
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,879
inflate is going to have this kind of

167
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
wear pattern here there's going to be a

168
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,360
lot more wear on the outside side walls

169
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,199
than in the center however if you over

170
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,479
inflate a tire the opposite occurs over

171
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,680
inflation would have more wear in the

172
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,319
middle because you kind of get that

173
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,519
little

174
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,879
balloon like effect there so this is why

175
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,079
it's important to have proper

176
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,399
inflation because you don't want to have

177
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,000
these uneven wear patterns however in a

178
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,758
crime scene they can help you identify

179
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,120
or match up a potential tire

180
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,800
to a suspect's vehicle this just again

181
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,439
shows some more comparisons

182
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
of all the different types of under and

183
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,079
inflation

184
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,079
methods and over-inflation methods and

185
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,839
different patchwares and cup wears

186
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,000
just to give you some kind of model

187
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,758
examples in comparisons because

188
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,279
initially they may look very similar

189
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,600
if you look at them closely you'll be

190
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,079
able to determine the differences

191
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
and hopefully identify these individual

192
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,599
and unique wear patterns
