1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,109
looking at this image here we can see

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,819
this is a flower room we're gonna go

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,919
over some of the suggestions for

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,169
lighting a flower room even though this

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,689
one uses a lot of high pressure sodium

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,548
lights so the flower room is where the

7
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,169
maximum power rating is needed for your

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,269
plants that's where it's definitely

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,770
worth getting a par meter and comparing

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,589
to make sure you are supplying your

11
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,730
plants with adequate amounts they will

12
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,410
need to they will be under the most

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,390
stress so maximizing cannabinoid

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,060
production is an important part of the

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,528
flower room setting them up well while

16
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,170
in the vegetative stage in particular

17
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,630
will make this stage easier I call it if

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,429
the plants come in poorly and poor

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,710
structure and stressed it's gonna make

20
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,689
the flower rooms job a lot harder they

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,500
come in a lot healthier and well and

22
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,140
robust

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,549
then that prepares them well for the

24
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,770
flowering stage because this is where

25
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,500
typically the most stress the plants

26
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,149
will be under so high pressure sodium

27
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,619
lights I considered the current standard

28
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,329
light to use we could see a lot while

29
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,308
they are off in this image you can see

30
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,859
how many are hanging above the plants

31
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,750
here all the all in one Dallas Dallas

32
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,329
reflector in bulb setup is preferred

33
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,978
versus one that is separate I could see

34
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,978
that we do have the ballasts to reflect

35
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,719
during the bulb all in one unit here

36
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:15,150
keep in mind that the our life of the

37
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,099
bulb for high pressure sodium is 5000

38
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,630
it's about eight thousand hours maximum

39
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,009
so that's something to take in

40
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,839
consideration if you're going through

41
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,950
and lighting a flower room with that to

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,420
keep in mind the hours so you're

43
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,978
treating those bulbs out before they

44
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,618
really wear out and cut down on your

45
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,150
overall potential for harvest the

46
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,938
reflectors should also be changed out

47
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,130
about every other year because you want

48
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,169
to maximize the amount of light getting

49
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,699
to your plants so it could be the bulbs

50
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,070
most grow changing those out about every

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,859
year or a little less and changing

52
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,728
reflectors out about every other year we

53
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,959
could see the high pressure sodium

54
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,879
lights keep in mind will produce that

55
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,709
kind of yellowish orange is kind of

56
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,379
tones here they said they are in this

57
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,629
image but the lights are off cement

58
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,280
metal halides are light emitting plasmas

59
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,109
the light in these new classes are being

60
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,689
phased out in general Streck mental

61
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,188
highlights see mh's provide spectrum

62
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,319
that's not present in the high pressure

63
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:07,199
sodium but there's a lack in total

64
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,628
output however in some cases both

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,250
generally favoring the experimental

66
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,959
halides are being used in addition to

67
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,740
high pressure sodium lights to increase

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,719
the spectrum

69
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,090
plants are receiving so in this image we

70
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,669
can see the vast majority of the light

71
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,670
and a spillover on the walls here is

72
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:26,309
high-pressure sodium but see MH s this

73
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:28,139
is the CMH here I see this image here

74
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,180
are being used in between the

75
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:32,069
high-pressure sodium in this case we're

76
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,500
kind of maximizing the plant spectrum

77
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,259
the spectrum of light that the plants

78
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,090
are going to be receiving le peas could

79
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,519
also serve this purpose but typically

80
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,229
due to cost and the fact that they're

81
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,150
not really being used as much anymore

82
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,729
this French metal halides are being used

83
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,409
in for veg and some growers are

84
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,899
transitioning with the same structures

85
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,579
as part of their flower room to help

86
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,370
increase the spectrum those plants are

87
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,260
getting elastin we have LEDs and

88
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,789
full-spectrum LEDs are progressing and

89
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,739
will likely be the preferred light going

90
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:04,079
forward many benefits of the full

91
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,750
spectrum in addition to having low power

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,910
consumption a low profile and reduced

93
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,979
heat generation however some of these

94
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,240
are really cost prohibitive so while

95
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,399
there may be the best option from the

96
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,600
plant standpoint from the growers

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,539
standpoint it might not be

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,859
cost-effective currently so for

99
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,719
flowering you don't always have to be

100
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,580
growing under high pressure sodium there

101
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,050
are some other options and even some of

102
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,910
those lights that may be used for the

103
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,010
vegetative stage it can kind of be

104
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,960
carried over for the flowering to give

105
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,939
them that fuller spectrum to hopefully

106
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,390
maximize terpene and cannabinoid

107
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,389
production
