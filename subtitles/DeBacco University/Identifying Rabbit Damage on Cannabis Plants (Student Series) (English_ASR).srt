1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
when trying to grow any plant material

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,878
there's always pests to consider

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,638
in this debaco university student series

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,518
video we're going to look at identifying

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,119
rabbit damage on cannabis plants and

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,280
we're going to see kind of the damage

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,038
that they can do as well at the end i'm

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,358
going to suggest on how to properly

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,039
install a fence to reduce the chance of

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,039
this problem happening to you

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,558
[Music]

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,439
so this plant has just suffered some

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,759
physical not biological damage you could

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,320
tell this because the rest of the plant

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,399
doesn't really seem to have this issue

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,558
it's just localized right here towards

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,359
the bottom of the plant it also doesn't

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,039
really affect how each of the leaves

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,600
come out how their color is and

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,160
everything like that this is actually

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,558
physical damage that comes from being

22
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,000
nod by a bunny now you usually wouldn't

23
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,479
think that bunnies would be an issue

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
when it comes to growing cannabis but as

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,239
you can see here one decided to come up

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,640
to this plant and gnaw just the outside

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,478
causing this physical damage

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
this is localized to the bottom of the

29
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,280
plant because of their size and height

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,079
pretty much but

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,239
they do come and will eat your plant so

32
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,000
unless you have proper fencing up you

33
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,839
have animal issues to worry about

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
and this shows the proper way to install

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,799
the fence to prevent the rabbits from

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,799
simply digging underneath
