1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,278
this debaco university video is going to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,519
go over some analytical report testing

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,638
regarding cannabis plant material here

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,839
are some of the things you might be

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,119
familiar with if you've seen an

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,798
analytical report

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,239
and if not i'm going to break each of

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,000
those down with a quick summary

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,679
and it'll be other videos that go into

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,679
each of these in more detail

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,160
[Music]

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,920
all right let's get into analytical

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,879
report testing for cannabis plant

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,880
material

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,320
so first off the importance of cannabis

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,840
testing in general

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
it's been legalized in many different

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,480
numbers of countries around the world

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,840
however the there is some variability

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,959
within possession distribution and

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,039
cultivation

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,079
it's a big market and it's consumed in

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,640
multiple ways

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,239
and because it's uh can be ignited

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
through smoking

26
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,599
it falls into different categories of as

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,759
far as

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
volatilization of certain compounds and

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,358
this is why

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
knowing that testing of the cannabis is

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,039
very important

32
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,000
it's important for the safety of the

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,478
consumers

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,599
and it's something that all consumers of

35
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,079
any of these products

36
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,359
should be requesting for any purchased

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,719
cannabis plant material that they're

38
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,200
looking at

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,920
so why is testing needed let's mention

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
before

41
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
the legalization of canvas for medical

42
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,559
and adult use has led to the development

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
of widespread production

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
of cannabis and related products much as

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,840
we saw listed

46
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,199
in the previous slide however with this

47
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,359
increase in prevalence

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
there also needs to be testing of those

49
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,920
products to ensure

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,960
ensure customer safety just because it's

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
a plant

52
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,158
there's a lot of things going on that we

53
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,158
can't visually determine we need to have

54
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,200
proper testing done on that cannabis

55
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,079
plant material so again general cautions

56
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
with cannabis just in general it is

57
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,478
important

58
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,560
to get cannabis tested which i know a

59
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,478
lot of growers think that oh yeah

60
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
it's a plant it's okay it's going to be

61
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,280
fine it is important

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,040
it's screened for more than just the

63
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,359
cannabinoids and terpenes

64
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
that a lot of growers are looking for

65
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,679
those are typical growers are most

66
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,158
interested in

67
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
but there's also clean cannabis is very

68
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,960
important and some

69
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,239
something consumers should be looking

70
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,000
for and requesting if they're not

71
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
provided with this information

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,919
what information are we looking at we're

73
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,440
looking at mycotoxins

74
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,799
pathogens pesticide testing because the

75
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,239
cannabis plate material might look

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
perfectly fine visually

77
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
but may contain some of these which can

78
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,160
have very negative

79
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,840
impacts mycotoxins can also be potential

80
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,439
carcinogens as well so

81
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,439
that's important to consider pesticides

82
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,800
again when ignited they could cause some

83
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,120
potential negative

84
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
effects and additive exponential

85
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
negative effects

86
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
so again all of these are of concern

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,439
there's not one that's more of concern

88
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,119
than another

89
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,439
all these should be tested for and

90
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,039
provided with a result for

91
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,719
for any cannabis plant material you're

92
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,639
looking at purchasing

93
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,919
now what does an analytical report look

94
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,518
like this is just one

95
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,839
example here and there's many different

96
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
companies but this just gives you a good

97
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
example of one all products that someone

98
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
is considering consuming should have a

99
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,799
supporting

100
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,518
analytical report to help ensure product

101
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
safety

102
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,439
it goes over microbials heavy metals

103
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,360
mycotoxin pesticides

104
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,359
as well as the terpenes and cannabinoids

105
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
that most consumers are interested in

106
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
we're looking at lab id we're looking at

107
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
timing

108
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,039
dating i should say as far as knowing

109
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,318
when that lot was harvested

110
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,400
knowing that when that report was

111
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,039
generated by whom it was generated

112
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
to who it was reported to so on and so

113
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,239
forth and signed off and reviewed on

114
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,039
all important information so categories

115
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,120
provided in

116
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,798
analytical reports again the microbial

117
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
analysis heavy metals mycotoxins

118
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,519
pesticide testing terpene analysis and

119
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,598
cannabinoids

120
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,719
will be briefly covered in this video

121
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,798
and there'll be other videos that go

122
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,479
into each of these in more detail

123
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,040
now a lot of times we see these listed

124
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,959
on a label which is great to see

125
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,959
and it gives you that general summary

126
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,598
however you do also want to have the

127
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,759
backup

128
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,438
of the not only having it on the label

129
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,280
but making sure everything matches up

130
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,598
with to go back to the previous slide

131
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,199
with the actual official analytical

132
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,798
report as well

133
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,479
so it's great to see microbial

134
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
mycotoxins heavy metal chemical residues

135
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,798
pass

136
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
but you might want to go back and have

137
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,920
access to at least of that original

138
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,598
analytical report

139
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,039
from which these numbers were derived

140
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,279
from

141
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,879
now a research article here looking at

142
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,638
cannabis contaminant limits

143
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,159
we're looking at the pharmaceutical use

144
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,199
of cannabidiol

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,720
with here we're looking at

146
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,040
pharmaceuticals we're looking at that

147
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
lab grade pharmaceutical grade very very

148
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
high-end grade

149
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,240
end product that's why in part the

150
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
reason of the importance of these

151
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
particular testings

152
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,839
so the microbial analysis to begin with

153
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,759
well cannabis is associated with various

154
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,159
types of microbes including molds

155
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,879
that have shown harm to

156
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,560
immuno-compromised patients

157
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,240
as well as bacteria and viruses that

158
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,519
could have the potential for causing

159
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
harm to humans

160
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,879
so it's very important to get that

161
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,799
microbial test check that

162
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,560
to make sure quote nothing microbially

163
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
is growing within the cannabis you're

164
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,839
looking

165
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,039
at purchasing then we get into heavy

166
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,679
metal testing and this

167
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
cable cannabis plants have been shown to

168
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,959
hyper accumulate and incorporate these

169
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,319
heavy metals into tissues

170
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,120
throughout the plant and have been

171
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,759
previously explored for their ability

172
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,399
to bioremediate contaminated soils

173
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,319
typical

174
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,918
healthy metals tested for arsenic

175
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,199
cadmium lead and

176
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,159
mercury and mycotoxins as mentioned

177
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
earlier

178
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,000
alpha toxins and mycotoxins that become

179
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,560
especially problematic while drying and

180
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
curing

181
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,839
cannabis products in humid environments

182
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
so it may not be there during the

183
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,599
growing process but that during that

184
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,840
final

185
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,439
finishing process they could develop and

186
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,159
have very negative effect

187
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,600
effects for any potential consumers then

188
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,400
the pesticide testing

189
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,240
so while many claim cannabis is

190
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,079
naturally a pest resistant crop

191
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,519
there is still an abundant use of

192
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,800
various pesticides

193
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,120
to provide protection including

194
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,478
insecticides fungicides as well as plant

195
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
growth regulators

196
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,639
lack of regulation have led to

197
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,800
widespread use of hazardous pesticides

198
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,319
including a couple listed here micro

199
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,720
butanol being a very common one

200
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,720
as well as several others intended for

201
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
ornamental plants which are not approved

202
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,680
for human consumption

203
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,479
particularly the way cannabis plants

204
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
tend to be consumed some pesticides

205
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,560
soluble solids or extracts and

206
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,758
cannabinoids including cbd oils

207
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
in the sense that even going to

208
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,240
extraction they can be present in that

209
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,439
extraction because they're that

210
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
lipid solid soluble and that does cause

211
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,240
concerns

212
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,840
about contamination with pesticides and

213
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,519
the potential health risks

214
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,679
that would be a company concentrating

215
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,279
these pesticides in any final

216
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,879
extract that is produced now the terpene

217
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,638
analysis again as most

218
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,680
consumers are probably most interested

219
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
in is beneficial for patients as well as

220
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
breeders

221
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,918
this helps consumers identify the right

222
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,479
strain of their desired effect

223
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,079
breeders can also selectively modulate

224
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,478
the terpene ratios of their strain in

225
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,399
order to maximize desired benefits

226
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,079
that certain consumers might be looking

227
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,120
at purchasing

228
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,198
and there's also the the

229
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
looking at the thc and the cbd the

230
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
cannabinoids

231
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,599
in general as well as getting to some

232
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,680
more specifics of

233
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,439
cbda cbn cbg things like that can also

234
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,959
be tested and screened for

235
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,478
cannabis has been shown to potential

236
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,879
therapeutic effects and treatments of

237
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,560
pain

238
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,240
mood disorders and inflammatory

239
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,959
inflammatory diseases

240
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,879
since the concentration to potency of

241
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,719
cannabinoids in cannabis can fluctuate

242
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,639
through various stages of plant growth

243
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,880
and in different plant strains it is

244
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,360
imperative for patients that

245
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,240
canvas cultivars ensure cannabinoid

246
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,520
identity

247
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,639
as well as consistent purity as well as

248
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,560
concentration

249
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,240
the only way you're able to tell that is

250
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,240
again through this testing

251
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
process and making sure you're getting

252
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,598
that provided

253
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,280
analytical report a little bit more

254
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,878
detail than you may want to get into but

255
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,598
looking at some of the common cannabis

256
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,599
testing

257
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,279
methods this provides you with some of

258
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,959
the tests that are completed to generate

259
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,918
the numbers you see on an analytical

260
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,918
report

261
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,839
grower's viewpoint we look at the tests

262
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,279
here it's good to know what methods your

263
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,679
chosen lab uses

264
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,198
and from a consumer standpoint of uh

265
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,120
it's also good to know

266
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,478
the methods used to allow you to make

267
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,319
comparisons of these numbers

268
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,758
if you're testing or looking at

269
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,360
different labs

270
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
there may be different variability based

271
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,598
on the analytical equipment

272
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,038
used there might be different numbers

273
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,478
might be different ratios things to

274
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,120
consider and look at

275
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,318
so it's good to know what what lab the

276
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
test came from

277
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,520
what analytical methods they're using to

278
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
allow you to make those

279
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,718
fair comparisons between different labs

280
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,958
so you can ensure you are an informed

281
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,760
consumer any product you're looking at

282
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,759
consuming

283
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,038
from a grower's standpoint any numbers

284
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,319
you're getting back it's important to

285
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,679
know what tests were done

286
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,959
to make sure it's an accurate

287
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,958
representation of your final end product
