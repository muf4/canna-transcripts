1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
so in this video lecture I'm gonna cover

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,839
non-mendelian genetics what does that

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,349
mean these are two next don't follow

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,420
Gregor Mendel's theories and patterns

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,298
and laws the kind of a little special

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:18,059
case let's go over some of these

7
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:19,948
specialties so some traits don't show

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:23,579
Mendelian inheritance Oh what does that

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,800
mean they are following quote different

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:29,570
rules and then segregation of alleles

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,528
can be disguised by a variety of factors

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,480
here's a couple here I'm going to kind

13
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,789
of mention a few of them incomplete

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,128
dominance Co Down and sex-linked factors

15
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,839
environmental effects so there's a lot

16
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:42,420
of things they're gonna call cuz genes

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,600
not to be as simple as we saw with

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,090
Gregor Mendel in his pea plants so

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920
looking at the first one here incomplete

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,750
dominance so this is kind of a good one

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,370
to kind of go through and review neither

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,649
allele is completely dominant over the

23
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:58,769
other in this case we have a big R of

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,289
representing red petals and little R

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,570
representing white petals when we cross

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,280
these two together red isn't dumb it

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,290
over white whites that down over red we

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,960
get a blending the heterozygote

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,000
individuals the big R little ours have a

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,429
phenotype that's a blending of the two

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,700
alleles in this case pink so we have a

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,159
red with a white producing heterozygotes

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,780
would be pink that pinkish purple in

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,210
this case so this is just kind of

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,680
showing in complete dominance wasn't

36
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,750
done it over the other it's incomplete

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,700
you kind of get this blending causing

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,969
the heterozygotes to have their own look

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,460
or phenotype we also have something

40
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:38,609
called codominance so as this name

41
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:41,129
implies two equally dominant alleles are

42
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:43,049
expressed at the same time heterozygous

43
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:47,699
phenotype will of both phenotypes

44
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,618
visible so certain genes in example with

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,540
hemoglobin is made from a recessive

46
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:52,920
alleles it's a sickling genes of

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,590
sickle-cell anemia where we're getting

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,299
both the normal hemoglobin and the

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,430
sickle trait also being observed may be

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,799
something easier to kind of visually

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,920
picture with codominance is if we have a

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,868
white cow we have a brown cow if they're

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,848
exhibiting codominance we're getting a

54
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,460
white cow with brown spots essentially

55
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:16,129
getting that code diamond toric seeing

56
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,920
white and the brown unlike our previous

57
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:20,870
example here look at incomplete notes we

58
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,299
have a blending we don't have a blending

59
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,560
here we have an expression of both and

60
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,230
with the sickle cell trait we have these

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,960
sickle cell gene with also the normal

62
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:32,899
red blood cells so looking at that

63
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,180
sickle cell example here the normal gene

64
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,640
in sickle cell gene well in this case we

65
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,379
have two carriers we have a child that

66
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,379
does not have sickle cell name a tubing

67
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:44,150
normal copies this one does is a carrier

68
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,030
for sickle cell so it does have the gene

69
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,129
same with this offspring and sadly this

70
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,069
offspring has both copies of sickle cell

71
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:55,579
and probably will not survive the

72
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,870
intervention into reproductive age so

73
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,980
it's just an example of following the

74
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,900
genotype in inheritance this is a great

75
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:04,399
kind of combination picture of

76
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,980
codominance and incomplete dominance

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,469
here we have Co now as we have the red

78
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:12,349
and the white both being expressed

79
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,270
we have incomplete dominance over here

80
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:17,299
where we have kind of that red and white

81
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:19,520
blending together to make that pink so

82
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,860
be mindful of comparing and contrasting

83
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,200
the difference of codominance and

84
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,710
incomplete dominance both of which are

85
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,959
examples of non-mendelian genetics

86
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,250
so this polygenic inheritance so this is

87
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,980
very important when we're looking at

88
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,379
blood type for example so if we're

89
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,909
looking at blood type what can be

90
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,340
important we're looking at blood type is

91
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:43,490
that there is this polygenic genes that

92
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,219
exist so more than two alternate alleles

93
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:48,469
blood grouping is an example so in

94
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,270
this case we have possible alleles from

95
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:52,219
the female parent from mom we have a

96
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,430
blood type B blood type or in this case

97
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:57,830
this would be Oh blood type A and B can

98
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,020
be codominant they're expressed if

99
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,969
they're present and I is the recessive s

100
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,219
we call that Oh blood type so these are

101
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:06,710
the possible alleles from mom here's the

102
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:08,659
possible alleles from debt and a B or in

103
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,730
this case I which would be standing for

104
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,289
Oh blood type well we kind of cross

105
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:13,969
these together and we have slightly

106
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:16,069
different colorations here now making a

107
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,500
little easier to follow here we have an

108
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:21,279
A and AIDS to be a blood type a crossed

109
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,560
would be here because we're polygenic

110
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,189
we're having that a B blood type we're

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,620
having both being expressed in

112
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:31,560
case here we having a blood type because

113
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,870
ou doesn't really have a marker to it so

114
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,280
that I is representing that recessive

115
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,040
trait there so this would just be

116
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,769
considered a blood type same thing here

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,140
and a beep means a B blood type B and a

118
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:45,750
B means it's B blood type and the B and

119
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,849
the recessive I would just be B blood

120
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,189
type and here we see the same thing

121
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,110
follows through and the only way to get

122
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,899
true O blood type is to have both

123
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,830
recessive alleles present here so you

124
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,259
can hopefully see a little color

125
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,779
variants as well as kind of that kind of

126
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,879
mixture of the two and how if you have

127
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,619
that recessive that kind of non antigen

128
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,899
expression and you have that B blood

129
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,000
type that will be just be even if your B

130
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,120
and B or B and that kind of quote oh

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,680
you'd have B blood type this kind of

132
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,259
shows again those alleles gives you a

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,840
little picture here of a blood type and

134
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,730
B blood type and a and B you can see

135
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,529
both of those being expressed and that

136
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,250
oh group really has no antigens or

137
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:28,259
expression on that outer cell of the red

138
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,279
blood cell antibodies present so if you

139
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,469
have a blood type you're going to be

140
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,029
anti B that's a foreign antigen to you

141
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,400
and because you're going to have the a

142
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,500
antigen and throughout here it's

143
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,989
important that a B has no antibodies

144
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,509
because if they had anti a or B because

145
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,180
they expressed both of those on their

146
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,129
red blood cells it essentially be having

147
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,290
a reaction that would occur it's

148
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,850
important if you're donating blood or

149
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,290
receiving blood that you get one from

150
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,050
the similar or compatible group type so

151
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,240
alas I hear these polygenic inheritance

152
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,250
well as we I said it's not as simple as

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,699
we saw Gregor Mendel and his pea plants

154
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,990
this Polly genetic inheritance involves

155
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,430
multiple genes and a spectrum of results

156
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,050
example here I gave is skin color it's

157
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,300
also true for eye color height and a

158
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,650
whole host of other genes depends on

159
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,780
several different gene pairs at

160
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:20,069
different loci and tandem alleles for

161
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,649
dark skin they're in complete balance

162
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,930
for those for light first generation of

163
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:27,089
offspring each have 3 units of Darkness

164
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,220
and intermediate pigmentation can have

165
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:31,500
that regression to the mean here some

166
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,570
very light-skinned here and a very

167
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,389
dark-skinned here you can kind of see

168
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:38,038
how those gametes are coming together

169
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:38,550
because we have this f1 generation where

170
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,620
we have

171
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,449
someone that's weighed the kind of zero

172
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,370
end of the skin pigment color and

173
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,439
someone who's very dark at the other end

174
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,269
with first generations right in the

175
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,149
middle but then we could see that their

176
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,490
offspring can't have the whole kind of D

177
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:55,469
Emmett here the majority will fit in

178
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,210
that kind of that two to four skin color

179
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,180
type but you could see that there's a

180
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,889
potential for a six in a zero as well so

181
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,829
that second generation of offspring have

182
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,959
a wide variation in pigments because of

183
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:08,969
this kind of mixing of genes here

184
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,909
hopefully that provides a little bit of

185
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,890
a background here looking at genes and

186
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:18,170
looking at these genes that don't follow

187
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,169
Gregor Mendel's set laws
