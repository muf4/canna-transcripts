1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
have you considered adding manure tea to

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,160
your canvas plants

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,679
well this tobacco university video will

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
provide you with some information and

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:16,710
some data

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:19,920
to look at how applicable this may be

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,679
[Music]

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,519
let's get into using manure tea for

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,439
cannabis production

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,799
so first off here's the research article

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
and i would invite you to kind of go

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
through

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
find the article look at in more detail

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,120
because there's a lot presented here

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
i'm just going to provide you again with

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,519
a brief overview

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
so the study specifics as far as

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
overview of kind of what they went

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,279
through and looked at

20
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,039
they evaluated the individual and

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,879
combined effects of commercial synthetic

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,839
fertilizer humic acids

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
manure tea and bio inoculants such as

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,879
inorganic

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
organic and biological resources

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,320
respectively

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
on cannabis growth and physiological

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,359
parameters

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,038
and here's some pictures of plants from

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,479
their study

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,160
so what were the treatments and this

32
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,198
kind of is

33
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,158
shows some of the data table that they

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,158
provided

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
so one of the two biological fertilizers

36
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
was micro grow

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,239
which is a brazilian patented product

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,560
categorized as manure tea

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,920
so micro geo is this manure tea

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
specifically that was looked at in this

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,478
study

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
this bio fertilizer is composed of

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,438
organic components

44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
active in dormant cells from various

45
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,438
microorganisms

46
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,199
and metabolites and organomineral

47
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,359
chelates that are produced through

48
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
continuous anaerobic fermentation

49
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,359
in a liquid medium so when we're looking

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,799
at kind of what's presented here we can

51
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,200
kind of see some of the

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,720
sighting of sources as well we see that

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,759
bio fertilizer category which will be

54
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,679
focused on

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,399
the micro geo and micro uh geo supreme

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,240
bio inoculant and what is this here this

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,320
is a water soluble powder containing

58
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,000
several strains of bacteria and fungi

59
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,959
including 11 different mycorrhizal

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
species and microbial foods is well

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,000
included in the mix so you can kind of

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,640
follow these through

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560
the study now what are the effects of

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,879
these biological stimulants on

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,959
cannabis well the microgeoproducts did

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,799
increase you in root biomass as

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
this was generally not different from

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
the control

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
and this may have been due to the

70
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,159
reduced stress and not the overall

71
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,680
improvement of the plant it's an

72
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,799
important note to make there

73
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,200
however there is still change for

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
improved cbd content even though this

75
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,639
data was not

76
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
collected in the study so what this is

77
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,878
showing here is the different

78
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,919
groups and different treatments and the

79
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,878
shoot biomass

80
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,479
the root biomass and then the total and

81
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,359
keep in mind means within

82
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,679
a column followed by the same letter are

83
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,680
not significantly different at the 0.5

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
probability level of statistics

85
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,319
so you could pause the video here and

86
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,919
take a look at some more detail but

87
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,958
there's definitely some consistencies

88
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,958
here sadly

89
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
not showing a whole lot of differences

90
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
so what were the researchers general

91
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,719
conclusions

92
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,719
well their general conclusion was the

93
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,680
combination of the combined application

94
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,878
of humic acid

95
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,640
and bio fertilizer resulted in additive

96
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,878
but not synergistic increase in the

97
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,518
measured parameter what their core ideas

98
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,560
was that cannabis height chlorophyll and

99
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,319
photosynthesis were affected by vital

100
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,519
fertilizer and umic acid

101
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,958
can con cannabis biomass was rarely

102
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,360
affected by the application of

103
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,039
biofertilizer and or humic acid

104
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
now clear evidence found in the

105
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,560
additional benefits from the combination

106
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,199
of biofertilizer and humic acid

107
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,239
therefore bio stimulants may contribute

108
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,479
to cannabis stress

109
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,400
mitigation and naturally about it so

110
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,679
keep in mind if you are growing plants

111
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
and hopefully maintaining their

112
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,400
environment so there is not a lot of

113
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,239
stress on the plants

114
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
then the really effectiveness of adding

115
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,719
some of these biostimulants such as

116
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,039
manure teas

117
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,639
may be significantly reduced good if

118
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,039
they're in a stressful situation

119
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,000
but in this case or this study if you're

120
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,439
keeping the environment

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,439
well keeping the growing environment

122
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,039
very supportive the effectiveness of

123
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,759
these bio students may be greatly

124
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,919
reduced

125
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,039
to the point it's not worth the extra

126
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,119
labor

127
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,318
time and money to add them to your

128
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
growing operation
