1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,879
so in this video lecture looking at the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,560
13 major characteristics of

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,080
handwriting i stress major

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,320
characteristics you can get down to the

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,839
details as we see pictured here

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,919
but we're going to get kind of at the

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,439
broad and look at some examples

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,039
of the major characteristics in

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,160
handwriting also great to look at your

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,439
own handwriting

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
well the statement for comparison is

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
going to be jack and jill went up the

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,118
hill so we're going to keep this

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
consistent

15
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,198
through the samples we're going to look

16
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:30,399
at through these 13 different

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,679
kind of methods of comparison so these

18
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,119
kind of characteristics that we're going

19
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,640
to be looking at they're all listed here

20
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,320
i'm going to go through them

21
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,399
so hopefully you can stick along stick

22
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,520
around and pause the video it's

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
encouraged you can kind of

24
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,800
look and compare to see what you're

25
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,439
looking at for these

26
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,320
13 major characteristics we'll start

27
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,718
with the first one look at

28
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,238
line quality well the letters are the

29
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,120
letters erratic are they shaky or do

30
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,198
they flow

31
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,399
you can see an example of smooth shaky

32
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,599
or nervous or juvenile

33
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,600
and or or deliberate here so

34
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
these are just different line qualities

35
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
to be looking at

36
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,878
the degree of smoothness shakiness or

37
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,000
kind of deliberate writing

38
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,200
that the person may have done you also

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,438
have word and letter

40
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
spacing so what's the spacing of the

41
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,239
letters now

42
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,080
uh this example right near me we see

43
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,640
this kind of generated on a computer

44
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,719
form

45
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,719
but is the spacing between the letters

46
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,959
uh between the capital letters and the

47
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,319
smaller letters is there a consistent

48
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,399
pattern that we see that

49
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,639
space between capital letters space

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
between word formations what is that

51
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,040
spacing

52
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,640
again these are characteristics we're

53
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,000
looking at in someone's handwriting

54
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
sample

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
we also have letter comparison as well

56
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,359
as

57
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
size consistency how does the ratio of

58
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,640
height and width compare

59
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
are they consistent are they consistent

60
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,239
or are they inconsistent

61
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,159
how's the height of the overall writing

62
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,158
it's the height of the tall to the short

63
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
letters is there evidence of diminishing

64
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
strokes it kind of gets smaller as you

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,118
go through or as it increases you go

66
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,438
from left to right here all things again

67
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,879
to be

68
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,319
comparison and looking for consistencies

69
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,078
looking at someone's pen lifts is the

70
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,599
writing continuous or does the writer

71
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,438
lift the writing implement between

72
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,878
words not only between words but

73
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,598
sometimes between the different

74
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,719
letters you want to consider how often

75
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,719
are they picking that pen

76
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,400
up and moving it to the next letter or

77
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,239
word as we can see here

78
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,439
uh we can see this kind of joining

79
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
that's occurring here

80
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,479
between the letters of the same word but

81
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,878
there is a space

82
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,560
again between words some people will

83
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,759
break that kind of between the capital

84
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
letter and a lowercase letter there's

85
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,719
definitely a space there

86
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,759
there's a pen lift there as we would

87
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,919
call it then connecting strokes or

88
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,120
letters so our the capital layers

89
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,878
lowercase letters connected or

90
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
continuous or not as i mentioned before

91
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,840
we can see some of that

92
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,159
um also pay attention to how the first

93
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,000
letter starts and also how the last

94
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,759
letter ends is there a flare

95
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,199
is there a direct line at the end they

96
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,840
had a flourish it's called is your

97
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,799
abrupt

98
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,080
ending is there kind of this kind of

99
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
stroke kind of begin

100
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
to flourish to start the word um start

101
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,000
the letter i should say

102
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,439
so you're looking at kind of where are

103
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,318
their connections where are their

104
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,680
strokes in their letters beginning and

105
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,799
ending strokes leading to the

106
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
page placement so when we're looking at

107
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
where do the letters begin in relation

108
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
to the space

109
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,560
provided on a piece of paper now if

110
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,560
there's no lines that can

111
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
increase the variability that you may

112
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,158
see but where does the letter begin on

113
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,639
the page are they starting at the same

114
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,919
point

115
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,399
are they starting in the middle is

116
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,318
starting where are they starting how far

117
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,719
are they spacing it from the edge of the

118
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,199
paper that they're writing on

119
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,719
letter formation cursive and or printed

120
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,439
so are there any consistencies within

121
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,719
this

122
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,479
are the letters printed are they written

123
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,799
in cursive is there a combination of the

124
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,959
two

125
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
so often it can be seen how are the

126
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
letters oriented to these slants are the

127
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,840
angles are they

128
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
upright all again factors to be

129
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,039
considering

130
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
shading and also the pen pressure so we

131
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,798
can see this

132
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,039
large variability here as far as

133
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
is the pressure equal or unequal when

134
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,359
applied to the upward and downward

135
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,639
strokes

136
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
do you notice a pattern are there

137
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,598
consistencies are they putting more

138
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,719
pressure initially than

139
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,399
lighting up as they're going through

140
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,598
writing it's because is it the other way

141
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
around

142
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,399
again these are attention details that

143
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
will allow someone who's analyzing

144
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
handwriting

145
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
to be able to pick out some of these and

146
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,359
make comparisons or find similarities

147
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
that other people may not be able to

148
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,519
find or see

149
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,639
also the slant we talked about is there

150
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
a slant to the writing

151
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
in general you can use a protractor

152
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,199
music determine the degree if you want

153
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,519
to get to that level of

154
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
specificity but does it favor the left

155
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,959
or the right or is it variable

156
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
again consistencies within the writing

157
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,039
are important

158
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,959
baseline habits so how does the text

159
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,560
relate to the lines in the paper

160
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,079
it's written eyes above or below the

161
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,639
line are there consistent patterns are

162
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,359
they

163
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,720
very key about staying on the line and

164
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,040
having for example the p

165
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
drop below are they having some that

166
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
travel below they're having

167
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,758
some that drift above all these baseline

168
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
habits

169
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,439
are often consistent that you may see

170
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,319
flourishes or embellishes that i hinted

171
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,000
to before

172
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,759
are there additional curls or loops

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,319
added to the letters how fancy is the

174
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,319
writing

175
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,680
are there certain letters that this

176
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,159
handwriting has consistent

177
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,680
flourishes or embellishments on and

178
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
other letters that do not have that

179
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,360
again a pattern you might be able to

180
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,759
pick out and notice

181
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,600
placement of the crosses on the t's and

182
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,360
dots on the eyes

183
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
it's simple as it states here how are

184
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
the t's crossed are they in the

185
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,319
high or the middle or in the low portion

186
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,758
of the t

187
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,759
how are the dots of the eyes place are

188
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,000
they left right are they centered

189
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,080
um all things to be kind of considered

190
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
here we could see some extreme examples

191
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
here are they

192
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
kind of are the dots of the eyes a

193
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,680
little circle are they a true dot

194
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,160
where's that dot placed the dotting of

195
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,639
the eye

196
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,320
can be quite interesting when the dot is

197
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,079
precise it indicates order attention and

198
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,399
concentration by the author

199
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,240
an i without a da or a dot incorrectly

200
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,638
drawn indicates a lack of attention by

201
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,918
that

202
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,680
person or a kind of negligence by the

203
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,399
author were they in a rush

204
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
could that play into it as well in the

205
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,679
crossing of the ts

206
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,519
some of the characteristics there when

207
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
investigating the t how the two main

208
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,279
areas the stem and the t-bar

209
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,080
several characteristics compare the

210
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,918
shape of the stem angle of the stem

211
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,279
what's going on with where it's being

212
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,079
crossed where's that t

213
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,638
placed is it on a slant or not again

214
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,159
things to consider this t-bar

215
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
characteristics at least the

216
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
uh the height of that where is it placed

217
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
on that

218
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
what's the what's the progress of the

219
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,519
t-bar is it kind of

220
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,560
favoring a left or right side what are

221
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,399
the dimensions

222
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
of the tivo are the directions of the t

223
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,439
bar so as simple as

224
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,919
you know writing the word it i t two

225
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,319
l two letters can really tell a lot

226
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,799
about someone's handwriting potentially

227
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
lastly we have the margin formatting so

228
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
how much empty space

229
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,639
is left where does the writer leave the

230
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
empty space on the page

231
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,918
is it consistent is it jagged is there

232
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
an angle to it

233
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,598
these are things again to be looking at

234
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,479
as part of

235
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,199
all of the factors that go into

236
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,120
handwriting

237
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,800
analysis so as you can see it can be

238
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
quite varied but if you kind of break

239
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
these apart and

240
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,359
pick a handwriting kind of go through

241
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,360
all 13 you should be able to find

242
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
some of these unique characteristics and

243
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
if you look at your own handwriting

244
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,318
you might find things that you didn't

245
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,318
think you were doing all along
