1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
okay so when looking at setting up a

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,939
grow room well typically there's a lot

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,580
of electricity involved around lights

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,050
and fans and cooling and heating and

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,030
monitoring devices so you want to be

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,190
well-versed in the electricity basics

7
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,739
related to that supporting that grow

8
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:18,059
room so first off of our basics of

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,038
circuits will depend on the lights and

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,198
electrical equipment chosen they'll

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,810
impact the total capacity that that room

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,760
will need typically a 15 or 20 amp

13
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,239
electrical circuit will be necessary for

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,560
common household 120 volt systems keep

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,100
in mind if you're buying balancers

16
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,289
typically the 120 volt and also the 240

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,960
for buying a 240 system you want to make

18
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,820
sure that you have the appropriate

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,270
connections for that average household's

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,009
run on 120 you careful calculate your

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,920
power needs so no circuits should run

22
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,439
over 80% of the stated rating so let's

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,039
make it easy if it's a 10 amp circuit

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,659
80% of that would be 80 amps so a 20 amp

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,100
circuit would be running at no more than

26
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,288
60 answer whenever that a little bit of

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,520
a buffer factor there if it's a 20 amp

28
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,549
circuit you don't want to run all the

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,770
way to 20 amps there now know what your

30
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,439
electrical man draws in amps so it's a

31
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,030
system of measurement here look at the

32
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,589
labels lookit make sure your circuit

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,629
boxes can handle it if you're separating

34
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,430
everything out it's very easy to plug

35
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,469
things in but you've got to account for

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,210
what those draw for all the electrical

37
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,489
codes to know when it draws in amps add

38
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,618
these numbers up and determine the that

39
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,938
you're not overloading the circuit again

40
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,109
you keep adding something keep adding

41
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:28,379
one more thing one more thing one more

42
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,929
thing

43
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,890
very easy to overdraw any amps assume

44
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,049
everything's gonna be running at the

45
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,849
same time to create a worst-case

46
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,840
scenario sometimes you may say well my

47
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:38,640
lights are going to come off and then

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,390
this is going to come on then those are

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,519
going to go off and that's gonna

50
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,250
consider a worst case scenario just in

51
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,280
case everything does go on or is on you

52
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,409
don't want to run into issues they're

53
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,750
wanna be plugging into a GFI outlets

54
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,618
these are ground fault interrupter

55
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,930
certified outlets and these are

56
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,149
typically installed where humid high

57
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,280
humidity conditions where water

58
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,349
environment would be such as near a sink

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,090
this means each and its own built-in

60
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,890
breaker to cut power they're short and

61
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,868
they can be tested as little red that

62
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,610
here there is little buttons that you

63
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:10,409
can push to make sure they're functional

64
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,030
a little light here will indicate the

65
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,919
green light indicates it's on and

66
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,000
functional however you also

67
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,799
be able to note while these are

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,330
important should be able to have a

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,849
system to check these because they can

70
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,560
trip unexpectedly and so be sure to

71
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:24,689
check them so you don't suddenly lose

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,180
power to an outlet it should be this

73
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,159
typical three-pronged outlets component

74
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,409
so that you are also accounting for the

75
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,270
ground wire now typically to these

76
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,340
outlets who are plugging in extension

77
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,409
cords so running exchangers long

78
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,810
distance though is not as advised does

79
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,639
and also all extension cords are not

80
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,830
considered equal so we have a mess in

81
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,068
this little box here when purchasing

82
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,450
extension cords get the shortest that

83
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:51,268
you need to complete the job don't have

84
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:53,250
a bunch of coiled leftover extension

85
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,799
cords you also want to get the smallest

86
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,469
gauge or the thickest wire possible to

87
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,430
reduce resistance and chance of fire now

88
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,340
of course this is going to come out

89
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,080
increased cost but it is well worth it

90
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,530
so that gauge of wire this throws a lot

91
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,390
of people off the thicker the gauge and

92
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,180
as you can see here the thicker the

93
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,759
gauge the smaller the number so if

94
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,909
you're buying for example a comparing a

95
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,289
14 gauge wire to a 10 gauge wire well

96
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:23,159
that 10 gauge wire is going to be much

97
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:25,858
thicker than that 14 gauge a 21 get

98
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,389
really really thin here I'm 8 gauge to

99
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:29,579
be really thick so again it's kind of

100
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,069
sometimes it's counterintuitive or the

101
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,480
smaller the number the larger the gauge

102
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,939
and that will help reduce the chance of

103
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,858
fire reduce the heating and allow you to

104
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,539
be able to run longer distances if you

105
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,170
need to even though you want to try to

106
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,169
keep them to a minimum
