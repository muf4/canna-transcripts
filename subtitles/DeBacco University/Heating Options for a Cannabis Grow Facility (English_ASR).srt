1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
okay here on this debaco university

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,318
video i'm going to discuss heating

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,080
options for a cannabis grow facility

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,439
because many of the times lights do

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,599
produce heat but

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,718
in particularly northern climates we

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,880
need to be aware

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,039
of ways to heat that facility so that

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,839
we're maintaining a normal

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,210
plant growing in supportive environment

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:29,359
for our cannabis plants

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:30,640
[Music]

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
all right let's look into some heating

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,280
options for a cannabis grow facility

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
well keep in mind uh object or goal

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
number one

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,439
is to keep the plants happy chemist

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,239
plants typically prefer temperatures in

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,960
the 70s

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,078
fahrenheit 20 to 25 degrees celsius

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,239
which often means

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
if a grower is going to grow all year

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,119
heating system is usually a

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
necessity so this is why it's important

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,000
to look at and address

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
how you're going to heat your grow

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
facility so keep in mind that lights do

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
produce heat and that is a byproduct of

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,439
the lights

30
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,358
so the heat that delights should be

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,198
taken into consideration this may allow

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
you to downsize your heating operation

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,280
but a lot of times still

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,719
an external heat source is required you

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
also have to think about during the dark

36
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,118
period of lighting may need to help

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
maintain

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,879
warm conditions for the plants when

39
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,520
those lights are off and the flower

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,519
period

41
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,879
are going to be off for those 12 hours

42
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,839
so when we're looking at what heating

43
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,199
options there are

44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
these are the four main types that will

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
be covered in this video here looking at

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
electric heat

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
oil heat wood heat and propane so we'll

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
look at some of the advantages and

49
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
disadvantages of each here

50
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,000
so you can get a better understanding of

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,960
how they compare to one another

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,519
so starting first with electric heat the

53
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,438
advantage

54
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,959
is its instant basically comes right on

55
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,438
and immediately starts heating up

56
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,798
it offers very precise control you can

57
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,758
have a thermostat that really can

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
regulate

59
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
electric heat very precisely however the

60
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,118
disadvantages to electric heat that it

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
tends to be expensive

62
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,200
and can require circuit setups that

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
might be beyond the means

64
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
of what is normal for a facility you

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,118
might have to redo a lot of

66
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
electrical work which might cost time

67
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,718
may cause

68
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,000
money and might not be possible

69
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,799
depending on the area you're

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,439
located then there is oil heat and the

71
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,879
advantages

72
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,560
is that you can store it in large

73
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,799
quantities you can have tanks

74
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
it's very easy to get readily available

75
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,439
however the disadvantages

76
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,959
is that it does require maintenance and

77
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,318
you need to have a tank in a way and a

78
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,039
place to store that tank

79
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,839
safely so for you know oil heat there

80
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,400
are some pros

81
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,319
can have that reserve uh you know what

82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,319
you have as far as quantities go

83
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,318
but you do have to maintain the

84
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,238
equipment and have to have a place to

85
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,560
store that tank as well

86
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,239
then there's wood heat so the advantage

87
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,199
of heating a growth facility with wood

88
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,920
is it can be less

89
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,799
a less expensive form of heat it also

90
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,359
can be a very

91
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
reliable heat source the disadvantages

92
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
is that i call it it's a dirty heat and

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,800
there's a lot of certain ash that can

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
develop as a byproduct of burning wood

95
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
and sometimes it needs to be fed

96
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,359
manually in say for example of a wood

97
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,279
stove

98
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
so while that would may be easy to get

99
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,759
does require that manual

100
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,039
feeding process and there's a last type

101
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,079
that i do want to mention here and

102
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,560
that's propane

103
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
heat and this is one that has advantages

104
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,598
because it can

105
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,318
be used as a carbon monoxide enrichment

106
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,238
source

107
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,238
it's very clean in burning but the

108
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,959
disadvantage is that it's often

109
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,719
limited storage options can be expensive

110
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,158
especially when needed the most usually

111
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,639
high points of demand

112
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,439
can be difficult to get and or expensive

113
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,399
they get

114
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,919
so you want to be concerned the

115
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
advantage and disadvantages of each of

116
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,199
these heat sources

117
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,360
make a selection and look at the channel

118
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,000
here for more details on whatever heat

119
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,519
source

120
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,239
you're choosing to heat your grow

121
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
facility
