1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
all right in this debaco university

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,719
video we're gonna look at beneficial

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,960
insects regarding thrips in your

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,120
cannabis production there thrips can be

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,559
a common pest that's identified this

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,320
gives you an example what they look like

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,919
as well as the damage and this video

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
will give you an idea of the beneficial

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,600
insects you can use to help control

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
these pesky insects

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,800
[Music]

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,399
all right let's get into the video here

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
so first off this is based off a

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,640
research article so you're welcome to

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,640
follow this reference and citation for

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,439
more details into the materials and

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,520
methods utilized as part of the study

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,399
so first off insects can be a challenge

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,960
in general for greenhouse production and

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,120
and these can cause many losses

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,558
economically environmentally

22
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,079
so here

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,079
typically the reason why we're talking

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,520
about beneficial insects in this video

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,359
is synthetic chemicals have been the

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,760
go-to option but there's many

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,079
restrictions using these forms of

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,679
pesticides this is the driving forced

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,000
development of new environmentally

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,159
friendly and profitable pest methods for

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,118
pest control which will be discussed

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,719
here

33
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,879
so first off this was a greenhouse study

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,039
conducted at the agriculture university

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,280
of athens they had plants grown in two

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
different greenhouses both one with

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,079
treatment

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
which had the beneficial insects and one

39
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,400
that did not uh the cultivar used was

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,240
this myosis variety and this gives you

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,320
an idea of the greenhouse's

42
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,239
environmental conditions

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,599
now the release date for the beneficial

44
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,039
insects was three weeks after

45
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,640
transplantation

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,000
beneficial insects were released into

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,879
the treatment greenhouse in order to

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,118
assess the efficiency of the biological

49
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,879
pest and method of control

50
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,680
so thrips or the study here this kind of

51
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,798
gives you

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
exactly an image of what to look like on

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,280
a leaf

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,640
and this is going to be the main one

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,920
talked about here of course the study

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,718
looked at others but this will be the

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,879
main one talked about in this video

58
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,879
so first off basic uh

59
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,879
measures for management

60
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,959
included visual estimation of

61
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,640
infestation and recording of pest

62
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,478
species and populations and the

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
comparison of infestations between the

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
two greenhouses only the nymphs and

65
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,280
adults stages of pests were counted not

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
the egg stage if you had an idea what

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
other insects they looked at or what

68
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,318
these insects look like in comparison

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
this nice little visual kind of key

70
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,000
identification here

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,439
might be of help to you

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
now how were these pest populations

73
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,520
determined well it was the measurements

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
of the pest populations were taken in

75
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,439
the third fifth seventh and ninth week

76
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,799
the number of pests in this case thrips

77
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,039
was counted with a handheld digital

78
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,280
1600x microscope in order to quantify

79
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,799
the efficiency of the beneficial insects

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,479
the average pest populations were

81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
measured in 10 plants four leaves per

82
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,719
plant per greenhouse

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,599
so with any pests that we're trying to

84
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,519
deal with understanding the life cycle

85
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,280
is important so i welcome you to pause

86
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
the video here

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,680
to take a better look at exactly what

88
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,839
thrips are what their life cycle is and

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,599
how you would go about identifying them

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,560
however i want you to keep in mind that

91
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,639
thrips can also transmit viruses

92
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,719
so not only can they do physical damage

93
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,158
to your plants but they can also provide

94
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,598
a vector

95
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,519
for other

96
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,000
negative impacts to your plants in this

97
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
case viruses so controlling the thrips

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,479
will reduce the physical damage as well

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,759
as the chance at virus vectoring their

100
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,280
life cycle they can go through a series

101
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,759
of six stages in only about two and a

102
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,479
half to two to three and a half weeks at

103
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,239
68 to 85 degrees fahrenheit with insects

104
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,840
realize that temperature you should be

105
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,519
monitoring that and recording that

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,000
because that can impact the rate of

107
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,360
development of certain insects now for

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,680
identification the adults are very small

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,599
very slender as well and they can have

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
different colorations so keep that in

111
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,518
mind the larvae are actually wingless so

112
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,598
they're not going to travel very far

113
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,400
they tend to like very hidden portions

114
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,280
of the plant so again keep that in mind

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,560
now the beneficial insects here uh

116
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
first one that was discussed is

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
ambulance swarovski this is a predatory

118
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
mite that pierces the prey with their

119
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,438
sucking mouthwarts and sucks out the

120
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,158
contents there and again some more

121
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,239
information about that specific one here

122
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,679
some tips and ideas you're welcome to

123
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,239
take a look at but again there's a

124
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
temperature tolerance range uh so again

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,518
we don't want to go above or below that

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
for to allow for the maximum

127
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,079
effectiveness

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,360
then the other one uh shown here is um

129
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,519
arius and kind of a cool kind of picture

130
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
here its life cycle is completed in

131
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,000
about three weeks it has this very

132
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,800
darkened kind of blackened back would

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,959
you speak it's a fast-moving predator

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,879
small soft-bodied insects can also feed

135
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,239
on pollen in the absence of prey so you

136
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,759
could potentially sustain this

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
population within your greenhouse if

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,919
you're growing some flowering plants at

139
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
some pollen to keep their populations

140
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,839
going and help

141
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,919
them keep going so they can help you

142
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,319
with thrip control

143
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,560
now the exact method of thrip control

144
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,478
how do we apply these insects well they

145
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
can be used with slow release satchets

146
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,439
that we kind of see right here each

147
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,400
contained about 250 predatory mites of

148
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,680
the

149
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,439
swarsky one and then of the arias one

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,120
here this was applied by spreading

151
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,038
evenly through bottles measured in the

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
leaves and also using dye boxes which

153
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,038
are basically little boxes that would

154
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,240
hang on your plants

155
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,519
now the numbers over time because this

156
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,199
was a study so i want to provide you

157
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,079
with the actual numbers

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,720
right above me here you can see the

159
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,599
table and then here's the graph

160
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,639
on week nine it was low as only about

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
2.6 thrips per plant with the treated

162
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,199
those plants treated with beneficial

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,959
insects compared to over 40 thrips in

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,720
control plants that of course were not

165
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,399
treated and we can see the great

166
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,360
contrast here they both start around the

167
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,120
same the control definitely much higher

168
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,600
and significantly higher as well and

169
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,918
then they treated slowly decreasing over

170
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,680
time great sign that these beneficial

171
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,038
insects were helpful

172
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
now average number of pest populations

173
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,439
again it was measured in weeks and this

174
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,879
study did was conducted on other

175
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,038
populations so you're welcome to check

176
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,120
that out but this continuous reduction

177
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,038
in all pest populations was observed

178
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
through the experiment approaching zero

179
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,918
plant values as well so it's a great

180
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,560
sign that these might be very effective

181
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,159
in use in your growing operation

182
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
now again are they worth it beneficial

183
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,520
insects in general well in short yes

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,280
study results that the beneficial

185
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,198
insects could control pest populations

186
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,719
up to 100 percent pest management with

187
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,079
natural enemies is promising very

188
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,919
effective safe method for plant

189
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,599
production as well as applicator

190
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,120
protection as well

191
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
now if you are thinking about this and

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,280
hopefully you are keep in mind that

193
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,879
proper pest identification is important

194
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,038
since this will determine the exact

195
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,478
beneficial insect used and this does

196
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,478
require frequent scouting which you

197
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,038
should be doing timing and rate of

198
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,478
beneficial additions are important and

199
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,879
when you get down to knowing exactly

200
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,038
what insect researching those contacting

201
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,120
the supplier of the beneficial insects

202
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,279
they can all help you develop a plan

203
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,598
that will be effective at controlling

204
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,519
your pest populations while minimizing

205
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,240
any chance of negative overall

206
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,240
environmental impacts
