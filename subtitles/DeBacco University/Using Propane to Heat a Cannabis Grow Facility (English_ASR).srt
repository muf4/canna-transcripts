1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,839
all right here on debaco university i'm

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,240
going to go over using propane

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,759
to heat a cannabis grow facility and

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,480
while we see the propane burners here on

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,000
the stove

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,920
we'd have a little bit more efficient to

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,920
heat our growing area for our plants

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,480
[Music]

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,320
all right let's go over some of the

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
details with using propane to heat our

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,518
grow facility

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
well first off when we're talking

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,959
propane or in natural gas heaters just

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,558
in general

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,039
they're certified for residential

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,640
agriculture as well as industrial use

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,799
they have quiet operation from

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,439
relatively small lightweight units

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,439
their power exhaust options can be used

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,359
in small diameter vent pipe

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,960
they are optional right or left hand

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,719
piping for installation

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
can be installed easily due to flexible

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,439
positioning of the piping

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
and they're sealed permanently

26
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,479
lubricated motor for trouble-free

27
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,920
dependability

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,679
and some models come with a 10-year

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
warranty on the heat exchanger

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,238
so all of these are very positive

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,719
aspects for a reason why propane or

32
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,920
natural gas heating for a grow facility

33
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,280
is a very common practice and as you

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
said agricultural

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
residential even industrial use so this

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
applies more

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,519
than to just the agricultural aspect of

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,879
things

39
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,199
now propane is similar to natural gas

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,640
but typically a little more costly so

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,840
again we sometimes use them

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,599
interchangeably terms

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
we want to be kind of mindful of exactly

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,239
which one we're going to be using for

45
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,158
our facility

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,000
it's typically easier to access though

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
than natural gas depending on where

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,879
your geographic location may be propane

49
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,280
offers minimal maintenance but a storage

50
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,920
tank

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,879
and pre-heater are required propane is

52
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,879
best purchased

53
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,078
by the transport load which requires

54
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,399
about a 30 30

55
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,559
000 gallon tank and that's usually

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
buried depending on your regulations

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
but usually it's buried purchase can be

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,359
made during a time of the year when

59
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,359
prices are the lowest

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,759
that'd be the most advantageous to the

61
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,478
person looking at making that purchase

62
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,040
to be very cost effective

63
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,078
now natural gas is one of the most

64
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
economical fuels

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,239
that's not available to growers in all

66
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,679
areas so just keep that in mind that

67
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
you have to check to see of its

68
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,439
availability particularly in

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,400
your area or your particularly growing

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,680
area

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,439
there to see if it is possible to get

72
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
no on-site storage is required since

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,239
it's piped in from trim transmission

74
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,400
line so this is one of the

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,360
why reasons why is limited on its

76
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
availability

77
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
simply because is it kind of sitting at

78
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
the street is it below ground that you

79
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
can

80
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,000
tap into or is it something that is just

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,759
not existent in your area

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
natural gas burns cleanly requires

83
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,518
little equipment maintenance

84
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,878
and used for central boilers or remote

85
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,879
unit heaters

86
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,399
this should not be the only heat source

87
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,598
for dedicated growing spaces because

88
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
some suppliers include

89
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,199
a interpretable claws interruptable

90
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,199
claws which

91
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,679
allows them basically to turn off your

92
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,359
supply in time of extreme need

93
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
usually during cold spells when the fuel

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,879
is needed to heat homes

95
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,959
as a backup fuel supply and equipment to

96
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,598
burn it are essential under these

97
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,598
conditions

98
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,759
just because your agricultural area

99
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,598
heating up a growth facility you're not

100
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,359
necessarily high in the list

101
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,079
and you want to look to see if there is

102
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,920
that interruptible clause where

103
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,920
if the demand is very high and the

104
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,238
supply is low they can actually

105
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,000
with their claws turn off the natural

106
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,239
gas flow to your facility

107
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
for larger users it's best to buy a

108
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
direct purchase

109
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,879
from one of the large suppliers near a

110
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,318
well head

111
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,639
adding the transmission cost to the

112
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,079
pipelines will give you a total fuel

113
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,119
cost it's important to take into

114
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,159
consideration

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,799
the total fuel cost there so again

116
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,079
not every heat source is ideal this one

117
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
is a

118
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
great and worth consideration if it is

119
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,598
an option in your area

120
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,518
but again consider all the pros and cons

121
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,238
with any heat source that you plan on

122
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,239
using
