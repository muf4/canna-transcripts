1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
okay here we're look at some of the

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,099
basics of nutrient management for squash

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,289
and it can be whether you're managing

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,779
organic nutrients or chemical

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,990
fertilizers we want to start with a soil

6
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,968
test and to our Mendes our soils so that

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,789
we are in the optimum conditions to

8
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:20,160
start with now nutrient deficiencies in

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,020
squash we have nitrogen what I look for

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,550
is yellowing of older leaves done to

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,649
divine growth and overall this kind of

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,179
limey green color you want to fertilize

13
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,608
with nitrogen-based fertilizer

14
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,500
especially early in the season when the

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,109
soil is cold didn't have a chance to

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,759
warm up quite yet continue regular but

17
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,350
small doses and nitrogen fertilizer

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,780
until we get to kind of fruit set

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,579
anything back off the picture I want to

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,770
show you here that I've taken of a field

21
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,660
really shows nitrogen deficiencies and

22
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,420
how they can change you can see the

23
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:51,479
plants in the back here are stunted in

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,030
yellow compared to the ones here this is

25
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,640
a very small area two three four or five

26
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,320
only about six seven plants long and we

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,620
could see that the nitrogen shifts

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,420
between here here particular knowing the

29
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,030
background of this field personally this

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
was a wetter area and as a result this

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,290
leached out more of the nitrogen and

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,450
this held more than nitrogen so it can

33
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,030
be even in this small plot of an area

34
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,890
you can have different requirements for

35
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,969
nitrogen so just something to keep in

36
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,710
mind there potassium deficiencies this

37
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,840
is leaf browning typically at the

38
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,509
margins which typically coincide with

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,150
fruit set or occurs shortly after fruits

40
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,709
begins to swell how to prevent this well

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,990
if you're known to be low in this you

42
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,179
can by adding you start adding some

43
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,618
potassium what about the flowers start

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,500
to open so you don't get into this

45
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,930
deficiency standpoint if caught early

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,180
can be corrected if it's caught late

47
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,280
yields may suffer high potassium

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,590
fertilizer like potassium sulfate is

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,210
recommended and we see that here at I

50
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,100
spotted here in this field this the

51
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,989
Martins are starting to burn this was

52
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:58,019
late in the season so not a major issue

53
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:00,989
but assign that this field in future is

54
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,429
probably low in potassium and we have

55
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,890
the low inside we also have the high

56
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,560
inside high nitrogen improves plant

57
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,378
growth but can actually impact and

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,479
reduced yield watch folio applications

59
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,829
as large and thin leaves of squash can

60
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,629
burn very easily

61
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,060
they can also get thin and crack they

62
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,740
can get this really aged look that's

63
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,620
picture of me here with some really tall

64
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,590
leaves here here's a typical gardeners

65
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,360
globe giant leaf this is all indication

66
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,879
of excessive nutrients which we want to

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,220
avoid because not only wasting the time

68
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,930
and the money of applying them also

69
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,560
could be contributing to soil

70
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,560
contaminants
