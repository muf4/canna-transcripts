1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
ever wonder just how water travels

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,599
through a soil profile

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,400
here on debaco university we're going to

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:11,279
see some cutaways of some soil profiles

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,798
and see just how water travels through a

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:17,919
soil profile

7
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,920
giving some varying different conditions

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,399
[Music]

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
all right let's get into how water

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,399
travels through a soil profile

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,880
well first off special thanks to this

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,839
video here that is uh provided

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,399
information because this is the video

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
where i

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,079
captured many of the screenshots that

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,359
we're going to see here presented so if

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,000
you want to look at the original

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,679
by all means look at the reference below

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
and look at the direct link there as

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,159
well

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,759
so getting into how water travels

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,679
through the soil profile

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,960
keep in mind that water does travel in a

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,558
unique way through soil

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,799
that depends on the composition of that

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,799
soil and also the potential layers of

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,320
different soil types that may exist

28
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,558
we're going to see this in a couple

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,280
examples now looking at the soil profile

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,038
in general

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,478
a lot of times soil scientists will

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,478
refer to horizons

33
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,920
the o horizon means the organic or very

34
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,840
very top layer here

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,118
the a which is the surface layer b

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
subsoil

37
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,478
see we're getting down into that deeper

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,118
areas typically where roots do not

39
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,759
travel

40
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,478
and are down here which is the bedrock

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,239
so this is why

42
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,840
understanding the type of soil that a

43
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,158
grower has is important

44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,040
as it will influence how water it moves

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,359
through it

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
also do the different soil types this is

47
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,560
why what

48
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,400
may work for one grower may not say work

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
for another when it comes to irrigation

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
frequency

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
and also duration so keep that in mind a

52
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,118
lot of it has to do

53
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,879
which is how water travels which a lot

54
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,319
of growers really don't necessarily

55
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,839
understand

56
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,359
so first off we want to consider

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
capillary action

58
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,438
so what just is capillary action well

59
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,839
kind of it's shown here

60
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,679
in this kind of example that we're

61
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
saying capillary action basically is the

62
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,439
ability for a liquid

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
to flow in narrow spaces without the

64
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
assistance of

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,879
or even in opposition to external forces

66
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,039
such as gravity

67
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,319
it occurs because of the intermolecular

68
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,959
forces between the liquid

69
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,239
and surrounding solid surfaces so what

70
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,039
we're looking at here

71
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
is we see kind of a see a glove we see

72
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,840
kind of a clear looks like a

73
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
piece of glass and we see this kind of

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,159
blue liquid here well what's happening

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
is down at the bottom there is a blue

76
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,000
liquid and there's actually two pieces

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
of glass and what the person is doing

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,878
here is they're pinching those two

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,239
pieces of glass together

80
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,280
as they make those two pieces of glass

81
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,719
tighter they're going through and

82
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,719
pushing those closer

83
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,560
they're reducing the space and that

84
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,000
creating a very small space you see

85
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
pushing here

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,878
causing that water to flow against

87
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,439
gravity pushing it in tighter making

88
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,639
that space

89
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,000
even smaller there allows that water to

90
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,079
travel even further

91
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,598
if the space is sufficiently small then

92
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
the combination of surface tension

93
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,799
caused by the cohesive properties of the

94
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,719
liquid in this case looking at water

95
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
and as adhesive forces between the

96
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,159
liquid and the container wall

97
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
act to propel the liquid that's exactly

98
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,280
see here that space gets smaller and

99
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
smaller crushing that together

100
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,878
increasing the height that that water

101
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,000
can travel because this smaller space

102
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,000
allows to water to

103
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
move further so that's what we're seeing

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
here in these images

105
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
now we also have the path of water in

106
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
soil so we're looking at just a

107
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,598
sandy loam alone and a clay loam and

108
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
basically we have large particles

109
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,878
medium-sized particles and smaller sized

110
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,079
particles at least in a relative

111
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,079
comparison

112
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,519
sandy looms will drain very quickly the

113
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
medium-sized loam is kind of that

114
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,719
medium-fast drainage and then clay alone

115
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,399
would be the slower drainage

116
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,158
and what we're looking at is those

117
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
cutaways are those profiles

118
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,359
now what we're seeing here is we see

119
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
little droppers and we're basically

120
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
simulating a rain event or maybe a drip

121
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,280
irrigation and this would go through in

122
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,518
drip

123
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
water at a very consistent rate well

124
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,760
what we're noticing is that the sandy

125
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
loam

126
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,318
over the standard set of time here fully

127
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,799
saturates by the end

128
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,798
the loam we see that slower and of

129
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
course the clay loom much more slower to

130
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,438
kind of

131
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,798
have that water percolate through what's

132
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,158
something we're also noticing in this

133
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,599
example as well as others

134
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,438
is that water does not travel in a

135
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,479
straight line water

136
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,878
actually slowly kind of cones outwards

137
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,079
from the original point where it hits

138
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,079
and comes in contact

139
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,840
with that surface this is why we're

140
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
looking at drip irrigation

141
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
we can have those drip irrigation lines

142
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
spaced further apart

143
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
and even though the very surface may

144
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,719
appear dry

145
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,600
what happens is the coning effect here

146
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
of the water

147
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
saturates the area or the root zone it's

148
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,560
a very important concept that a lot of

149
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,039
growers

150
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,879
forget about or don't fully understand

151
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,879
is that we're seeing this conan effect

152
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,918
of that water kind of cut it's here so

153
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,719
it's here it's right here and starts

154
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,279
coming out

155
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,080
and this is how we're able to saturate

156
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,559
these

157
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,240
root area the root zone with the

158
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
irrigation water and so we don't need

159
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,918
irrigation lines right next one

160
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,160
they can be spaced out and that distance

161
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,359
will depend on the exact soil type

162
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,639
because that's going to affect the

163
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,560
degree that that cone will go out

164
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,759
now here we're looking at an example

165
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
we're starting

166
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,879
up here so we're starting basically

167
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,399
right where i am

168
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,560
we have a deep sand layer and how does

169
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,478
that impact so in this case we have loam

170
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
we have a sand layer and we have loam

171
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,918
again so same soil type with a sand

172
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
barrier and then loam

173
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,038
what we're noticing is we're seeing that

174
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,799
same coning effect here saying that soil

175
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,719
starting to kind of go out

176
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,319
here it's just coming are initially in

177
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
contact with that sand layer

178
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,319
what we notice with that sand layer is

179
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
that it actually is a little bit of a

180
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,879
barrier

181
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,638
it prevents that water really from

182
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,038
percolating through as it normally would

183
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,000
we're seeing here spread out as well as

184
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,360
here again

185
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,519
and here we're seeing it definitely

186
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,080
continue to spread out but between the

187
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,478
two

188
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,918
images between me we're starting to see

189
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,560
a little bit of that saturation

190
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,240
penetrate that sand layer however once

191
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,918
it does penetrate that thin layers we

192
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
see the two images around me now

193
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
we are seeing the same coating effect

194
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,519
relocating below that area

195
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,120
but keep in mind that here that top

196
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,319
layer is fully saturated see that's

197
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,399
spreading out from that

198
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,439
a single point of entry spreading out

199
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,638
this full area

200
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,160
then it kind of breaks its way through

201
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,120
and that center point and then we're

202
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
seeing the coning effect

203
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
repeat itself again so it's very

204
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,000
important to understand now with soil

205
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,478
type you have this at the top

206
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,839
but if there's a a different layer there

207
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,560
if there's a barrier there if there's a

208
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,679
difference

209
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,399
type that occurs that can really impact

210
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
the way that this water percolates

211
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,318
through

212
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,680
the profile of the soil now lastly

213
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
in many fields they have to deal with

214
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,079
what's called a hard pan

215
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
this is considered the clay layers we

216
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,519
see here so we have low megan alone

217
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
again in this case instead of sand

218
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,198
now we have a clay layer it considers to

219
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,799
be like a hard pan this is commonly

220
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,240
found in tilled or plowed fields

221
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
where we have that equipment constantly

222
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
going over that certain depth and at

223
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,840
that bottom

224
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
where that scraping occurs we kind of

225
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,279
get a little bit of that hard layer

226
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,599
and we're seeing again that everything

227
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,758
starts out very similar in that lone as

228
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,000
we would expect it water's coming out

229
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,439
and then we have water kind of coming

230
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,439
out to the point that then comes in

231
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,240
contact with that clay or plow plant

232
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,399
layer

233
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,160
unlike with the sand layer while we do

234
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,519
see that the water is come in contact

235
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,319
and spreading outwards just so we stop

236
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,879
the sand

237
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,879
however even after a period of time we

238
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,680
really do not see the water penetrating

239
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,598
or percolating through that clay layer

240
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,879
so on a quick look of the profile of the

241
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,038
soil while this hard pan

242
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,879
or clay layer looks very similar to this

243
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,560
previous one we looked at with the sand

244
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,120
because the properties of sand are very

245
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,879
different the water is eventually able

246
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,680
to percolate through after a period of

247
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,240
time

248
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
however looking at a hard pan plow plan

249
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
layer or the

250
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,400
dense clay layer here as thin as it may

251
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,638
be

252
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,679
this example the water is unable to

253
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,400
penetrate that and that's going to

254
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
create a

255
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,879
pretty substantial dry pocket down here

256
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,598
so hopefully this allows you to better

257
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,680
understand

258
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,639
exactly how water percolates through

259
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,639
soil

260
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,319
regardless of the type and it's

261
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,960
important also to look at your soil

262
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
profile

263
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,399
to see if these any of these layers

264
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
though they may be thin exist

265
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,758
because that is going to impact how

266
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,918
water travels through

267
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,360
your soil profile this can be very

268
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,439
important for

269
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
spacing out drip irrigation lines

270
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,000
understanding this coning properties of

271
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,000
the water

272
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,079
is very important to ensure you're

273
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
delivering water to the root zone that

274
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,878
you want

275
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
without over irrigating or under

276
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,039
irrigating so you don't run the risk of

277
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,799
disease

278
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,800
or wasting water
