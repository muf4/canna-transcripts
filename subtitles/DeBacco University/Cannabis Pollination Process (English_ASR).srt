1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
okay I want to go over the pollination

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,359
process for cannabis even though this

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:09,750
may not be easy main goal for many

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,030
growers we're taking pollen produce my

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,789
male plants and pollinating a female

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:18,719
flower to produce seeds will be an

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:22,049
indication of a successful pollination

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,059
process so looking at our flower in

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,890
plants and that's well the broad

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,599
category that we're looking at and it

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,080
follows the same process as many other

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,789
flowers there must be a grain of pollen

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,969
that comes from the male flowers in the

14
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:38,369
stamen particularly the anther and it

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,689
must travel to the female pistol those

16
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,549
are the white structures we see on at

17
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,820
the cannabis plants from here it's gonna

18
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:47,218
travel down a pollen tube to reach the

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,899
ovule which is where the eggs are once

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,329
completed the pistol will turn a brown

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,129
color and a seed will begin to form so

22
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,439
you can see that kind of formation of a

23
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,808
seed here make an urge that over a years

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,329
our eggs and this is that formation of

25
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,729
seed will start to form as this even

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,739
mature x' the plant will degrade and

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,518
ultimately diet at the completion of a

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,530
life cycle

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,109
keep in mind cannabis is in annual plant

30
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,430
this process is sexual reproduction with

31
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,219
a combination of those plants

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,130
characteristics and the resulting seed

33
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,739
as we can see right here well the 50-50

34
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,780
chance of either being a male or a

35
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,250
female that's why it's important for

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,650
growing from seed need to be able to

37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,469
have a system in place early on to cull

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,118
out the male producing plant it see the

39
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,978
same image here where we see the stigma

40
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,900
we have see the pollen tubes the grains

41
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,900
going down and ultimately forming that

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,030
seed that will grow into a seedling now

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,290
female flowers unpalatable male flowers

44
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,570
and these are examples of unpiloted

45
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,969
female flowers or referred to as

46
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,309
sensimilla this will be the primary

47
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,950
location of cannabinoids and resins will

48
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,390
peak production six to ten weeks or so

49
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,969
after changing the photo period

50
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,310
depending on the cultivar used this is

51
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,890
is the calyx that will develop and swell

52
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,109
a the pollinated plants will result in

53
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,879
poor quality buds which is why it's

54
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,509
important to remove or isolate male

55
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,949
producing plants as early as possible

56
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,300
the goal is to increase cannabinoid

57
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,250
production have the plaintiff or alt

58
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,780
energy into producing the chemicals

59
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,490
instead of going through and producing

60
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,490
wanted seeds in many cases
