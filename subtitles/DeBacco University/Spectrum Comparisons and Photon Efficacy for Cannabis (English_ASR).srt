1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,359
going to go over spectrum comparisons

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,160
and photon efficacy for cannabis

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,839
production

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,359
so we're going to try to give you some

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,439
comparisons between

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,919
different spectrum produced by common

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,920
light sources

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
all right let's get into spectrum

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,800
comparisons and if we look just at the

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,800
title slide here

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
looking at our regular day dawn midday

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
and dusk we can see how

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,679
the overall wavelengths and intensities

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,920
can change

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,880
throughout just a single day but here

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,239
we're going to focus a little bit

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,559
something a little more consistent

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
indoor lighting so first off i have a

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,238
good reference article here if you're

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,600
interested in want some more information

22
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,119
definitely recommend you check this out

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
provided with some links and the proper

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,878
citations here

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,799
so you can go through and read the

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,039
details if you want for yourself

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,399
i'm going to provide a summary so we're

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,760
looking at photon

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,960
efficacy here note that photon efficacy

30
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,599
of hps lights is about 1.7 to allow you

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,799
for that

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,118
general comparison um here to the

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,960
numbers provided compare that to the red

34
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,159
led chips which are 2.6

35
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,639
times the efficiency so if we look our

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,118
led kind of red here at 4.5

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
and hbs lights are only about 1.7 for

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,759
that comparison

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,680
the conversion of efficiency of photons

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,640
efficacy depends on spectral

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,118
distribution

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,599
i want to be aware of exactly what

43
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,200
wavelengths are being produced by that

44
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,559
particular

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,400
light source so plant action spectrum

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
so plant action spectra associated with

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,079
the primary classes

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,520
of photosynthesis photosensitive

49
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,239
molecules in plants

50
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,000
action spectrum for the cryptochromes

51
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,438
are not yet well established

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,799
so just be aware we have chlorophyll a

53
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:51,758
and chlorophyll b i think most people

54
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,960
are probably familiar with at least

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,040
hearing those terms

56
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,478
and we could see here we can have a very

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
strong absorbance down

58
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,399
in that bluish kind of wavelength and

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
then another peak over here where we're

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
getting closer to that orange or red

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
areas there and these are measured in

62
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,959
wavelengths which we'll see in

63
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,478
future slides here on this presentation

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,598
so first off we're talking about light

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
in general i thought this picture was

66
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,079
kind of interesting just to show light

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
pollution on a soybean crop so if we're

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
looking at the kind of soybean field

69
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
here

70
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,238
we're seeing a roadway we're noticing

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,719
these like dark green kind of like

72
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,560
little

73
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,159
almost like bubble areas and we'll

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,520
notice those correlate

75
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:32,318
with street lights so this shows a great

76
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,719
visual of how light pollution or light

77
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,878
can

78
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,080
impact plants here and we see this again

79
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,079
on a soybean field

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
with just the street light's impact on

81
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,080
some of the green coloration we see

82
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,199
in this crop so looking at metal halides

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
to hps

84
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,199
flip for cannabis some people will grow

85
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,000
in a metal halide at the veg and then

86
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,598
flip over

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519
when they go to the flowering stage go

88
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,119
to high pressure sodiums

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,280
and that's usually a metal halide for 18

90
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
hour days and high pressure sodium flour

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
for 12 hours

92
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,479
metal halides have about 30 blue to keep

93
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,039
plants short with tight internodes

94
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,799
hps only has about four percent blue but

95
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,039
is still a very efficient light because

96
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,719
of the red orange spectrum it produces

97
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,079
green photons are important for visual

98
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,878
disease diagnosis

99
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
and as a source of comparison sunlight

100
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,959
does have about 30

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,400
blue light in it as well so as i

102
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,039
mentioned those kind of pictures

103
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
uh graphs that we'll see here here we're

104
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,840
looking at a

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
sunlight spectrum just to kind of give

106
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,200
you an idea looking at mainly that par

107
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,199
range uvb uva far red

108
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,439
and kind of the roy g biv spectrum here

109
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,959
for light frequency produced

110
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,280
and it's a one to thirty uvba ratio

111
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,640
for uh sunlight spectrum if we go to

112
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
high pressure sodium spectrum we're

113
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,598
noticing just if we go back and forth

114
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,879
for just a couple seconds sunlight

115
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,518
here's high pressure sodium back and

116
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,199
forth we're seeing a massive change here

117
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
in the amount of light frequency that's

118
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,719
produced by the high pressure sodium

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
spectrum

120
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,000
then we also have some grow light

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,199
spectrum these are white leds producing

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
3500 kelvin again to give you this that

123
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,079
comparison

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,199
of what what spectrum is being produced

125
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
by some of these lights

126
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,399
but you should always be checking with

127
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,719
your specific light

128
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,400
bulb or manufacturer should be able to

129
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,238
provide you with one of these

130
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,759
spectrum graphs so also in addition

131
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,518
we if you're not aware of there's

132
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,079
something called the dlc which is the

133
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,399
design

134
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,918
light consortium for light efficiency

135
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,599
it's an independent company that lists

136
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,560
many lights from different manufacturers

137
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,479
and published

138
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
test results for the efficiencies of

139
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,159
lights 2.5

140
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
and greater micro moles per joule is

141
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,840
considered to be a very efficient light

142
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,000
and this is kind of a non-profit

143
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,439
organization that can help kind of

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
provide you with some more

145
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,319
details and information potentially

146
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
about lights that you might be

147
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,000
considering purchasing

148
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,040
so you make the best selection for your

149
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,319
grow area

150
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720
and again as always if you want to learn

151
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,079
more i've provided you with some great

152
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
names here to go through

153
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,199
take a look special thanks to them in

154
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,280
the research of course that they've done

155
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,800
to contribute to the information

156
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,959
presented here

157
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
and research all over so you can

158
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,599
hopefully become an

159
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,638
informed consumer when you're looking at

160
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
purchasing lights
