1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,798
here we're going to look at three

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,569
important glands of the endocrine system

3
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:08,519
the thyroid parathyroid and adrenal

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,250
glands you can see our thyroid and

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,388
parathyroid are located very close in

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,580
proximity to one another

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,980
in the throat region and then our

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,070
adrenal glands are located on top of our

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,439
both left and right kidney so starting

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,660
first with the thyroid gland where it

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,129
lies just below the Adam's apple

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,579
in front of the neck you could see it

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:32,479
located here and highlighted right there

14
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:35,099
it's two most important home runs are

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,799
thyroxine which is increases the

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,859
metabolic rate and promotes growth and

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,929
it contains iodine lack of iodine in the

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,179
diet can cause Gators which we're going

19
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,909
to take a look at so thyroxine if we

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,500
don't they're looking for the iodine it

21
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,750
contains iodine if there's a lack of

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,058
iodine this is gonna swell up and get

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,448
quite large and result in a goiter

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:59,459
calcitonin is the other hormone that's

25
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:02,729
important and that's stimulates calcium

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,159
deposition in bone puts calcium into

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,728
bones calcitonin that Gorda that I

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,950
mentioned

29
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,170
iron deficiency causes the thyroid to

30
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,320
enlarge that tries to produce the

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,478
hormone thyroxine it getting larger can

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,149
ultimately look like this and this is an

33
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,849
extreme case the where do we get iodine

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,250
in our diet a lot of times insult will

35
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,169
see what's called iodized salt and those

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,540
small amounts of trace amounts of iodine

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,228
located in there can help prevent a

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,799
goiter from forming to keep the thyroid

39
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:36,688
gland it's normal size when the hormone

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,220
is the parathyroid gland and this is

41
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:39,868
when it's located I could say too close

42
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,569
proximity to the thyroid gland and

43
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:45,359
there's four small glands you see here

44
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,889
one two three four that are attached to

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,599
the thyroid and they produce the

46
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,859
parathyroid hormone typically

47
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:55,169
abbreviated P th one of only two

48
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,239
hormones essential for survival next is

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,939
a fail-safe mechanism ensuring calcium

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,500
levels never fall to low regulating

51
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,500
calcium is very important I have another

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,938
video series on that and this is kind of

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,828
that failsafe hormone the hormone

54
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:11,430
preventing it from getting too low if

55
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:13,949
calcium gets too low in the body that

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,080
can easily cause death too

57
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,149
because calcium ions are key for muscle

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,390
contractions it's their main part and

59
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,879
remember that your heart is a form of a

60
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:25,589
muscle when levels are low PTH

61
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,900
stimulates osteoclast cells to break

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,210
down the bone matrix ensuring that that

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,539
99% of calcium you have reserved in your

64
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,210
bones

65
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,409
shirring that 1% is always present in

66
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,240
your circulatory system

67
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,379
this will cause a raise and calcium

68
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,030
levels in the blood the adrenal glands

69
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:44,639
see them located here but the left and

70
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,009
the right are two glands located just

71
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,958
above each kidney they're composed of

72
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,929
two parts the medulla which is the inner

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,340
core you see here and this is

74
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,069
responsible for adrenaline and

75
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,840
norepinephrine this releases in times of

76
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,359
stress too soon a rapid deployment of

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,250
body fuel and then there's the cortex

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,430
which is the outer shells we see here

79
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,319
and that is cortisol that's its demise

80
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,370
carbohydrate metabolism and reduces

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,349
inflammation all the testerone is also

82
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,680
important first two million kidney

83
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,680
uptake of sodium and other ions from the

84
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,230
urine when our kidneys are doing

85
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,319
excretion and also retention of certain

86
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:27,750
ions this is the other hormone that's

87
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,609
absolutely essential for survival so the

88
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,229
couple essential for survival hormones

89
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,989
and that's the other one as I mentioned

90
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:35,759
number two hopefully this is helpful to

91
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,930
understand some of the glands are very

92
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,929
important in recruiting system
