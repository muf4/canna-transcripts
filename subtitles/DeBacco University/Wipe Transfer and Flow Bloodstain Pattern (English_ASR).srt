1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
here we're going to look at wipe

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,400
transfer and flow blood stain pattern

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,399
interpretation

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,240
so be able to tell the difference

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,080
between these and also

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,599
what each of these can tell us about

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,638
what may have occurred at the crime

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
scene

9
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,118
so first off we have wipe patterns these

10
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,600
occur when an object moves through a

11
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,399
blood stain feathered edges suggest the

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,240
direction

13
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,839
so we're looking kind of here at a white

14
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,959
pattern this could be

15
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,118
events of struggle this could be

16
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,920
evidence of a body being moved

17
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,640
this is very important to be able to try

18
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,800
to

19
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,759
look at how that object may have moved

20
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,000
because we knew

21
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,238
that when it moved in this wipe pattern

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,039
the blood stain was wet at the time

23
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
so this is very fresh and very recent

24
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,039
from when the blood was actually

25
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,719
deposited

26
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,719
in this area wipes in swipes pattern

27
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,879
may offer some insight into the events

28
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,719
at the scene as they were occurring

29
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,718
so investigators should be aware that

30
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
events during the active scene may

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,480
disturb previously deposited stains so

32
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,238
it's trying to get the timing or the

33
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,679
sequence of what may have occurred

34
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,319
so they said these wipe in these fight

35
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,879
patterns to give us an a glimpse at the

36
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,000
active crime scene but keep in mind they

37
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,719
might destroy

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
previously deposited evidence we have

39
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,519
transfer patterns

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
these occur when a wet blade object

41
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,200
contacts the secondary surface

42
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
very little blood is needed to produce a

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,640
stain or to transfer it to the other

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,400
objects mirror images of blade objects

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
is what is produced types of patterns

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,359
can be created by bloody footwear

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,280
fingerprints hairs and also fabrics

48
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,040
pattern transfer stains are often

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,879
overlooked but can provide class or

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
identifying characteristics

51
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,478
in the example here we're looking at a

52
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,920
shoe this might be able to determine

53
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,078
potentially the type of shoe or the type

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,359
of tread the type of size

55
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,599
this can tell us some good information

56
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,438
in addition to it just being a bloody

57
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,039
kind of transfer pattern there might be

58
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,798
more we can glean from this and it's

59
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,118
important to take pictures document the

60
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,520
size because it may be used later

61
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,680
to kind of connect other pieces of

62
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,280
evidence that are found

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
we also have the pattern transfer

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,718
evaluation here we want to look for

65
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,959
patterns within

66
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,399
the stain itself so you want to compare

67
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,519
characteristics with

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,159
any item class characteristics so while

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
exact matches are unlikely in this type

70
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,520
because the stain would have to have

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,439
been created under complex

72
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
conditions can provide this class

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,878
evidence the goal is to create a range

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,479
of standards for comparison as this may

75
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,359
be a group of suspect items recovered

76
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,119
from the scene

77
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760
and compare these standards with the

78
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,599
stain a good example of that would be

79
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,199
a shoe print pattern you know not be

80
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,199
able to produce some

81
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,399
exact same shoe with maybe some exact

82
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,919
trademarks

83
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
treadwear i should say but the general

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,518
tread marks might be able to be used so

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,719
again as a form of class

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
evidence now transfer from here or here

87
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,519
swipe this is kind of a zoomed in

88
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
version here we're looking at a crime

89
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
scene

90
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,439
we zoom in on the wall here we can see

91
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,280
this um what the

92
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,719
transfer from the hair or the hair swipe

93
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
blood pattern looks like

94
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,400
it's going to give just that kind of

95
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
real realistic kind of image on what may

96
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
have occurred

97
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,199
and remember this can be used with other

98
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,519
things you may find throughout the crime

99
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,518
scene to be able to tell the story

100
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,200
lastly here we have flow patterns and

101
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,280
this is blood flows from the fundamental

102
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,158
laws of physics and gravity and indicate

103
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,039
body movement after the onset of blood

104
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,479
flow

105
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,479
so this is important because this is

106
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,598
often an irregular pattern

107
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,518
or patterns that are different from

108
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,119
those to be expected may indicate that

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,000
the body was moved or

110
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,480
or an object was in the way so this can

111
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,318
be

112
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,759
shown here we have an individual sadly

113
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,199
bleeding here at the head

114
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,719
flow pattern we expect it to fall in

115
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,679
this general direction but we have an

116
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,439
object it may

117
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,719
kind of collect around there might flow

118
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,878
around that object

119
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,719
that can give us an idea of placement of

120
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,280
things in the room at the time

121
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,199
here we see kind of the regular kind of

122
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,719
flow pattern expected to gravity

123
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,798
and we see it coming in contact with the

124
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,799
surface here and adjusting

125
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,840
so again all these things taking into

126
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,879
consideration

127
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
can help us develop an idea of what may

128
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,798
have occurred at the particular crime

129
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
scene
