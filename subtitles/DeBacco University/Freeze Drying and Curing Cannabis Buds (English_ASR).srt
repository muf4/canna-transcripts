1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,759
going to go over freeze drying and

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,439
curing cannabis buds which is kind of a

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,880
unique process

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,638
that's kind of entering the cannabis

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,799
world and

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,079
probably here to stay because it does

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,838
produce a very

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
interesting end product in a very short

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,600
duration of time so hopefully this video

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,759
lecture will give you some insight into

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:30,960
this unique method of drying and curing

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:32,480
cannabis buds

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,399
all right let's look at freeze drying

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,398
and carrying cannabis buds

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,079
so this is not a new method so i don't

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,520
want to think this is completely new and

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,039
never heard of it before but

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,719
the general concept has been around for

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,439
many years and got its start in the food

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,439
industry

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,439
it is gaining popularity with it with

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,599
cannabis since it can shorten the curing

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,000
process to less than two days

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,480
some companies are even claiming 24 to

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,558
36 hour total curing process

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,959
with no loss in quality maybe even

28
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,519
improved quality this can also be done

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,520
by

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
home growers as well as large scale

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,118
commercial operations so it's not just

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,079
limited to one particular grower

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,599
it can be applied to both situations but

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,239
definitely important this reduced

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,919
curing time much much more advantageous

36
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,199
in the large scale commercial operations

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,478
that may have a lot of buds to go

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
through

39
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,679
so hanging versus freeze drying this is

40
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,359
just kind of like a little

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
quick little comparison kind of between

42
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,840
the two typical hang dry

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,478
you're looking at that 60 to 70 degrees

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,280
fahrenheit between 45 and 55

45
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,959
percent humidity too hot is not good it

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
can break down the terpenes

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,078
it does take time can take upwards of

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,320
three weeks

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,158
potentially so again those are the

50
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,559
traditional hang to dry

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,320
freeze drying says that it of course

52
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,240
maintains its freshness

53
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,758
really kind of like pauses the plant

54
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,478
ideally in time

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,118
it's very fast they can say about 24

56
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,039
hours

57
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,478
you can go through the entire process

58
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
and basically freeze drying will

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,560
preserve

60
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,239
and allow us to maintain the terpene in

61
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
cannabinoids because basically the

62
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,478
enzymes

63
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,920
are frozen in place nothing is going to

64
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,118
go through the breakdown process it's

65
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
going to be literally as the name

66
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,080
implies

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,598
frozen in place so again this is a nice

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
comparison between the two

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,839
both can result in quality end products

70
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,040
but freeze drying does offer some

71
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,200
intermediate uh benefits there

72
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,959
simply there's no heat needed so with

73
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,958
the absence of heat with this curing

74
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
process the physical buds cannabinoids

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,520
and terpenes

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
can be better preserved since they're

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
frozen in time

78
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
in a short curing cycle so you need to

79
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,759
add any heat they're literally frozen

80
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
in time it's a great way to preserve and

81
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,639
maintain

82
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,318
the original contents without risk of

83
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,000
degradation

84
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,280
now there's also reduced curing time

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,318
again compared to the traditional

86
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
hanging method

87
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,679
reduced curing time not only makes the

88
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,319
general process attractive to production

89
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,760
growers

90
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,000
but there is the additional benefit of

91
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,359
reducing the risk of mold or mildew

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,039
developing within the process because

93
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
you've taken that duration of time

94
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,039
and you've really shortened it up

95
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
there's again they're saying about 24

96
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,239
hours

97
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,919
and it does take specialized equipments

98
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,560
and nothing's you know completely

99
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,679
easy but once set up this is a very

100
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
attractive

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,599
curing process so just the basics of it

102
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,039
well the

103
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,799
phase one is the name would imply would

104
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,318
be defreezing it's a quick freezing

105
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
process where the buds are exposed to

106
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,799
negative four degrees fahrenheit or even

107
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,959
colder

108
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
the colder temperatures may be harder to

109
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
achieve but are advantageous to ensure

110
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,878
maximum freshness however colder is

111
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,200
better to some extent

112
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,120
once you get below minus 80 fahrenheit i

113
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,639
really have diminishing benefits

114
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,719
if you can go lower than minus 80 you've

115
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,359
got a really special cryogenic freezer

116
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,560
but really

117
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,640
you don't need to go much more than

118
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,158
minus 80 minus 40 to minus 80 is a good

119
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,439
target range fahrenheit

120
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,959
the temperature should be maintained for

121
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,919
at least 10 hours to help preserve the

122
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,239
physical structure

123
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,598
of the buds there so again little

124
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,719
temperature and a little duration of

125
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,560
time

126
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,560
then we get to kind of the kind of the

127
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,239
stage of what's called sublimation

128
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,598
now sublimation is the process of

129
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,438
changing from a solid

130
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,119
to a gas without passing through the

131
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,359
intermediate liquid phase

132
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
so it's solid directly to gas would be

133
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
sublimation

134
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,238
this does occur in nature when ice on

135
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,280
snow from the earth's surface changes to

136
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
water vapor

137
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
in the air without first melting into

138
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
water kind of a unique concept tends to

139
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,439
occur

140
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,359
a little bit more commonly in kind of

141
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,680
the midwestern part of the united states

142
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,519
going right from solid ice or snow

143
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,879
directly to water vapor

144
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,199
the opposite sublimation the gas

145
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,120
directly to a solid is called deposition

146
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
and this is where water vapor changes

147
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
directly from into ice

148
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
such as snowflakes as well as frost

149
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,000
during the curing

150
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,279
process with a cannabis a vacuum pump is

151
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
used to reduce the pressure

152
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,839
which changes the sublimation point this

153
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,800
is how we're able to achieve those

154
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,319
points by changing the pressure and then

155
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,160
there's controlled heat added

156
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,599
to convert the frozen moisture directly

157
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,280
into water vapor

158
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,639
so it's a very controlled process that's

159
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,439
why we're using those kind of

160
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
cryogenic freezer vesicles to aid in

161
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,360
this

162
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
then capturing that water vapor so with

163
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
controlled systems the water vapor

164
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
would be captured as ice to help ensure

165
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,439
no terpenes are lost from the process

166
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,119
the terpenes will have to be used as

167
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,279
alternate products not dry flour

168
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,280
such as vapes or oils but there is a way

169
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,599
to ensure there's no loss by

170
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,719
condensing down that water vapor any

171
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
terpenes that were caught in that water

172
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,680
vapor can then be captured and used in

173
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,439
other products

174
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,879
so they're not being wasted as part of

175
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,519
the process

176
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,240
then lastly that final dry so during the

177
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,079
process

178
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,280
the temperature is raised to 70 to 80

179
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,560
degrees fahrenheit

180
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,079
which is when the water content is

181
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,600
removed and it offers the grocery

182
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,560
ability to adjust the amount of final

183
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
moisture content

184
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
that remains with controlled systems

185
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
this water content is under the grower's

186
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,639
regulation

187
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,799
so they're allowed to go through and

188
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,319
test and see and here we're looking at

189
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
an example of a dry trim here between

190
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,959
eight and ten percent oyster but

191
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,799
whatever the grower desires

192
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,399
they can kind of dial that in during the

193
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
final drying process

194
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,560
so again this might be something a

195
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,479
little bit more applicable to

196
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
large-scale growers but this cryogenic

197
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:50,719
freezing

198
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,319
is being applied to cannabis more and

199
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,199
more hopefully this gives you a little

200
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,719
insight

201
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
into it if you want to consider it for

202
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,039
your operation or at least if you're

203
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,479
aware of it

204
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,478
if you hear it mentioned
