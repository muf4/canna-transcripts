1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,459
can we talk about HP escrow lights which

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,620
stands for high pressure sodium they're

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,300
very easy to distinguish because they

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,359
tend to produce this kind of yellowish

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,219
orange coloration to their a light

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,559
spectrum at least interpreted by the

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,868
human eye these high pressure sodium

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,479
lights much like metal halides are most

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,550
common in 600 and thousand watts super

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,528
bulbs just says with middle halides will

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,240
be brighter than this standard bulb the

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,129
most commonly used during flowering or

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,589
fruiting phase but can be used over the

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,140
entire grow cycle I've had plants go

15
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,820
from germination and little seedlings

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,159
all the way to flowering over the

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,619
fruiting under high-pressure sodium

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,689
lights they can generate more light than

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,299
a middle halide because of increased

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,280
efficiencies that they have but they can

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,988
also increase stem stretching is a

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,670
possibility to occur

23
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,959
want to be careful watch on which part

24
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,600
you're giving the plant that can help

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,820
reduce the impact of that making that

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,210
nice yellow kind of oranges look is very

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,719
common with HPS lights they produce that

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,599
yellow orange color light favours the 21

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,820
100 to 22 K will to Stanford Calvin

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,769
spectrum again that's just referring to

31
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,199
the coloration very little that is

32
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,149
impacted the plant or how we perceive it

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,270
high pressure sodium bulb life is rate

34
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,830
about 5000 hours but again most growers

35
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,709
are changing their bulbs out in a year

36
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,359
or less about 5000 hours in higher

37
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,469
quality lights will still give you about

38
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:30,810
95% efficiency so some growth will run a

39
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,129
little bit longer but be mindful of the

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,040
yield that you're looking to get and the

41
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,989
efficiencies can be very important the

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,350
pros I bet your sodium lights we see two

43
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:42,478
right here just cooling down the very

44
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,039
cost efficient as prices have dropped

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,409
with other technologies and during the

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,149
marketplace so that's another great

47
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,219
option that they're becoming cheaper per

48
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,680
fixture overall the technology is very

49
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,688
good although it's reached its peak it

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,240
may be replaced by LED lights going

51
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,398
forward and bulbs need to be replaced

52
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,069
and at least a yearly basis and the

53
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,989
reflectors typically every other year to

54
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,599
maybe every three at max every four

55
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,810
years example the high-pressure sodium

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,180
light this is a Kavita Pro 1000 de this

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,800
is a thousand watt double ended a light

58
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,500
fixture here and ballast all

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,780
inclusive well Kavita there kind of

60
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,090
claim to fame is they make lamps for

61
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,250
plants they're very much involved in the

62
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,960
horticultural lighting they ship

63
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,340
everything all inclusive they basically

64
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,180
pull out of the package and plug it in

65
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,189
you're good to go

66
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,650
these also have a dimmer on them which

67
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,509
is great if you're looking at maximizing

68
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,250
the versatility of using these lights

69
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,870
they run cool and efficient these

70
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,020
ballasts are cool to the touch even when

71
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,689
they're running they can be used for the

72
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,130
veg phase in production due to the broad

73
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,039
spectrum that these lights produce

74
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,199
that's just one example here of the

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,479
category under high-pressure sodium

76
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,479
lights that abbreviated HPS
