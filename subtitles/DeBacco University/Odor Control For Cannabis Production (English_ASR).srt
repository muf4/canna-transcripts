1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,040
so if you're involved with cannabis

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,278
production you may want to be

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,080
considering some form of odor control

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,000
depending

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,800
who your neighbors are who's in your

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,638
vicinity as a result debaco university

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,599
here will provide you some ideas and

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
suggestions

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
for odor control

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,400
[Music]

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
all right if you're looking for ways to

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,719
reduce the odor of your cannabis plants

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,039
you've come to the right place

14
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,079
so first off keep in mind that filters

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,120
make a good addition

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,439
in general whether we're looking at

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,359
removing odors or not

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,039
it's good to kind of have those in place

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,479
but utilizing intake filters

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,719
in particular can help control air

21
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,799
that's being brought into the grow area

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,759
this can involve removal of insects and

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,759
also

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,839
particles from the air but these will

25
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,039
not impact the odor around the plants

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
so here we're specifically going to be

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,439
targeting the smell generated by the

28
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,078
cannabis

29
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,000
plants so if we've grown canvas plants

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
there is that distinctive odor

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,320
that they do produce every early on

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,600
plants will have a minimal amount of

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,558
odor so you might think oh we're getting

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,640
bite is fine

35
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,759
however in the three to five weeks old

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,439
odor will start to become

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,359
apparent and odor will start in the

38
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,199
vegetative stage but will really become

39
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,079
much more apparent during the flowering

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,280
stage

41
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,959
so if odor is an issue early keep in

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,519
mind that it'll become a much bigger

43
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,118
issue

44
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,719
later in the growing cycle so you want

45
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,239
to plan for that ahead of time

46
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,000
there's not when the plants are small

47
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,759
it's only going to get quote worse

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680
or more prevalent so you want to be

49
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,438
considering an odor

50
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,720
control option now you want to consider

51
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,559
your neighbors meaning

52
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,400
while odor control has little impact on

53
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,000
the actual plant's productivity

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,600
it can be the difference between growing

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,519
or not growing your plants again

56
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,679
depending on who your neighbors are

57
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,438
or particularly where you're located

58
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
hard to do it in an outdoor situation

59
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,559
but for indoor situations

60
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,959
we have greater control and we'll go

61
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,478
over some of those options for you

62
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,679
so odor control and ventilation

63
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,200
hopefully you're having some form of

64
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
ventilation regardless

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
but the growing area because that

66
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
typically is required by the growing

67
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
area

68
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
so when it comes to odor control this

69
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,599
often requires some simple modifications

70
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,879
or additions

71
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,239
if you're moving air through and

72
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,878
ventilating your area like you should

73
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,800
anyway

74
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,318
adding one of these odor control options

75
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,680
should be fairly easy

76
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,079
once you've gone through the initial

77
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
investment so you want to consider the

78
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,280
different options you have available to

79
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,959
you there's not just one option

80
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,878
you want to evaluate the options and you

81
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
should take into account the size of the

82
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,159
area in the operation

83
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
and the degree of order control you want

84
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,479
to achieve or just looking at reducing a

85
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
little bit

86
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,479
or looking at really making it

87
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,159
non-existent so i want to present some

88
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,199
options here give you the advantage and

89
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,280
disadvantages

90
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,280
of all the options presented here you're

91
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,479
welcome to search tobacco university

92
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
here for more detail

93
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,238
on each of these starting with the first

94
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840
one here looking at carbon filters

95
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,599
the advantages is that it allows for

96
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,598
high airflow volumes

97
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,039
very easy to install and comes in a

98
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,399
variety of sizes

99
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,159
however the disadvantage with carbon

100
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
filters is they cannot be used

101
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,840
in highly humid conditions you start

102
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,919
getting above 75

103
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,158
plus percent humidity their

104
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,559
effectiveness really decreases

105
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,560
they also do not need to be changed out

106
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
after after a period of time so

107
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,759
keep in mind that you do need to change

108
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
these you just can't put them in there

109
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,399
and like up they're all set it's all my

110
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,840
carbon filter

111
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120
and if you notice after a couple grow

112
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
cycles it may not be working as

113
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
effectively

114
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,000
because they do need to be changed over

115
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
a period of time

116
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,439
don't just set it and forget it forever

117
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,719
they will need to be replaced at a

118
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,039
certain point

119
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,359
there's also ozone generators so the

120
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,199
advantage is no chemicals or residues

121
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
easy to use and operate however the

122
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,119
disadvantages is they cannot be used in

123
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,840
high traffic areas where people will be

124
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
present

125
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
and regulation ozone limits may limit

126
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,319
their effectiveness meaning the

127
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
degree of ozone that's needed for odor

128
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,000
control

129
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,120
kind of may conflict with certain limits

130
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
set by

131
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,239
certain governing agencies sprays and

132
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
absorbing gels as our last one the

133
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,280
advantages are very easy to add to a

134
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,039
ventilation system

135
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,039
the disadvantages they do not eliminate

136
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,959
they really only mask the odors

137
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,400
unlike some of the others that we have

138
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
talked about previously they will kind

139
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
of

140
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
these ones just kind of mask the odors

141
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,000
they also need frequent replacement

142
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,360
and need to be purchased in a timely

143
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,199
manner to when they're

144
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,879
planned to be used so if any of these

145
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,479
sounded of interest to you

146
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,598
welcome to search the channel to get
