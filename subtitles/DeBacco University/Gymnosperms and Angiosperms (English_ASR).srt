1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,278
okay in this video we're gonna look at

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,569
gymnosperms and angiosperms

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,300
if you don't know at this point

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,099
gymnosperms typically look like this

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,190
we're looking at pine trees being a

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,028
prime example in angiosperms being

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,980
plants that have produced many flowers

8
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:22,050
so gymnosperms to start with these there

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,420
is different um phyla that consist of

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,189
them focus mainly to study two main ones

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,960
here conifers is probably what you're

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,300
most familiar with there are trees that

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,340
produce their seeds and cones and most

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,679
have needle-like leaves it's the example

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,290
of conifers be another example look out

16
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,909
over here well you might be familiar

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,308
with say barb Kinkos or at least

18
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,019
familiar hearing about only one living

19
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,339
species left but what makes them

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,520
distinctive is that they have these

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,950
being shaped leaves so both of these are

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,780
in gymnosperms so I want to think it's

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,879
just only needle-like leaves they can

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,590
also have these kind of fan shaped

25
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,649
leaves and these should be classified

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,570
both as what we call naked seed plants

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,128
here in angiosperms are going to be

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,459
those flowering so these don't actually

29
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:07,798
produce set flowers they're producing

30
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,728
them in this case these cones but they

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,470
both are producing seeds so sticking

32
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:15,478
with the gymnosperms a life cycle of

33
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,069
conifers is typical of gymnosperms

34
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,530
that's our reasoning them kind of as our

35
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,959
example here kind of forms from two

36
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,640
types of cones seed cones contain the

37
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,548
female communitites and it's located

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,989
here and pollen cones contain pollen

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,360
grains which is the male gametophyte

40
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:32,399
it's may look like this pollen grains

41
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,739
are dispersed by wind to the seed comes

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,439
the fertilized seed cones produce seeds

43
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,879
which are also when dispersed the

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,078
Germany and seed will grow into new

45
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,688
sporophyte

46
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,129
plant you see that here if you've ever

47
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,339
looked out particularly the springtime

48
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:49,259
and it looks like a pine trees on fire

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,439
so I think it's smoke who's pouring out

50
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,688
of it it's literally the pollen so that

51
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,968
what these gymnosperms do in this case

52
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,779
these conifers they're producing a lot

53
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,269
of pollen

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,790
they're dispersing it through the air in

55
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,968
hopes that just by mass producing pollen

56
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,729
they're able by odds to get the male

57
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:11,280
pollen grains to find the female ovule

58
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,690
here again they're just producing tons

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
and tons and tons of pollen it can

60
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:18,900
almost click smoke

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,269
a tree to find that female ovule in

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,920
contrast to that angiosperms they

63
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:24,390
produce flowers they invest a lot of

64
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,619
energy in these flowers to attract

65
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,649
pollinators so a little different

66
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,420
reproductive strategy here ninety

67
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,060
percent of all living plant species are

68
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,708
angiosperms virtually all of our food is

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,289
derived directly or indirectly from

70
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,019
angiosperms you see here angiosperms

71
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:42,780
whose flower to induce insects and other

72
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,639
animals to carry pollen for them so in

73
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,680
example here instead of these plants

74
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,379
investing a ton of energy and producing

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,810
a lot of just pollen grains and hoping

76
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,668
it makes it with the wind they're

77
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,530
investing their energy and reducing the

78
00:02:53,669 --> 00:03:00,060
less pollen but at bending time to

79
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,739
attract pollinators flower Anatomy so

80
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,289
the basic structure of flower consists

81
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:08,310
of four distinctive circles here or

82
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:10,918
whirls connected to the base here four

83
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,989
key terms sepals are the outermost world

84
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,750
and typically protect the flower from

85
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,729
physical damage the petals were probably

86
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,919
most familiar with their the second

87
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:23,069
world to serve to attract pollinators

88
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,290
and that's what looks usually it looks

89
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:28,738
pretty the stamens can name the male

90
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,929
parts we see here that produced the

91
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,639
pollen at the tip of the filament is an

92
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,489
anther that contains the pollen we see

93
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,189
that kind of zoomed in portion here this

94
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,019
green region here on the pistol or the

95
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:42,478
carpel contains the female parts that

96
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,609
produced the egg the ovules occurs the

97
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,220
Bolton base of the carpel called the

98
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,049
ovary the stalk is called the style and

99
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,419
this gives rise from the ovary to the

100
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,879
end of the sticky tip called a stigma

101
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,040
which receives the pollen so sometimes

102
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,929
this portion here stigma but I want to

103
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,959
think of sticky stigma and then the

104
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,269
style and then we have down here the

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,000
ovary so Paula needs to go from the

106
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,359
anther here to be transferred to this

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,219
stigma so it can reach the ovary good

108
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,870
terms you should be kind of reviewing me

109
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:17,038
familiar with a meal to identify

110
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,329
different parts of the flower again

111
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:21,029
looking at that in a slightly different

112
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,468
image here you see the same thing the

113
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,709
carpals the statements the petals and

114
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:26,228
sepals

115
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:28,689
on a different flower here so you don't

116
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:30,699
just accustomed to just this one single

117
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:33,098
set image be able to recognize it on

118
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,689
different images same thing here you see

119
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:37,659
a lot of the same stuff the female and

120
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:40,149
male parts and Christmas

121
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,569
lilium very distinctive pollen grains

122
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,698
here and we notice her stigma or sticky

123
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:49,680
stigma on the Polly's to get in here to

124
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,680
here and travel down here to the ovule

125
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,689
again zooming in on those parts here

126
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,879
that's all for to the side and we can

127
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:03,160
see that there is a very similar

128
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,709
distinctive regions but we want me to be

129
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,680
able to distinguish the different male

130
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:11,739
and female portions and realize that the

131
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,509
stigma this style and the ovary of the

132
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,579
ovule here are all part of the female

133
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,620
the pollen grains the microspores the

134
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:25,560
anthers the filaments all of those are

135
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,560
portions of the male parts on the flower
