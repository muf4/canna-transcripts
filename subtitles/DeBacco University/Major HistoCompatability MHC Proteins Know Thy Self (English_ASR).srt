1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
okay here we look at the MHC proteins

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,099
which stands for major

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:10,320
histocompatibility proteins but the note

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,809
here of know thyself this is how cells

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,330
are able to interact and recognize one

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:18,329
another these MHC proteins are very

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,149
important so class 1 in a class 2 and

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,618
we'll look at those in more detail so

9
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,659
starting with that know thyself here

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:29,339
quote know the enemy and know yourself

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,640
in a hundred battles you'll never be

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,259
defeated so this is part of the immune

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,200
system it needs to be able to identify

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:39,030
the enemy but it also needs to know

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,930
itself be able to recognize what self

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,070
cells are so it doesn't attack those so

17
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,929
the first step is I get to find the

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,960
enemy so what's our first kind of

19
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,329
process here well we've been recognized

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,030
our own cells and every cell in the body

21
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,090
carries the surface markers the surface

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,890
markers are called MHC proteins

23
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,489
specifically they're called major

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,539
histocompatibility proteins these MHC

25
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,390
proteins are different for each

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,478
individual they acted self markers so

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,879
class one has basically one binding site

28
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,859
here to the cell in class two has two

29
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,438
binding sites we can see an example here

30
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,959
of our class twos and class ones these

31
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,938
are class 2-z these are class ones these

32
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,559
are ones and these are twos this

33
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,438
indicates even further which ones came

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,290
from a maternal line Fortunes came from

35
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,809
a maternal line and a paternal line from

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,469
mom and from dad so didn't find the

37
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,680
enemy's number one so we have inter gene

38
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:40,590
presenting cells sometimes abbreviated a

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,200
ap C cells they ingest off foreign

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,868
particles or partially digest them in

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,020
this case here we have a macrophage it's

42
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:52,019
in copes capsulated this bacterium in a

43
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,179
vacuole they then combine pieces of

44
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,649
foreign particles with MHC proteins and

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,840
move them to the surface

46
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,759
so our lysosomes here are digestive

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,790
enzymes are fusing with this bacterium

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,549
contant to break down and then here's

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,149
our antigen news our MHC class 2

50
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,209
receptors move the digested bacterium

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,969
and presenting it on the cell surface

52
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:16,539
t-cell receptors can only interact with

53
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:19,639
cells that have a combination of MHC and

54
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:22,069
antigen so this is why it's important to

55
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:25,069
have these MHC proteins incorporating

56
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,400
that that's helping identify as self and

57
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,229
not destroying the entire cell here this

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,439
image here has been a little time on

59
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:36,799
ions the antigen processing and

60
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:40,219
presenting steps so here we notice we

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,210
have a pathogen in this case it's being

62
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:46,069
ingested here and this pathogen or

63
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,590
extracellular antigen as indicated here

64
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,599
two different pathways are being taken

65
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,819
in by the cell being engulfed by the

66
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,579
cell phagocytized would be the proper

67
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,979
term to use in this indigent presenting

68
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,830
cell does aid in dendritic cell is

69
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:03,169
placed into a vesicle so received both

70
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,170
of these different pathways of antigen

71
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,299
being acquired from either inside the

72
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:10,519
din dendritic cell here were required

73
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,430
from outside the environment here being

74
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,709
placed into a vacuole this ingested

75
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,569
pathogens are digested by but the

76
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,500
digestive enzymes in the lysosome and

77
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:23,530
interacting with the antigens

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,539
now this lysosomes releasing these

79
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,569
enzymes these enzymes are breaking this

80
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:32,060
bacterium down maintaining the antigen

81
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,370
from the digested pathogen these

82
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:40,969
antigens bind with MHC proteins that

83
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:43,330
enter the the vesicle here so we notice

84
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:48,969
it's occurring with the bacterium and

85
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:51,799
also in the case here where we have our

86
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:54,289
extracellular antigen being going

87
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,920
through that same process it's important

88
00:03:54,289 --> 00:04:01,189
that these able are able to bind with

89
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,289
the MHC class 2 protein so that they can

90
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:05,299
be presented on the cell as we

91
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,829
progressed further i mean c proteins are

92
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,230
now carrying the antigens that are

93
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,580
released from the vesicle and travel to

94
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:13,340
the outer surface of the cell membrane

95
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,440
if they never reach the outer surface

96
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,439
our T cells won't be able to bind with

97
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,089
them meaning if our image c proteins

98
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,149
found at the antigen and were stayed

99
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:26,119
inside the cell there'd be no point our

100
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,829
T cells can only bind with receptors on

101
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,240
the cell surface so

102
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:31,098
it's very important this dendritic cell

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,680
is now presenting antigens on the cell

104
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:36,069
surface so that it's able to activate

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,840
t-cells that bind with the MHC proteins

106
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:41,449
this is helping the immune system be

107
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,478
able to recognize these foreign invaders

108
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:47,840
are these antigens require these antigen

109
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,418
processing cells APC cells to go through

110
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,968
this process to then display these on

111
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:55,399
the surface with the appropriate MHC

112
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:57,918
protein so our T cells can recognize

113
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,918
this itself American this is a formed

114
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,740
antigen and then initiate a potential

115
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,329
immune response so hopefully going

116
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,180
through and understanding this very

117
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:09,378
complex process was a little bit easier

118
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,418
welcome to pause the video and take a

119
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,550
look at this image here so you can

120
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:17,468
better understand the antigen processing

121
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,468
and presenting process
