1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
okay here I'm gonna go over different

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,439
types of cannabis cannabis indica sativa

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,138
root Alice and also hemp cannabis now

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,150
while these different types are kind of

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,029
ingrained in the industry we don't learn

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,060
here that the differences may not be as

7
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:20,789
great as you may initially think so

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,589
indicas sativa is rude Alice and hemp

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,630
cannabis may have different looks or

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,189
different morphologies but the actual

11
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,038
difference between these plants may not

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,240
be as great as you may think so but this

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,009
disclaimer here because there's

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,600
different morphologies that allow us to

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,789
classify this canvas and that's

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,870
typically what's used to denote them in

17
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:38,369
two different categories

18
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,530
however the phenotype does not always

19
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,049
match the genotype some backgrounds with

20
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,210
plants are also not well known due to

21
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:46,619
the blending of genetics while general

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,120
characteristics are presented please

23
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,570
realize that plant behavior may not

24
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,070
match the cannabinoids it can produce so

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,840
this naming inconsistency there's a

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,500
disconnect between research in the

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,360
general public

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,799
much of this traces back to the

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,600
underground market now hitting legal

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,939
challenges that have opened up the

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,618
market for more varieties to plants by

32
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,060
the same name may not be the same

33
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,129
genetic so we're getting into something

34
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,689
that may look initially the same but we

35
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,609
kind of go into the microscope and look

36
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,239
at the scientific end of it we're seeing

37
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:17,400
some great differences that do occur

38
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,839
so why contains be unpredictable

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,240
well breeders have been making crosses

40
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,430
and documenting so we would think they'd

41
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,298
be the accurate but without genetic

42
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,240
markers there's being a being trapped

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,880
there is a high odds of mix-ups

44
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,069
occurring just from grower error also

45
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,750
the possibility of misinformation being

46
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,849
spread for the purpose to protect

47
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,828
breeders varieties cannot be ruled out

48
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,228
so there are two kind of factors at play

49
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,269
that probably contribute the fact that

50
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,849
these names aren't necessarily directly

51
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,170
matching it up so how our name is

52
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,328
defined will often the structure of

53
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,430
morphology the plant defines the variety

54
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,078
this is not taken to consideration the

55
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,630
chemical profile of the plant it creates

56
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,000
an inaccurate correlation so we're kind

57
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,140
of basing a morphology and as you see

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,118
here with the plug if you know if it

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,560
fits it's got to be this variety if it

60
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,368
looks like this it's got to be this and

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,780
that's sadly not the case here so

62
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:11,098
genotype versus name it's possible for

63
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,509
the same variety from two different

64
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,669
suppliers to have vastly different

65
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:15,560
chemical profile

66
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:17,329
suppliers will often say if you find a

67
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,439
good strained stick with that supplier

68
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,040
but this is not a good long-term

69
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,269
solution this variability prevents

70
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,098
presents a huge challenge especially for

71
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,629
the medical market and as a result many

72
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:28,759
have chosen to go with extractions

73
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:30,139
rather than actual plant material so

74
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,109
that they can know exactly what they're

75
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:34,579
getting each and every time so what does

76
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,830
this mean it means you're not trust the

77
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,260
name matches a clearly defined set of

78
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,209
effects see here with the mouse and the

79
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,848
cat now should not always be trusting

80
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,469
the cat here peer extractions will

81
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,568
ensure consistent chemical profile

82
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,549
regardless of the starting material the

83
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,289
extractions can be found in purified

84
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,920
products which reduces very variability

85
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,509
compared to use of the flower genetics

86
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,068
versus observations there are databases

87
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,539
being constructed so future

88
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:01,189
understanding of cannabis genetics we

89
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,659
can clear however general

90
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,939
characteristics of the three main types

91
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,348
of camps will be presented here along

92
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:08,209
with some concerns of those

93
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:10,639
classifications but we are certain to

94
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,739
pool a greater dataset saying what we

95
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,949
see and also genetic markers for the

96
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:18,680
cannabis plant so canvas indica well the

97
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,929
origin has come the countries Pakistan

98
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,639
and Afghanistan we're colder climates

99
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,579
with shorter seasons that's kind of

100
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,719
where the indica can be traced back to

101
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,459
the morphology I called the George

102
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,590
Costanza of plants it's short and stocky

103
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,069
these leaves kind of had this morphology

104
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,930
as we see here sure in Saki leaves the

105
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:38,899
general behavior is conducive to indoor

106
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,299
growing where space is often limited due

107
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,530
to its morphology these dense plants

108
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,450
with broad leaves lead to heavy

109
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,810
production with the possibility of four

110
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:50,780
to six crops per calendar year it's

111
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,239
often marketed as offering relaxation

112
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,150
decreased nausea and pain and good for

113
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,009
nighttime use

114
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,629
sativa its origin is found more towards

115
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:02,568
the equator or the climate tends to be

116
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,250
warmer and longer also the average day

117
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,858
length is stable over the course of the

118
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,979
year so sativas thought to originate

119
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:12,290
near the at the equator okay and here

120
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:14,328
looking at the sativas morphology these

121
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:16,069
are considered to be like the giraffe of

122
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,139
cannabis plants they're tall and their

123
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:20,089
thin leaves are long and thin which is

124
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,199
kind of the opposite of indicas they're

125
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,759
physically the biggest of the three

126
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,439
varieties they tend to have more

127
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,230
continuous growth have it leaned a more

128
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,790
Ariat appearance then grow up

129
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,830
fifteen feet tall to produce higher

130
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,210
yields but sometimes it takes a little

131
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:33,339
bit longer for them to get to this stage

132
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:36,489
so it comes at the cost of sometimes

133
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:38,259
longer at flowering times in market is

134
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,819
as increased creativity for people

135
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,800
looking to get things done in daytime

136
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,810
use and this is what they're marketed as

137
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,930
but this doesn't necessarily mean all

138
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,660
sativas will have this so the indica or

139
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,610
sativa abate despite clear distinction

140
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,960
there is widely presented in the

141
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,730
marketplace actually there's very

142
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,500
limited scientific evidence to support

143
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,689
the separation between the indicas and

144
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,129
the sativas are there morphological

145
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,899
differences well yes

146
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,000
however the strain classification does

147
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:06,039
not match the chemical profile

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,319
sativas and indicas can have similar

149
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,290
chemical profiles despite very different

150
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,490
morphologies so indica or sativa the

151
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,140
specific classification does not

152
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,879
correlate with the particular affect or

153
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,519
compounds produced and this is a big

154
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,350
point to kind of remember here while

155
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,479
plants look differently different this

156
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,700
is the only distinction between the tail

157
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,319
so the chemical profiles can videos can

158
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,860
be the same even though they may look

159
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,709
very different and this is despite what

160
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,780
typically is marketed as one producing

161
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:37,539
one effects in another they can actually

162
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:39,909
produce very similar effects would alice

163
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,910
is an auto flowering cultivar of

164
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,260
cannabis its origin is kind of in cold

165
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,120
regions of countries like Russia and

166
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:49,120
China and this could be a distant

167
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,560
relative sativa potentially because it's

168
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,110
autoflowering its heavens own

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,089
classification it's a new kid on the

170
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,920
block the morphology is I call it the

171
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:59,229
hummingbird of plants it's small and

172
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,480
fast it's recognizable by its small

173
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,400
leaves and minimal side branches as this

174
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,310
kind of refresh on your plant structure

175
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,839
with thicker stems now it's an auto

176
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,120
climb strain which eliminates the need

177
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,310
to be precise with photo period as it

178
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,590
will flower after three to four weeks of

179
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,939
growth no matter the time of year three

180
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,949
harvests seventy two hundred and ten

181
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,719
days recedes this is an advantage of

182
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,370
having this auto flowering kind of comes

183
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,790
a robot kind of becomes like automated

184
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,319
as often uses crosses with other strains

185
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,510
to increase yield and have the auto

186
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,740
flowering characteristic carry over so

187
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,800
that growers don't have to worry about

188
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,960
the photo period adjustments naturally

189
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,060
low and T&amp;T is how it h sees how its

190
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,699
marketed short lifecycle annotation

191
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,470
being incorporated into other hybrids

192
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,000
to give the best of both worlds kind of

193
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,610
is that quick cheetah like turnaround

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,490
time can can kind of create this mixture

195
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,009
of two different varieties with good

196
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,050
potency and auto flowering plant which

197
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,019
is what growers typically find

198
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,810
advantageous the general morphological

199
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,979
summary here indica sativa ruderalis you

200
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,410
can kind of see now the comparison

201
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,240
between the three and how they look very

202
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,620
differently but again keep in mind the

203
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,000
chemical profiles that they produce

204
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,000
could be very similar
