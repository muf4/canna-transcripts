1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
on this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,919
going to go over

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,399
outdoor site evaluation if keeping in

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,839
mind

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:17,440
if you want to have that site for

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:18,960
cannabis production

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
all right let's get into outdoor site

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,199
evaluation for cannabis production

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,679
well first off there's five main

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,560
evaluation kind of standpoints here

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,118
you want to look at the history visual

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,278
physical

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,519
chemical and regulatory evaluation of

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,320
any site that you might be considering

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
to produce cannabis in and all none of

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
these are

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,839
more important than the other they all

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,679
kind of should go through

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,440
and go to go through the evaluation

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,519
process and make sure

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,960
that you meet all of those proper

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,440
evaluation standpoints

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,558
so that you're able to go into a field

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,320
knowing

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,679
you have all these at least passing all

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,600
these checkpoints because there'll be

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,640
plenty challenges growing outdoors in

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
general

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
so first off the history evaluation so

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,439
when we're talking about the history

31
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,558
evaluation well

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,679
what was the site used for before was it

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,118
dairy farming

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
uh it's likely to have be high in

35
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,599
phosphorus was it industrial

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,118
applications

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,959
are there any potential contaminants to

38
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,799
consider was it the hay field

39
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,079
uh is the p the ph might need to be

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,680
corrected um

41
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,280
why is it available other questions just

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,479
to ask there is someone just abandoning

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920
the farm or they obeying it because it

44
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,679
wasn't productive for them

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
so these are just kind of like histories

46
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
things you can ask about

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,359
looking back at kind of what it was used

48
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,759
for and have an idea of what you might

49
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,000
be

50
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,680
walking into or at least we should maybe

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
have a little indication of what you

52
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,240
spend a little more time

53
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
reviewing then we did the simple visual

54
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,879
evaluation

55
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,960
so this is the most basic and should be

56
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,920
performed via simple computer search and

57
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,399
also a simple

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
on-site look there's great satellite

59
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,239
imagery

60
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,759
so you can find a quick visual

61
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,399
inspection what's going on hopefully you

62
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,560
can go there

63
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
as well now if you do make it out to the

64
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,359
field or have an option to make it out

65
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,280
to the field

66
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,799
it's good to make the evaluation after a

67
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
recent rainstorm because you want to

68
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
have an idea of how it may drain

69
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,079
or where water might be flowing to or

70
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,519
from within a field

71
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,559
now what plant species are currently

72
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,079
growing when you make that visual

73
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,719
inspection things you should be asking

74
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,399
yourself

75
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,000
is it many weed species is it very

76
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,840
disturbed soil

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
or is it wetland species because this is

78
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
likely a wet soil

79
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,080
it might be poor for cannabis production

80
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
any inconsistencies do you notice are

81
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
there empty pockets within the soil

82
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,520
it could be since prior usage could be

83
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
spills in an area

84
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,680
or sometimes those empty spots are rocks

85
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,319
or you see a lot of rocks kind of on the

86
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,159
side or

87
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,598
even within the field because this could

88
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,919
make cultivation quite

89
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,518
a challenge so you're going through a

90
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,439
physical evaluation

91
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,360
of the area so what's the topography

92
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,439
like is it very hilly

93
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,720
because that could be a sign of possible

94
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,318
soil erosion

95
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,080
do you notice any rocks you know do you

96
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,598
notice any large rocks because

97
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
cultivation could be a challenge for

98
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,159
weed control or even just initial

99
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,159
planting

100
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,318
also do you know what the soil type is

101
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,799
how well will allow root aeration

102
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,439
to occur and is there any ponding that

103
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
you notice

104
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,400
in any areas a poor drainage can be a

105
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,119
continual challenge and result in plant

106
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
stunting

107
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,519
clearly as we see here in this field now

108
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,158
if it's one little pocket one little

109
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
area

110
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,919
no problem but if you see a lot of this

111
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,119
occurring that could be a red's flag

112
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,559
there

113
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,439
also then we get into the chemical

114
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,080
evaluation so taking a soil test of the

115
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,759
field

116
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
what does the soil test say you know

117
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,719
looking at after we pass all the other

118
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,439
kind of steps

119
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,560
what take a soil test great to do as

120
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,479
you're also doing the visual

121
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,479
inspection this would be advised to get

122
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,719
a full soil test done that looks

123
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,479
for far more than just nutrients what

124
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,759
are you interested in the soil test on

125
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,318
this potential field

126
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,679
well consider the ph what's the organic

127
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,839
matter soluble salts

128
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
particle distribution and possible

129
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,479
contaminants such as

130
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,878
lead and aluminum for sure is what i'd

131
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,359
be checking in many labs perform those

132
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,598
tests

133
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
normally so just a good idea to get a

134
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,158
good evaluation of the soil

135
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,759
good chemical evaluation to have an idea

136
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,079
of while it may look good

137
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,959
what does the kind of chemical profile

138
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
that soil tests

139
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,560
suggest because it also gets into well

140
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,119
what amendments

141
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
might be looking at adding let me get

142
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
into lastly here the regulatory

143
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,759
evaluation

144
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
and even if a field completely checks

145
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,719
out growers should look into specific

146
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
town regulations

147
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
this can be highly variable from one

148
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
town to the next

149
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,840
so questions you should ask can you

150
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,439
build a structure good for cold frame

151
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,239
construction especially for early season

152
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,639
propagation

153
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
something to consider any setbacks for

154
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,600
cannabis production so sometimes there

155
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,478
are road or neighbor setback

156
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,439
requirements

157
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,240
how far do you need to be from other

158
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,079
areas

159
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
so there's also some distances greater

160
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,800
for public property such as a school if

161
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,879
that's nearby

162
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
something else to be considering looking

163
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,399
at those zoning regulations

164
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,759
and then fencing or signage requirements

165
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,399
does your town require a physical

166
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,720
barrier

167
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,719
or is signage required if so what must

168
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,639
state how large does it need to be

169
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
and you know just be aware of all these

170
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,840
things ahead of time

171
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
because it's one thing it's going to be

172
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,560
a lot of work to kind of go through and

173
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,319
purchase an area

174
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
or rent an area but you want to make

175
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,038
sure that it all checks out at least

176
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
from all these kind of

177
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,159
evaluation standpoints so you can try to

178
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,079
focus

179
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,039
on the actual growing aspect you don't

180
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,959
have to worry about any of these

181
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,959
potential barriers preventing you

182
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,959
from doing what you planned originally

183
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,959
on doing for your cannabis production
