1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
here we look at the biological species

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,349
concept so how do we get a group of

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,990
individuals that's a subset of an

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,968
original population and why is that

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,699
advantageous I'll go over some of the

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,948
reasons of why this occurs so the start

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,129
speciation is the process of species

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,010
forming process it involves progressive

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:25,768
change and localized populations become

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,929
increasingly specialized natural

11
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,788
selection acts to keep them at different

12
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,340
enough so we kind of get this splitting

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,070
effect that occurs now biological

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,859
species concept is defined as species

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,280
are groups of actually or potentially

16
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,049
interbreeding natural populations which

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,870
are reproductively isolated from one

18
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:48,328
another other such groups so kind of

19
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,169
getting this separation that occurs and

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,628
this can happen in two different forms

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,149
so it is a two-part process that causes

22
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,729
this initially to occur one identical

23
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,920
populations must diverge and to

24
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,618
reproductive isolation must evolve to

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,450
maintain these differences speciation

26
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,430
occurs quicker in the absence of gene

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,950
claw this is much more likely in

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,920
geographically isolated populations so

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,519
here we have our formation of locusts

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,710
hybrids

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,349
we have selection against those hybrids

32
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:23,039
and over time we get a clear and

33
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,809
distinctive green in blue population so

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,689
this hybrid this intermediate was just

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,820
not fit for the particular environmental

36
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,609
conditions and our speciation occurred

37
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:36,779
causing a distinctive green in blue

38
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:38,368
species to develop so there's two types

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,790
here in this pictures a great way to

40
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:44,790
visualize them allopatric speciation

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,790
which is the differentiation of

42
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,700
geological geographically isolated

43
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,439
populations into distinctive species we

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,509
have a population here put that into a

45
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,389
picture we have a mountain region that's

46
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,968
separated out we see here geographically

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,329
isolated we have our darker colored

48
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:04,978
green and in our layer color green

49
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:07,408
sympatric speciation is the

50
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,258
differentiation of populations within a

51
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,840
common geographical area in two distinct

52
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,389
species so this is a reproductive

53
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,599
isolation as a

54
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:19,250
you see in the middle region here

55
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,109
presents our greater number of lighter

56
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,150
green trees than the darker greens on

57
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,520
the outside and this is a reproductive

58
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,390
isolation that's occurring the through

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,530
these sympatric speciation so types of

60
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:35,869
speciation auto polyploidy instantaneous

61
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,818
synthetic speciation may occur through

62
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,700
collie protein which is more than two

63
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:42,560
sets of chromosomes Auto polyploidy are

64
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:45,049
all the chromosomes are from one species

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,430
this occurs when an individual has more

66
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,920
than two sets of chromosomes which

67
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,890
before and all derived from the original

68
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,859
species would be normal diploid or 2n so

69
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:57,738
Viktor word apart Otto polyploid itself

70
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,739
many folder chromosomes how does this

71
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,959
occur well so failure in meiosis causes

72
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:04,640
the chromosomes to fail to separate so

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,950
you're getting this kind of foreign or

74
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,458
tetraploid I mean this isn't always a

75
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:13,159
good thing to happen but in certain

76
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,009
instances plants in particular autoplay

77
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,909
can occur this is a type of speciation

78
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:21,709
as I go is tetraploid II or basically 4n

79
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:26,000
instead of the original diploid which

80
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:27,979
would be two men the other type is all

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,079
of polyploidy which is chromosomes

82
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,899
derived from two species via

83
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:35,209
hybridization this in particular is much

84
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,560
more common in plants and animals and

85
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,590
this occurs when two different species

86
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,569
contribute to the polyploidy hybrid so

87
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,769
inter pacific hybrids hybrids great from

88
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,639
two different species are usually

89
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,650
sterile

90
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,399
however the hybrids are usually very

91
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:52,250
vigorous so how does this apply well

92
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,579
getting common polyploid ease oats

93
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,400
cotton potatoes tobacco wheat crops

94
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,409
typically fall into this category where

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,719
we're looking at producing increased

96
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:04,449
yields and because they're sterile

97
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,769
sometimes these individuals may produce

98
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:08,780
reduced or no seeds which is

99
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,879
advantageous for the customer so now

100
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,609
there's the farmer getting larger and

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,829
more consistent crops but the offspring

102
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,900
being produced might be more favourable

103
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:22,030
to the people buying it you're just some

104
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,029
examples of biological speciation
