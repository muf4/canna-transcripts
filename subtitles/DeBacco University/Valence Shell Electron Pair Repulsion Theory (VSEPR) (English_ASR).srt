1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
okay here we're gonna look at the

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:06,960
valence shell electron pair repulsion

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,399
theory or Vesper which I know is a

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
mouthful but we can kind of break it

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,330
apart and understand at least two pieces

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,460
valence shell electron there's the

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,948
electrons in the outermost shell pairs

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,410
to repulsion theory

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,050
so because electrons have negative

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,028
charges two negative charges want to

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,859
repel one another so this is kind of

12
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,198
taking on the particular shape that

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,510
we're gonna see and for the purpose of

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,950
this video lecture we're looking at can

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,820
you identify certain shapes of molecules

16
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,219
so the valence shell electron pair

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,689
repulsion theory or Vesper assumes that

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,460
a molecule will form a structure that

19
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,709
will minimize the repulsion between the

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,799
islands electrons it's also known as the

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,329
ax II notation ACN for the central atom

22
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,718
X for the terminal atoms

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,160
efore the free electron pairs and what

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,609
we try to depict here is when there's a

25
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,799
line that's in the same plane when we

26
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,558
see the black kind of triangle that is

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,659
kind of like coming towards us and when

28
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,959
we see the dots that's going away from

29
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:08,519
us here another YouTube video if you

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,259
want to check it out I hear from a

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,560
different perspective who all check that

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,850
one out also so getting into it why is

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,790
this important why he didn't understand

34
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,919
shape well molecular shape is function

35
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,650
are very important well molecule shape

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,299
is very important to its function

37
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,850
biological molecules recognize and

38
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,909
interact with each other with

39
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:30,929
specificity based on the molecular shape

40
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,359
molecules with similar shapes can have

41
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,040
similar biological effects and just I

42
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,150
did the example here of hemoglobin and

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,950
chlorophyll we kind of look at them

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,210
quick they look very similar in

45
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,880
hemoglobin is going to be in red blood

46
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:44,639
cells chlorophyll in plants when we

47
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,129
study bones how they kind of have a lot

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,228
of similar shape and function here we

49
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:51,810
see humans the dog the bird in the whale

50
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:55,200
how these particular bones may have some

51
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,609
other functions for us so the five basic

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,430
structure that were getting to them in

53
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:02,250
detail I presented them here ones linear

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,390
trigonal planar tetrahedral trigonal

55
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,879
bipyramid

56
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,769
and octahedron so let's get into it here

57
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,258
so what's the most basic a linear

58
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,419
molecule linear molecule has bonding or

59
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,739
build 180 degrees apart producing a

60
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,769
molecule of linear

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,500
geometry so if I gave you a picture of

62
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,939
this could you identify this as a linear

63
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,960
molecules when it builds before this

64
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,539
example is just carbon dioxide co2

65
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,540
another example here trigonal planar so

66
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,879
one atom at the central at the center in

67
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,889
three atoms at the corners of an

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,900
equilateral triangle so once you

69
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,179
understand for this one trigonal planar

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,250
there's three here forming a triangle

71
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,409
all on the same plane

72
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,849
it's on the same plane there so it's

73
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,889
trigonal there's three of them and

74
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,530
they're all in the same plane so that is

75
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,469
a way you can easily identify in a

76
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,629
recognized molecule Bishop boron

77
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,009
tetrafluoride is an example I'm more

78
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,099
concerned you can recognize the shape

79
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,709
identify it moving on

80
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,109
tetrahedral so a tetrahedral molecular

81
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,990
geometry is a central atom located

82
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,490
Center with four substituents that are

83
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,150
located at the corners of the

84
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,909
tetrahedron

85
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,719
so this tetrahedral tetra meaning four

86
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:19,259
well if we count on 1 2 3 4 which four

87
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,389
here vining zina and tetra oxide here so

88
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:26,099
this is an example of a tetrahedral

89
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:28,889
molecule moving on trigonal bipyramid

90
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,859
so trigonal bipyramid has an one atom at

91
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:35,519
the center in five more atoms the

92
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,350
corners of the trigonal pyramid so this

93
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,870
needs a little convenient trigonal if we

94
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:43,319
remember trigonal planar here's our 3 in

95
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,230
the same plane my pyramid this forms a

96
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,819
pyramid we pyramid one and then this

97
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:50,489
forms a pyramid that can be pyramid two

98
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,000
so these are two pyramids and here's our

99
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,950
trigonal planar area here so the proper

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,849
term for this molecule phosphorus

101
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,839
pentachloride

102
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:03,180
trigonal bipyramid the last one here

103
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,740
octahedral so an octahedral molecular

104
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,750
geometry describes the shapes of

105
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,879
components with six atoms or groups of

106
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,189
an atom or ligands symmetrically

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,620
arranged around a central atom defining

108
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,520
the vertices of an octahedron what the

109
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,199
heck does that mean

110
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,000
well let's break that down as an easy

111
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,389
way to recognize it sulfur hexafluoride

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,569
is an example octahedral look there's

113
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,860
one two three four five there's six

114
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:27,569
binding points the only one with six

115
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,870
points here

116
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:32,610
that would be an octahedral molecule so

117
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,009
again for purposes of this I just want

118
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,389
to identify this shape with the name and

119
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,159
not go any further

120
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,319
you get into chemistry I'll get into

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,840
this in more detail but for right now I

122
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,980
show you a shape of a molecule can you

123
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,979
properly describe it
