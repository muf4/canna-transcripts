1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
we're going to be covering the eurasian

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,359
hemp or

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:16,879
proper identification and control as it

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:19,039
relates to cannabis

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,879
so here we can see pictures of the same

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
plant here when cut away

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,480
clearly there is an insect in there this

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,479
is identified as the eurasian

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
hemp borer and we're going to go through

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,960
how to properly identify it in a plant

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,520
and also how to go about controlling it

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,439
so first off just a general description

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,440
the asian hemp oil can have negative

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,000
impacts on cannabis plants

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,079
document is documented as an economic

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
importance for fiber production

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,920
economic threshold is 10 larvae per

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,159
plant due to reduction in plant growth

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640
and seed production and seeds the

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,398
problem is that it borrows into the stem

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,759
so here is a cutaway of the stem we

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,520
could see definitely a

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,960
necrotic region here blackened region

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,239
that's where probably entered is eating

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
away at the stem

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,358
the base of a bud here but it is

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
internal

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,439
so how do we go about identifying uh the

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
eurasian hemp or

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,478
and we could see here just some of the

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,879
adult

33
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,000
eurasian hemp or moths we also see the

34
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,959
pupa evident

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,719
here so when we're going through and

36
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,438
identifying or proper identification of

37
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,118
the bore

38
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,559
it has a distinctive characteristics

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,438
there's a pinkish

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,118
whitish pale brown a larvae with several

41
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,199
uh barely visible pale

42
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,599
bristles at the body segments the asian

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,439
temple are small 78 millimeters compared

44
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,599
to the corn earring which is much larger

45
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,679
so you don't want to confuse the two

46
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,359
uh earlier larva and stars are difficult

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799
to distinguish from the background as

48
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,159
they're whitish and cream colored as we

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,600
saw on that first image

50
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,200
may have two to three generations in the

51
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,919
southern united states so be aware of

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
that

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
the head is a yellowish to brown

54
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,640
coloration and can be dark to

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,920
black it does have light detecting very

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
simple eyes

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
the late larval instar in the fall is

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
the overwintering stage and can have an

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,118
orange to reddish coloration kind of as

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
we see down here

61
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,359
this stage passes the winter in well

62
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,920
sheltered places such as folded leaves

63
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,319
or

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,479
tunnels tunneled into stems the telling

65
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,919
may cause some stunting and distortion

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
of the stems and stalks

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,919
the adults merge during the spring after

68
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,598
mating and they start to lay eggs

69
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,439
in the absence of hemp they can feed on

70
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,479
hops and knotweed and probably other

71
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,400
weeds as well

72
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,159
adults are small moths as we see right

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,039
here displaying white stripes

74
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,598
in the front edges and four chevron-like

75
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,639
stripes

76
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,318
near the center when they'll expand it

77
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,598
now the adult this kind of shows that

78
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,878
kind of a little bit more zoomed in

79
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,399
version of the adult

80
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,639
they are commonly spread to new

81
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
locations via infested hemp seeds or

82
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,839
debris

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,360
the cultivar selection may be important

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
wild hemp in vermont seems to have

85
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
innate resistance to the pest compared

86
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
to that wild hemp in the midwest united

87
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,759
states

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,080
that's kind of an interesting discovery

89
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,318
there at least initially

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
now what to look for on the actual

91
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,079
plants is the larva

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
of the infested moth borrows into the

93
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
stem of the hemp plants making tunnels

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
so while it looks like we have some

95
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
wilting going on here and some browning

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,400
it's really that

97
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,400
internal portion that is of concern they

98
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
can also feed on the leaves and later in

99
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,599
the season attack

100
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,720
seeds as well as flowers so if you see

101
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,318
this die back

102
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,840
go through and investigate the stem you

103
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,799
might have to do a little cutaway and

104
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,360
you might find

105
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,239
one of these hemp boards so to go about

106
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,319
managing

107
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,840
the hemp or well the first step should

108
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,958
be cleaning pruning and disposing of

109
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
infested plants

110
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
remember this insect lives in the stems

111
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,920
this is of increased importance if

112
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,639
cannabis will be grown in the same

113
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,280
location

114
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,798
the following year removal of wild weeds

115
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
is also recommended to eliminate

116
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
alternate hosts

117
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
insecticide application effectiveness is

118
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,439
reduced to the fact that the immature

119
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,360
stages live inside the stems

120
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,878
very difficult to control them there

121
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,799
systemic products are often not

122
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,318
registered or recommended

123
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
and that's what it would take to get to

124
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,238
the actual location

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,919
where this templar is located so this

126
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
gives you some good information there

127
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,000
hopefully you don't see it but if you do

128
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,000
you're able to properly identify and

129
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
start to implement control measures
