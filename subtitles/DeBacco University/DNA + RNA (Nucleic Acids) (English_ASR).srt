1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
okay here we're a look at the

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,690
macromolecule nucleic acids keep in mind

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,500
that this nucleic acid category is made

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,570
up of both DNA and also RNA we see DNA

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,218
depicted here on the right and aren't

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,870
affected here on the left we're gonna go

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:19,039
into a little bit of detail at how

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:22,679
you'll be able to distinguish these two

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,240
different types of nucleic acids so

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,489
starting off nucleic acids in general

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,409
the main function is to store genetic

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,149
information it's in the genes

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,859
it's a blueprint for the building of

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:37,829
proteins DNA will be transcribed into

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,689
RNA which is then translated into amino

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,239
acid sequence which will ultimately make

17
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,030
a protein this is responsible for

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,859
transfer of information it's a blueprint

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,649
for new cells and a blueprint for the

20
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:53,100
next generation see here are two parents

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,219
passing down offspring and the DNA or

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,140
the nucleic acids here will allow that

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,850
to be the blueprint for the next

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,850
generation to see certain traits certain

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,570
genes being passed on from the parents

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,810
to the offspring now on nucleic acids

27
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,548
here dNA stands for deoxyribonucleic

28
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,850
acid it's a double helix structure and

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,970
its structure was first proposed in 1953

30
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,188
about watson and crick RNA is a

31
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,920
ribonucleic acid it's a single helix

32
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:24,688
Lucy there's kind of one strand here now

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,189
both of these nucleic acids they're

34
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,559
monomers or what's the building block

35
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:31,078
for these in this case it's nucleotides

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,740
that's the building block for nucleic

37
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:37,139
acids here's a nice comparison between

38
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,719
our RNA and our DNA remember RNA is

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,618
ribonucleic acid DNA is deoxyribonucleic

40
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,688
acid sugar is ribose so we say ribose

41
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:49,560
and deoxyribose here that means without

42
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:52,618
oxygen for DNA and the sugar ribose here

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,939
has that oxygen built got into it the

44
00:01:52,618 --> 00:02:00,299
bases are a GC in you for RNA and a GC

45
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:03,139
in T for DNA so what does this letter

46
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,118
stand for well that's adenine guanine

47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,449
cytosine and uracil and I have that one

48
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:12,180
in blue cuz that's unique to RNA for DNA

49
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,009
we still had name guanine cytosine B

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,730
with thymine

51
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:19,560
and that's unique to DNA in addition

52
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,018
looking at these two structures we see

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,658
for the most part RNA is going to be

54
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,629
single-stranded for our purposes and DNA

55
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:29,579
is double-stranded so that's another one

56
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:30,989
you can't tell them apart key part here

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,799
if we look at our monomer unit our

58
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,750
nucleotides

59
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:36,060
your cell that immediately indicates its

60
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,389
RNA when we see thymine immediately

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,920
indicates that its DNA the distribution

62
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,408
of these nucleic acids in eukaryotic

63
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,750
cells well DNA is found in the nucleus

64
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:48,179
with small amounts in the manic Andreea

65
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,370
and also in chloroplasts if you're a

66
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,230
plant cell you have DNA in the nucleus

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,120
in a mitochondrion also in the

68
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,818
chloroplast animal cells we'll have it

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,319
in nucleus in the mitochondria in

70
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,358
contrast that RNA is actually found

71
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,039
throughout the cell so it's a plant cell

72
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:06,120
or an animal cells found throughout the

73
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,919
cell so RNA single-stranded basically

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,659
for our purposes or some cases we're

75
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,518
just double stranded and we should have

76
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,560
the big circle with the extra here as we

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,510
know Steinman is located so we can

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,379
clearly indicate that this is DNA in

79
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:21,060
that RNA seeing the presence here of

80
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:24,239
uracil up in this corner we see that

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,750
that is a characteristic that only RNA

82
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,969
has I mentioned for our purposes are

83
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,259
enabled be single-stranded keep in mind

84
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,400
that some viruses are actually

85
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,310
double-stranded it seems for

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,680
double-stranded RNA so it does exist

87
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,299
we're just merely going to look at it as

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,950
RNA being single-stranded commonality

89
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,230
between RNA and DNA

90
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,659
they're both negatively charged this

91
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:51,030
process allows gel electrophoresis to

92
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,159
separate DNA segments we'll do more

93
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,750
about this in the biotechnology lecture

94
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,969
series but what this basically means if

95
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,568
we apply a charge we have a positive

96
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,269
charge here

97
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,918
because DNA and RNA are both negatively

98
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,409
charged we'll be drawn to the positive

99
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,410
charge which allows us to separate out

100
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:09,120
fragments of these nucleic acids well

101
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,918
understand more in biotechnology why

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,239
that's important but for right now just

103
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,189
realize that they do have a negative

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,199
charge because of their backbone and

105
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,608
that allows them to be separated here

106
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,620
through the process electrophoresis

107
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,608
which is involving a difference in

108
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,608
charge and voltage
