1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
okay here we're looking at a memory

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,929
challenge or just memory in general so

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,730
this is important to kind of recognize

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,650
your own limitations as well if you're

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,419
interviewing someone there are potential

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,630
limitations that they may have to

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,490
recount the scene or remember an event

8
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,320
also remember the duration of time that

9
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,669
the event may have occurred or other

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,528
conditions whether it was during the day

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,960
or at night that can also impact

12
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,149
people's ability of remember things or

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
just what they can see in general so

14
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,659
looking at memory there's different

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,939
types of memory so the sensory memory is

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,950
one type this is the shortest term

17
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,869
element of memory and its ability to

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,910
maintain impressions of sensory

19
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,039
information after the original stimuli

20
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,779
have ended this is why it's important if

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,210
you see something you try to write down

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,149
as many details as you can as soon after

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,549
it occurs as possible so you're able to

24
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,489
kind of recount what happened what

25
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:55,619
occurred if you can add timestamps to it

26
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,869
that's all the better but just kind of

27
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,448
this is that first shortest term element

28
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,578
of memory what was going on around it

29
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,890
and that leads us to working memory

30
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,450
which has a limited capacity that is

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,420
concerned with the immediate conscious

32
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,728
person perceptual and linguistic

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,170
processing working memory is important

34
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,140
for reasoning and guidance of

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,728
decision-making in behavior this can

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,009
kind of be sometimes considered to be

37
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,650
kind of in the moment we're looking at

38
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,500
making the decision do you go left you

39
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,790
go right do you FLE do you stay what do

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,469
you do is kind of part of that working

41
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,790
memory so limited capacity you can sort

42
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,039
of think of immediate conscious of

43
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,829
what's going in in a round of the

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,299
individual unless I'm going to cover

45
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,219
here is long-term memories it kind of

46
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,079
would apply it's a short-term it's a

47
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,368
long-term memory compared to our

48
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,589
short-term memory which kind of just

49
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,540
discussed previously here long-term

50
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,040
memories the types of memory responsible

51
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,140
for the storage of information for an

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,899
extended period of time this might be

53
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,879
more limiting on the total amount of

54
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,228
detail that can be provided but the

55
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,578
extended period of time this is

56
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,500
something that if a crime occurred a

57
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,809
long time ago this is kind of what

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,409
should be depending on that witness to

59
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,820
be able to provide or recount it for you

60
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:09,149
so tips for improving memory just in

61
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:11,549
general get active and be creative to

62
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,140
kind of help keep the brain working try

63
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,590
to teach someone something kind of like

64
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,109
what I'm doing

65
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,610
right now test yourself on multiple

66
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,500
occasions in multiple ways and it's

67
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,239
going to be you know just challenging

68
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,789
yourself in general practice and repeat

69
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,259
processes and get enough sleep so all

70
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,090
these things kind of can go through and

71
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,439
improve your memory if you think your

72
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,450
memories you know pretty good as it is

73
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,609
just a question for you can remember

74
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:34,768
anything about the image on the title

75
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,180
slide into there were two children do

76
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,530
you know anything or you describe

77
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,439
anything about what's going on in the

78
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,439
picture or for example can you describe

79
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,150
the shirts that they were wearing if not

80
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,039
go back to the title slide take a look

81
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,340
and keep working on improving your

82
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,340
memory
