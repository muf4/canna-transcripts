1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,490
in this video we're gonna look at seed

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,069
plants or plants that produce seeds and

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,750
I gave two representative samples here

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,639
it doesn't mean you just name only two

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,629
in this case this be the dandelion and

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:19,259
the pine tree so the evolution of seed

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,570
plants the seed is a critical adaptation

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,820
to life on land because it protects the

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,910
embryonic plant when it is at its most

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,740
vulnerable stage of its life seed has

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,170
produced two kinds of community it's

12
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,869
male and female which develop completely

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,640
within the sporophyte the milk

14
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,189
gametophyte is called the pollen grains

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,950
and this gives rise to the microspores

16
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:44,250
the female criminal fight contains the

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,250
egg within the ovule and this develops

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,988
into the megaspore kind of a way to try

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,119
to remember this is you think it's like

20
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,538
a sperm and an egg the sperm is very

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,339
small in comparison to the egg and the

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,410
sperm in this case represents the pollen

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,570
and that's the male portion that's a

24
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,608
very small region and the egg or the

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,900
ovules the metaphor here it's much

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,579
larger in comparison in size so

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,140
evolution of seed plants all same plants

28
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,569
are derived from a single common

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,180
ancestor and there's two main branch

30
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:18,539
points here we have gymnosperms and

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,159
angiosperms so gymnosperms the ovules

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,930
are not completely enclosed by the

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,049
sporophyte tissue at the time of

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,640
pollination sig evident by our pinecone

35
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:34,049
here microscopic female gametophyte n is

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,180
inside the ovulate cone and microscopic

37
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,460
male gametophyte n inside the pollen

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,950
cone here also so you see if you look

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,649
very carefully pine trees they yes they

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,799
have the cones they also produce these

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,469
male microspores here which is

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,509
containing the pollen angiosperms the

43
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,810
other case here are ones that produce

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,819
flowers they most recently evolved the

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,340
ovules are completely enclosed in the

46
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,798
sporophyte tissue called the carpel and

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,240
this is at the time of pollination and

48
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,329
they're the ones producing the true

49
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,128
flowers here microscopic female

50
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:10,469
gametophyte and inside the parts of the

51
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,929
flower and the microscopic male can we

52
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,340
fight inside these flower parts here

53
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,060
and it's this again the sporophyte the

54
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,299
2n and the pollen in is the end along

55
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,189
with the egg so what does the see the

56
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:27,810
evolution of the seed see has three

57
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:29,789
visible parts to it the endosperm is a

58
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,219
source of food that developed that the

59
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:34,139
developing embryo needs in some sense

60
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,269
the endosperm is used up by the embryo

61
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,699
and stored as food in structures called

62
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:42,269
cotyledons we're going to talk about

63
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:44,609
monocots and dicots dicot meaning dye

64
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:48,120
meaning to there's basically two seed

65
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,280
leaves monocot meaning one series the

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,530
embryo is the simple small little plant

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,329
lip and that's just kind of what's gonna

68
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,939
house the genetic information that's

69
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,260
going to develop into the full size plan

70
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:00,389
and the coat is a drought resistance

71
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,429
protective layer that's the outside here

72
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,949
so we see the comparison between a bean

73
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,079
seed in the corn seed and I'll have

74
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,848
another video that describes monocots

75
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,290
and dicots will be able to further

76
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:12,090
understand the difference between the

77
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,378
two but right now just looking at the

78
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,900
seeds you see they have a lot of the

79
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,659
same parts the key difference here is

80
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,760
the cotyledon we have cuddling here

81
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,680
putting the two binning dicots to seed

82
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,429
leaves in this being seen and the

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,680
cuddling in the corn is only one so

84
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,719
benefits of seeds will seeds out for a

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,180
lot of benefits the plants dispersal is

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,489
one facilitates the migration to new

87
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,579
habitats see here by the wind carrying

88
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,950
new seeds of vanillin dormancy this

89
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,849
permits plants have delayed the

90
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,888
development until conditions are

91
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:46,709
favorable plant doesn't necessarily

92
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,150
germinate in the fall it's not going to

93
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,180
be able to tolerate the harsh winter

94
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,230
particularly here in New England

95
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,909
germination controls when the plant

96
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,738
develops so that it can be synchronized

97
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,198
with critical aspects and the plants

98
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,299
habitat clearance might want to time the

99
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,310
germination and the lay their dormant

100
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,489
say so once most favourable for them to

101
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,680
actually grow in nourishment seeds

102
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,269
provide nourishment of the young plant

103
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,030
during the critical period just after

104
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,609
germination as we see here so relating

105
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,108
to drumming and germination this young

106
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:19,259
seedling here may want to wait till this

107
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,120
spring when the larger trees in shade

108
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,610
that it might be around it aren't fully

109
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,468
developed yet it is getting some

110
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,759
nutrients here to allow it to fully

111
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:29,430
expand its leaves

112
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:33,599
before it starts making its own sugars

113
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,370
from the Sun improve seed dispersal is

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,020
fruits fruits are a great way plants

115
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,629
have developed to be able to disperse

116
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,490
their seeds mature ovaries surrounds the

117
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:43,680
ovule becomes all or part of the fruit

118
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,079
in our angiosperms again our flower

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,480
producing plans they use fruits to

120
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,550
induce animals to disperse the seeds

121
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,900
although eaten by animals the seats

122
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,210
within the fruit are resistance -

123
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,889
chewing and digestion they passed out of

124
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,019
the animal in the feces ready to

125
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,810
germinate at a new location far from the

126
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,089
plant this is why typically farmers may

127
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,800
add manure to their fields because it

128
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:06,629
helps plants grow this could be a

129
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,579
potential reason why that occurs is

130
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,829
polenta used to be able to pass through

131
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,120
the digestive system and then grow in

132
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:14,370
the fertile manure

133
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,340
some fruits are dispersed by wind or

134
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,500
water see here the coconut water and our

135
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,409
data line again by wind but just because

136
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,850
a bird comes through and picks up a very

137
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,040
here doesn't mean it's a bad thing for

138
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,830
the plant it's being dispersed to

139
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,450
different regions us watermelons may

140
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,519
take them to picnics and the monkeys and

141
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:36,060
the squirrels here ways to disperse

142
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:38,729
things also the seeds can kind of attach

143
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,920
themselves in this case physically to

144
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,530
clothing or other animals through these

145
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,960
birds may be dispersed that way all

146
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,269
these are ways that plants have evolved

147
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,750
to help increase their ability to

148
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:55,549
disperse their seeds and take over and

149
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,550
be introduced to new locations
