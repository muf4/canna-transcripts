1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,619
okay here I'm gonna investigate the

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,700
plant hormone salicylic acid and if

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,519
you're wondering that this name sounds a

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,800
little familiar is a very similar to the

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,719
compound found in aspirin this is where

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,639
the rumors or focal airs come up with if

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,230
you add an aspirin to your watering can

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,820
when you go and water your plant how

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,519
that could be beneficial for that plant

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,850
that stems from this particular plant

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,129
hormone so salicylic acid impacts plant

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,570
growth in development the photosynthetic

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,239
pathway transpiration

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,189
I am uptake and transport so there's one

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,710
little hormone can involved as a lot of

16
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,230
plant processes involved in signaling

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,960
immediate planted defenses against

18
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:42,179
pathogens so these are all impacts at

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,789
this one single hormone can have on

20
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,769
plant growth now plays roles and

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,500
resistance to pathogens as well missus

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,960
where that benefit comes in that's

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,628
involved in the systemic acquired

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,549
resistance which pathogen attack on one

25
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,039
part of the plant induces resistance in

26
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,019
other parts so what does this mean well

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,510
this is involving if there's one area

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,760
that's seeing a point of infection this

29
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,048
hormone can be activated sent to other

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,990
parts of the plant to kind of up

31
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,150
regulate the defenses to help we make

32
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,099
the other plant more resistant to a

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,960
particular pathogen so that pathogen

34
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,539
having to infect different areas of the

35
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,429
plant having in one area up regulating

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,618
this particular hormone that signal can

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,930
be passed to the plant to make it better

38
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,728
to defend itself against that pathogen

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,430
exhibited one part odds are it's going

40
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,379
to want to spread to others now not only

41
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,909
can the silk signal impact the original

42
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:34,560
plant that becomes infected and that

43
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,299
includes different parts of that plant

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
the signal can also moved to nearby

45
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,020
plants this happens when a plant

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,118
converts the salicylic acid to volatile

47
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:45,118
compounds so it releases like a mist

48
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,790
year in the air so this is a great

49
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,438
advantage not to plants because if

50
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,600
there's one point in infection this is

51
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,548
one way one individual plant can get the

52
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,530
signal out to its neighbors that there's

53
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,630
a pathogen under attack hopefully

54
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,609
operating up regulating their defense

55
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,798
mechanisms to reduce the impact that

56
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,540
pathogen can have family on the original

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,670
plant that it infected but the

58
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,670
surrounding plants in that area
