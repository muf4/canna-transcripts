1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,880
in this video at debacle university we'd

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,480
be investigating crime scene questions

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,240
kind of the what the who the where the

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,120
when the how and the why

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,960
involved with crime scenes well starting

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,678
with who did it you know that first and

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
initial

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,118
uh some people consider the most

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,600
important question but we want to

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,320
be mindful that there's could be one

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
person

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,000
or there could be multiple people

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,519
involved when we're considering who did

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,879
it we may also want to consider who may

15
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,839
have a motive to commit such a crime

16
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,359
we get into well what happened so do not

17
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,640
make assumptions and this is kind of

18
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,960
easier said than done

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,719
sometimes items may be rearranged to try

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
to provide a misdirection for the

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
investigator

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,280
so it's important to be looking at the

23
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,359
details and not make assumptions

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,079
when trying to answer what may have

25
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:51,039
happened at the particular crime scene

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,558
then where did it happen so in this here

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,000
or is there another location that might

28
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,759
be involved just because you're

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,719
identifying something at one particular

30
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,878
location

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,558
there could be another one involved the

32
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,079
actual act may have occurred in one

33
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,759
area and then there could have been the

34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
transportation of the body for example

35
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,438
to another physical location

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,840
so where did it happen may not

37
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,719
necessarily be the exact location where

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,560
the body is found then when did it

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,478
happen so that all important time

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,719
factor knowing the time of death can

41
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,560
help try to pinpoint the details

42
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,158
of the critical one to two hour time

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,920
frame before death

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,359
so this is kind of that crucial time

45
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,799
that one or two hours what can be

46
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,799
established how much details can be

47
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
gotten about that particular time

48
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,880
just before death can really help

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,840
explain or provide

50
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,879
some great information regarding to the

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
crime scene that

52
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,959
they're investigating and then how did

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,200
it happen

54
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,438
so what specific items were used in the

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
scene sometimes a knife may seem obvious

56
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,679
but

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
less likely items can be used such as a

58
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
golf club or extension cord

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000
or something that may have been just

60
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,679
lying around the house depending on the

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
act that was created so don't think it's

62
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
always uh the knife i'm looking for

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,280
a gun i'm looking for something like

64
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,239
that it could be simple household items

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,519
can become very vital evidence in crime

66
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,280
scenes

67
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,280
and then why did it happen so this can

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,038
often be a perplexing question

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,719
getting at the motive is not always the

70
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,479
main goal but this can play into the

71
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,680
recreation of the scene

72
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,119
was there an argument before the murder

73
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
had occurred for example

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
is there potential financial incentives

75
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,079
for one individual to help

76
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,439
explain potentially why did such a crime

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,719
happen

78
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,400
then who was or were the victims so in

79
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,239
this example here do they

80
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
um how do they have anyone connections

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
with where were they one or two hours

82
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,399
before their death so this is kind of

83
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,159
that critical time once we

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
establish the time of death for an

85
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,639
individual try to get as much

86
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
information

87
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,079
around them in that last one to two

88
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,560
hours

89
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
because that can really help pinpoint or

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
eliminate

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
certain potential suspects when we're

92
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
looking at

93
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,840
the victim at hand and then what

94
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
evidence

95
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
is there so keep in mind that the goals

96
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,119
help to prove the motive

97
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,519
in the crime be sure to document images

98
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
and

99
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,959
sketch the scene these are important

100
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,518
aspects so we're not necessarily looking

101
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,598
at

102
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,640
documenting or making notes to answer

103
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,000
these questions

104
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,839
hopefully through our investigative

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,318
process we'll collect the data in

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
information so that as later in

107
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:20,719
investigation

108
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
looking at the crime scene these

109
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,318
questions can be answered

110
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,598
and just kind of that overall summary

111
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,639
there of you know those questions to

112
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,719
just keep in mind

113
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,238
again who did it what happened where did

114
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,519
it happen keep in mind it could be here

115
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,400
where you found the body or could be

116
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,158
another location

117
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
involved when did it happen how did it

118
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,318
happen why did it happen who

119
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,759
who were the victims and what evidence

120
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,238
is there to help prove the motive

121
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,158
of that crime all these questions should

122
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,439
hopefully be answered

123
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,679
with the proper forensics techniques and

124
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,639
crime scene analysis and evidence

125
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
collection
