1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
if you're choosing to use overhead

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,040
irrigation there's some calculations you

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,080
should be aware of

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,240
in this video here at tobacco university

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
will help you understand those

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,759
calculations better

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,920
so you can be smart with your usage of

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
your overhead irrigation equipment

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,118
[Music]

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,039
all right let's get into overhead

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,879
sprinkler irrigation calculations for

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,880
outdoor cannabis production

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,558
and here we see a nice image here of

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,479
some overhead irrigation

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,640
nice mist there in the sun creating that

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,039
nice rainbow effect

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
so before you get the calculator keep in

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,280
mind that you do need to know a couple

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,520
things

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,120
now the spacing of your lateral lines

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
the sprinkler nozzle size

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,280
and the pressure of the system being

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
operated all these basically factor into

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
these calculations

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,480
and this pressure when it's being

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,439
operated is the discharge rate of

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,519
sprinkler heads will

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,358
increase with the higher pressure and

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,559
larger nozzle size as we see some

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,559
examples here

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,319
increasing in nozzle size increases the

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,079
gallons per minute or the flow rate

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,919
and as well as the pressure if using the

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,560
same nozzle size but increasing the

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
pressure

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,719
we can see that there is an increase may

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
not be quite as great as the diameter of

38
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,200
the nozzle

39
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,798
but there is definitely a fluctuation

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
there and that will play into

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
these calculations so the application

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,159
rate

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
uh calculation here how do we go about

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,759
this well when we're looking at the

45
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,158
sprinkler application rate inches per

46
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
hour

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
equals the discharge rate in gallons per

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,879
minute times 96.3

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,799
divided by the lateral spacing in feet

50
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,319
times the head spacing in feet

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,320
so what does this kind of all correlate

52
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,039
and mean well we have a nice little kind

53
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,039
of

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360
example kind of chart here but the

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,920
equipment used in this example

56
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:51,200
is a rain bird 20 jh with a 764 inch

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,478
nozzle the operating pressure 45 psi

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
the lateral spacing of 40 feet and then

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,679
the head spacing would be

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,599
30 feet the discharge rate from the

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,479
sprinkler head from the data table here

62
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,280
would be 2.63 gallons per minute how did

63
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,679
i get that

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,879
well knowing the diameter of the nozzle

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,239
and knowing the pressure

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,039
gets me the gallons per minute at 2.63

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,878
we take that number and we multiply it

68
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,679
by

69
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:20,159
96.3 divided by 30 feet times 40 feet

70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
and this would be giving us a coverage

71
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,639
of 0.21

72
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,639
inches per hour so this allows us to

73
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,878
calculate the application rate

74
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,679
and know what's being delivered to our

75
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,199
plants

76
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,519
sprinkler application rate inches per

77
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,119
hour in this case would be 0.21 inches

78
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,120
per hour and we can use that

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
to determine the duration that we want

80
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
to keep that sprinkler on

81
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,318
once we know how much we want to give

82
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
those plants based on the soil type

83
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,679
maybe the age of the plants

84
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,959
and also the environmental conditions as

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
well

86
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
now summary reference table so how can

87
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,759
we kind of put this together well to

88
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,719
estimate the application rate for an

89
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,799
irrigation system

90
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,080
again using the rain bird 20 jh

91
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,439
sprinkler head so we can see this

92
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
provided here

93
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,039
application rates for sprinkler systems

94
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
using these heads at varying pressures

95
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,239
nozzle sizes

96
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
and lateral and head spacing and really

97
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,200
this is just applying those

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,360
calculations here and putting into a

99
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,919
nice table now if you're not using these

100
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,599
specific

101
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,119
sprinkler heads again use these as a

102
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,039
general guide

103
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,800
and then see where how yours

104
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,120
particularly fall i'm only mentioning

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,840
this one here because it's able to find

106
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,759
this nice neat organized data table to

107
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,560
provide you with

108
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,759
now the rate determines the time so the

109
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,840
application rate can be used to

110
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,399
determine how long or the duration

111
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,239
to irrigate a crop from estimates of

112
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,158
crop water usage

113
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,959
suggested starting point is to plan for

114
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,239
one inch of water during a typical week

115
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,319
so this is kind of the starting rate for

116
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
cannabis one per water per week

117
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,238
and you can determine to increase it or

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
decrease it from that point a grower

119
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,400
with an application rate of

120
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,598
0.22 inches per hour will need to

121
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
irrigate

122
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,119
four and a half hours to get to that one

123
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
inch per week

124
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
during the week so that means your

125
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
plants should be irrigated for a

126
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,959
duration of total given this rate

127
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,238
about four and a half hours per week

128
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,438
that doesn't mean every monday they get

129
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,719
four and a half hours might want to

130
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,039
space that over the week

131
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,039
but in that seven days it should be have

132
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,400
four and a half hours of irrigation time

133
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,798
for cannabis some growers suggest

134
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,798
starting at 0.36 inches of water per day

135
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,478
but this can depend on many factors it

136
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,238
can be dependent on the soil type

137
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,758
the season the stage of plant

138
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,198
development so that needs to be taken

139
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,080
into consideration from a grower's

140
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
standpoint

141
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,359
you want to select a starting place and

142
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,560
make adjustments from there that's why i

143
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,759
recommend that one inch

144
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
you can determine how the plants are

145
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,879
doing look at the soil don't need to

146
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
irrigate a little bit more a little bit

147
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,918
less but at least that's a good stable

148
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,599
starting point

149
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,918
knowing your soil this season the plant

150
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,759
development all will play into exactly

151
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,519
what fine tuning adjustments you make

152
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
from there but at least hopefully this

153
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,639
will provide you with a starting point

154
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,680
to allow you to efficiently water the

155
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,240
plants without

156
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,918
wasting water and precious which is a

157
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
precious resource and now over

158
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,599
irrigating the plants and also not

159
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
keeping them too dry
