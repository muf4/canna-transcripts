1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
this is going to be a quick overview of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,810
the spinal cord basics keep in mind we

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,080
can't forget about how we label our

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,388
vertebrae such as cervical regions our

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,490
thoracic region our lumbar and our

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,890
pelvic because those same terms apply to

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,259
different regions in the spinal cord in

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,109
addition we have sensory or ascending

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,029
efferent pathways in blue here and those

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,699
are areas of the spinal cord that will

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,490
send a signal so we touch a hot beaker

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,320
that sense of heat and burning will go

13
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,899
is going to go through the sensory

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,880
pathway then our brain will process

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,250
information and savingly to remove our

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,109
hand from the very hot beaker and our

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,570
motor or decent and efferent pathways

18
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:45,119
indicated in red here shows where those

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,750
signals from the brain will pass through

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,070
the spinal cord continuing on with our

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,780
central nervous system looking

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,119
specifically again at the spinal cord

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,399
region well the spinal cord simply put

24
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,558
is a column of nerves from the brain to

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,679
the tailbone predicted by the vertebrae

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,328
of the spine it's responsible for the

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,680
conducting the impulses between the

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,540
brain and the rest of the body

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,220
there's impulses can come from a variety

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,618
of senses so can we hear from our skin

31
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:17,099
cater from a variety of our organs our

32
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,920
glands all these kind of feed into being

33
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,839
helping the body maintain homeostasis

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,450
and also having the body being able to

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
sense it's both external as well as its

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,368
internal environment and we see the

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,189
terms like t1 t2 that's referring to a

38
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:35,188
thoracic one thoracic to l1 refer to a

39
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,809
lumbar region what an interesting fact

40
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,849
about the nervous system in the spinal

41
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,009
cord that we talk about all these nerve

42
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:45,059
impulses moving they move very quickly

43
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,310
they actually travel at about 268 miles

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,450
per hours how quick these impulses are

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,618
being transferred so it's very quick

46
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,570
within the spinal cord there's two

47
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,049
regions there's gray matter and there's

48
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,429
white matter and the gray matter

49
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:02,670
indicated here by the yellowish region

50
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,250
is the neuron cell bodies located in the

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,189
centre the white matter and give it's

52
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,848
kind of steerage region here our axons

53
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:13,439
in dendrites on the outside you see here

54
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,919
this sectional organization of the

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,469
spinal

56
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,509
or also what a cross-section stain would

57
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,419
look like and we still see those

58
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:24,599
distinctive regions and all three of

59
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,129
these images much clearer and here even

60
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,870
in a cross-section that's been stained

61
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,519
you can clearly tell the difference

62
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,520
between gray and white matter
