1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,929
so I'm going to go over the sliding

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,389
filament theory here which is very

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:09,750
important for muscle contraction but

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:11,129
break it down into five basic steps but

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,769
first I think it's important just to

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,839
understand where God's name from well

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,980
the sliding filament on order for

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,980
muscles to contract the filaments actin

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,740
and myosin essentially slide against one

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,050
another so again we have our actin our

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,108
myosin they're sliding against one

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,600
another that's performing our contracted

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,090
phase and our when they're close

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,308
together and our relaxation phase is

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,719
when they separate that again so that's

16
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:42,000
where it gets the name from the sliding

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,399
filament theory those filaments again

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
are those actin and myosin they

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,719
themselves are not shortening in any way

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,980
they're just sliding against one another

21
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,539
so as it look so when signaled by a

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,429
motor neuron because again we're looking

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,579
at motor neurons control here and

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:58,439
skeletal muscles when we look at our

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,609
skeletal muscles look at that signal

26
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,759
from the motor neuron which I had

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,890
another independent video on that the

28
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,739
muscle fiber contracts as the thin

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,319
filaments are pulled and then slide past

30
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:13,140
the thick filaments within the fibers

31
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,449
sarcomere so we see here is our relaxed

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,118
phase if you look at the distance here

33
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,920
is greater than the distance here well

34
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,840
what's happening is our green mouse

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,790
you'll see our Athens are sliding

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
against our thicker purple molecules

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,790
here

38
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,618
Jeremias n' and that's why we see the

39
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,509
arrows pointing inward because we're

40
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,900
getting that thinning hair that

41
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,849
contracting phase so the sliding can

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,740
only occur when myosin binding sites on

43
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:40,199
the actin filaments are exposed by a

44
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:43,649
series of steps that begins with calcium

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,950
ions entry into the sacral plasm so if

46
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:51,390
we notice here look very closely there's

47
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,040
basically a space here on the contracted

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,409
phase we see that there's these small

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,810
things kind of attached those are the

50
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,299
myosin binding sites and they're exposed

51
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,759
by a series of steps and all in order

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,200
for this to occur it all has to be

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,389
initiated with calcium ions so this

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,219
muscle contraction kind of summary here

55
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,439
it's kind of that general summary this

56
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,710
cross bridge of muscle contraction will

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,419
most

58
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,510
congestion is triggered by calcium ions

59
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,729
binding to the actin active site see

60
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,289
here our tropomyosin here our myosin

61
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,929
head trying to bind our actin the

62
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,539
Purple's trying to buy into the kind of

63
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,290
the grade actin here cannot occur

64
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:33,299
Robeson is actually blocking that with

65
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:35,429
each contraction cycle actin moves

66
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,800
relative to myosin in order for it to

67
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,510
move along that that calcium purse has

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,420
to bind to this drove me get out of the

69
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:46,349
way now our myosin is binding to our

70
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:48,269
actin and that is then allowing our

71
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:51,299
heads turning instead of allowing that

72
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,490
sliding to occur it all starts with that

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,939
calcium ion to move that from out of the

74
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,409
way when the muscles relaxed the

75
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,930
attachment sites from eyes in head or

76
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,159
block try the tropomyosin so we see here

77
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,770
I've been again this is the end of the

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,199
cycle coming back around that calcium is

79
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,960
leaving provides is coming blocking that

80
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,839
- in from binding to be active in order

81
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,450
for muscle to contract tropomyosin must

82
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,539
be moved to by another protein called

83
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:21,179
troponin in this complex troponin

84
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,000
tropomyosin complex is regulated by

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,819
calcium ion concentrations in the muscle

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,650
cells so now let's look at this complex

87
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,590
in this process in a little bit more

88
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,180
detail so I want to present this is five

89
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,689
basic steps I'm going to build on each

90
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,310
other

91
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,840
so we're gonna look at the same kind of

92
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,080
diagrams and gotta build from there

93
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,210
so the first part hey we're step one the

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,760
active site on actin is exposed as

95
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:47,909
calcium which is represent here calcium

96
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,129
ions binds to troponin so we see our

97
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,500
tropomyosin and troponin here's our

98
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:56,549
calcium so the active site in actin is

99
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,289
exposed as calcium binds so this myosin

100
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,050
cannot bind to any of these regions it

101
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:02,549
has to only bind to this complex our

102
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,110
model filaments were made up of actin

103
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,390
and myosin so that's important to keep

104
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,700
in mind near in this case the green

105
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,379
circles are the actin and this image the

106
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,269
blue circles are the actin and those are

107
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,280
what we call the thin filaments may

108
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,920
consist of two chains of actin molecules

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,048
wrapped around one another myosin are

110
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,540
the thick filaments red here and the

111
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,489
purple in this image may also consist of

112
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,620
two chains wound around one another and

113
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,360
we'll look at them the next slide one

114
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,590
end consists a very long rod

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,169
while the other consists of

116
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:33,468
double-headed region called the head

117
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:35,788
region we see here that the myosin head

118
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:37,680
so the myosin head forms this cross

119
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:40,408
bridge with the actin so you can kind of

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,689
see our building here of the image the

121
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:46,408
myosin has attached to actin myosin

122
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:49,169
binds actin at at it's actin binding

123
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:50,579
site forming this cross bridge so what

124
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,978
does this cross page we'll see actual

125
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,209
binding result in here we could see this

126
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,870
cross bridge forming

127
00:04:54,209 --> 00:05:00,359
remember our red Mile field here is our

128
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,310
calcium this all initiated with calcium

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,759
and so it's allowing this binding site

130
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,430
to occur so during the power stroke the

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,669
myosin head bends in ADP and phosphate

132
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,189
not released so this bending action the

133
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:17,180
phosphate has generated in the previous

134
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:19,650
contraction cycle is released CSPI

135
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,120
this results in the myosin pivoting

136
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,429
towards the center of the sarcomere

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,949
after which the attached adp and

138
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,509
phosphate group are released so we're

139
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,848
gonna say this power strip this myosin

140
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:31,979
head binds to the ADP and phosphates

141
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:33,478
release well because this is a power

142
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,500
struggle it's actually happening this

143
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:40,019
think of my head is the myosin head and

144
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,389
here's our actin well when it binds to

145
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,088
it and then it's moving and that's

146
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,310
what's causing that sliding motion to

147
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:50,278
occur that's what we're seeing here this

148
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,620
power stroke this might and bending is

149
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:55,139
requiring energy but that's what's

150
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,649
essentially occurring this cross bridge

151
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:02,370
is made and we're having this myosin

152
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:05,028
bind to the actin move causing these

153
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,978
filaments to slide against one another

154
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:10,019
now new molecule of ATP attaches to the

155
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:13,139
myosin head causing the cross bridge to

156
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,810
now detach so initially we kind of went

157
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,360
through we're bound to it we moved it

158
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,649
over then we need a detach and it's

159
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,379
where to go through and repeat this

160
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:24,649
process we detach over here and slide it

161
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,939
again so that's kind of what's occurring

162
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:30,688
we see this cross bridge is now

163
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,990
detaching requiring ATP attaches to the

164
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:35,699
myosin head and Mazda head detaches here

165
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,528
we notice now we have a gap in the

166
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:41,249
junction here looking for another

167
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:44,879
calcium molecule to allow our myosin to

168
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:48,329
to our thin actin filaments lastly the

169
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:51,449
myosin head hydrolysis hydrolysis

170
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:54,869
remember using water to break apart ATP

171
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,088
to ADP in the phosphate which returns -

172
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:59,069
into the cocked position but this means

173
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:02,129
it's ready now to grab onto another

174
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:05,189
molecule before it moves over so again

175
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:08,729
just to quick give a brief recap we see

176
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:10,799
the initial calcium kind of coming in we

177
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:13,468
had that binding site occur we have the

178
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:15,658
myosin head moving over and then

179
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:18,778
detaching I'm getting ready to bind to

180
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:21,209
another site here and again ATP is

181
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:23,548
required for this to occur if you want

182
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,559
the full summary and a great site to

183
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:28,558
kind of pause it on this would be kind

184
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:31,259
of the summary of the five steps that I

185
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:35,299
just covered that go over in explaining

186
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,299
the sliding filament theory
