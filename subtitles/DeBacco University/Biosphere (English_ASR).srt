1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
welcome to a video lecture on the

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,729
biosphere by me mr. Tuvok oh you made

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:10,259
rememory from such films as the

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,300
ecological organization because this

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:15,149
video lecture picks up right where that

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,980
one left off with the biosphere so this

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,750
slide may look familiar if you watched

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,149
that previous video lecture but let's

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,679
start here with the biosphere all the

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,709
biomes together with marine and

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,050
freshwater included the Earth has four

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,000
major connected systems which we are

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,830
going to go over in detail here the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,100
atmosphere the ecosphere the hydrosphere

15
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,439
and lithosphere all coming together to

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,960
form the biosphere which is a portion of

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:44,308
Earth that's inhabited by life including

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,140
all biotic and abiotic parts so starting

19
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,619
with the hydrosphere of Earth's water

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,049
ice and water vapour is all included in

21
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,939
the hydrosphere oceans account for about

22
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,209
ninety six and a half percent of the

23
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:00,119
water I'll bet in salt water and it's

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,120
found in the oceans freshwater is the

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:06,149
remaining three percent and that may be

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,310
locked up in glaciers and ice caps or in

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,170
groundwater or surface and other

28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,090
freshwater this surface and other

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,000
freshwater is mainly the accessible

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,659
component that we have and most of that

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,879
is composed of ground ice permafrost or

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,618
lakes here the fresh water distribution

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,679
and you can notice here it's a very

34
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,810
limiting resource ice is about one point

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,360
seven six two percent groundwater is

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,978
next most abundant and surface

37
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,340
freshwater you can see the very small

38
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,140
percentage of the total hydrosphere

39
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,030
atmosphere in soil is even a smaller

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,739
percentage than that this is why the

41
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,509
world's so concerned with not only the

42
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,519
amount of water we have but really the

43
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,890
amount of fresh water we have access to

44
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,500
this is the vast majority is locked up

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,599
in oceans which is saltwater which is

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,618
not really usable for both human

47
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,438
consumption and also to grow plants the

48
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,180
oceans in iswhat bodies of water hold

49
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,368
the lowest amount of water well it's the

50
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,549
oceans there are largest bodies of water

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,038
on earth however they contain salt water

52
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,899
only you see all the major oceans here

53
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:15,279
the Arctic top Atlantic

54
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:18,818
Pacific River Indian Ocean here so we

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,659
have all of these areas but they're very

56
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:26,049
large but however this is all saltwater

57
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:30,269
not really useable on most forms by a

58
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,269
lot of our terrestrial based life-forms

59
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:36,039
moving on we have oceans and ice of

60
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,220
icebergs they're large pieces of fresh

61
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:43,209
water or ice flowing in open waters well

62
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:45,039
90% of iceberg is below the surface of

63
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,530
the water so it comes back to the

64
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,139
Titanic here and sadly it ran into an

65
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,539
iceberg a very small portion of the

66
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,518
total iceberg is actually exposed above

67
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,739
the water that can be seen the vast

68
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,590
majority of located beneath the water

69
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,769
surface makes them very dangerous for

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,670
traveling boats

71
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,500
continue with that ice we also have

72
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:09,280
glaciers and they're any large mass of

73
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,840
ice it moves slowly over land salad

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,390
we're seeing a lot of the glaciers that

75
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,939
are being reduced I could see the

76
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:18,279
evidence of where the glacier line was

77
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:21,400
here in 1885 and this picture was taken

78
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,409
in 2003 how much is receded again images

79
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,140
of the same area taken in different ears

80
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:29,949
you can see the great receding or

81
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:32,949
something melting of these glaciers the

82
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,969
freshwater locations is surface water so

83
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,639
what's the difference between a water

84
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:38,889
shouldn't River Basin well both terms

85
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,349
are used to describe land that drains

86
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:43,419
into a river stream or lake however a

87
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,750
river basin is the term used is we have

88
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,129
an area that drains into a large river

89
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,599
the watershed is the term used to

90
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:52,539
describe the area that drains into a

91
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,030
smaller river or stream so you can see

92
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:58,358
evidence here of the Connecticut River

93
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,068
and where the river basin is remember

94
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,959
that's the term that describes traits

95
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:03,759
into the large river and then the

96
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,939
watershed is a term used to describe it

97
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,590
drains into smaller river or stream this

98
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:10,509
is kind of be a general overview of the

99
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,969
watershed of the Connecticut River and

100
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:17,519
the river basins would kind of be closer

101
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:17,519
to that large or main river there

102
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,910
something called groundwater so what's

103
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,939
groundwater well simply put its water

104
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,800
that's below the ground the water found

105
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:29,199
in cracks and pores and sand gravel and

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,170
rocks below the earth's surface now the

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,719
low could be just a shallow area here or

108
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,449
it could be deep below now it takes a

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,270
lot of more time for water to penetrate

110
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:42,310
and get down into the deeper layers but

111
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,169
all this is considered groundwater

112
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,240
whether it takes only a couple days to

113
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,120
get below the surface years centuries

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,629
millennia is all considered or falls in

115
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,340
the category of groundwater we have

116
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:56,079
something called aquifers so it's a rock

117
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,509
layer that stores water and allows water

118
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,729
to flow through it aquifers are kind of

119
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,099
like these large almost underground

120
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,650
Lakes that occur on a lot of you can

121
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,240
take a very long time to recharge for

122
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,639
water to get in there if we do pull some

123
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,090
out but they're typically very large

124
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,729
areas if wetlands in the area where

125
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:17,889
water table is at near or above the land

126
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,920
surface long enough during the year to

127
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:24,219
support adapted plant growth so what

128
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,870
land is an area here we see where that

129
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,430
water tables at near or above the

130
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,500
surface it does contain water for an

131
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,620
extended period of time somewhat wounds

132
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,129
can dry up over time but some will hold

133
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,410
water

134
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,959
the key part they are long enough during

135
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,290
the air to support adapted plant growth

136
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,289
Oh

137
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,500
additional hydrosphere vocabulary we

138
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,139
have a tributary which is a stream

139
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,310
feeding a larger stream or lake

140
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,050
tributaries contributing that water and

141
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,149
they can flood during times of heavy

142
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,100
rainfall reservoir is the lake that

143
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:56,409
stores water for human use in an

144
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,120
artesian well is a well in which water

145
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,310
rises because the pressure was in the

146
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,100
aquifer so we see an example here of the

147
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,740
artesian well if the sechín saturation

148
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,600
levels above we punch a hole here a lot

149
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,370
of pressure kind of the water flowing

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,200
down here you can get this kind of free

151
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,110
flow in this natural flow of water

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,939
through an artesian well third we have

153
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,470
the atmosphere so again we're looking at

154
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,889
this virus fear in general looking at

155
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,500
the atmosphere the air blanketing earth

156
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,719
solid and liquid surface so we take a

157
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,610
breath in the amount of air around us

158
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,559
here is mostly composed of nitrogen it's

159
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,929
the most abundant gas in the Earth's

160
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,759
the sphere making up about 70% of the

161
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:39,278
earth the Chur of the immature breeding

162
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,369
here on earth oxygen is the second most

163
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:44,288
abundant making up 21% and living organs

164
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,689
are used as food sources and oxygens

165
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:48,699
utilized by urban adjust other organisms

166
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,699
options released in the atmosphere by

167
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,829
yes as a photosynthesize first

168
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,299
atmosphere has a unique composition of

169
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,668
gases when compared to other plants

170
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:59,438
within the solar system the blue light

171
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,598
is scattered more than other wavelengths

172
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,749
by gases in the atmosphere and that is

173
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,908
in part what gives the blue color to the

174
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:09,009
sky now keep in mind that there is

175
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:11,528
carbon dioxide there is neon there's

176
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,559
helium out of hydrogen but we could see

177
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:17,918
these percentages down here are a lot

178
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:21,099
smaller on nitrogen by far than appears

179
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,649
by far the vast majority at 78% then

180
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:26,558
comes oxygen a little argon we see this

181
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,788
kind of thinness sliver here carbon

182
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:30,338
dioxide is the vast majority of this

183
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:32,259
small portion at point zero four oh

184
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:34,478
seven percent or four hundred parts per

185
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:37,479
million we can see the others are much

186
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,008
smaller but they do exist this

187
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,438
composition the atmospheric looking

188
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,110
specifically at carbon dioxide makes up

189
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,360
approximately 0.03 percent of the

190
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,009
Earth's atmospheric gases and it changes

191
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,829
a little bit depending where you are

192
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,179
it's also sadly changing over time so

193
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:54,218
carbon dioxide concentrations in the

194
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:55,778
atmosphere are regulated by the removal

195
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:58,449
of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by

196
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:59,999
plants as they fix the carbon from

197
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,838
carbon dioxide into carbohydrates

198
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,239
exchanges of contacts between the

199
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:06,098
atmosphere and the oceans there's a

200
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:07,178
there's also chemical reactions that

201
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:09,158
occur within the atmosphere

202
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:11,318
and limestone we're kind of seeing that

203
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:14,498
concentration of carbon dioxide

204
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,459
increase very dramatically over recent

205
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:20,799
years in the atmosphere we have water

206
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:23,379
which is the atmospheres varies

207
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:26,318
considerably and also Nancy hydraulic

208
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:28,809
cycle this cycle is the evaporation and

209
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,939
condensation that results almost daily

210
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,110
here we see kind of that water cycle

211
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,668
here we're having evaporation of water

212
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,740
that condensing the water and

213
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:38,918
precipitation and that kind of water

214
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,778
cycle repeating there in the atmosphere

215
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,208
the atmospheric pressure and this is the

216
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:45,818
pressure the atmosphere exists on earth

217
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:48,489
and it decreases with increasing

218
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:52,028
latitude so if you seal bottle up at a

219
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,188
very high mountain peak when we start

220
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,899
walking down that mountain and we're

221
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:57,669
probably driving poorly realistically

222
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,129
driving down that mountain you can see

223
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:02,169
getting crushed here because this volume

224
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:04,420
of air contains less particles and it

225
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:07,419
does at sea level the greater the

226
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,039
altitude the same volume contains fewer

227
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:10,928
molecules of gases that make up the air

228
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,048
this means that the density of air

229
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:15,519
decreases as you increase in altitude so

230
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:18,370
it's a very tall but very very tall

231
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,159
mountain there'll be less dense air than

232
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,289
if you're at sea level atmospheric

233
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,308
pressure versus altitudes we can see

234
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:28,419
here the atmospheric pressure see more

235
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:31,719
density down here at the very bottom

236
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:33,669
then at the top of a mountain for

237
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,949
example this is a mountain very high

238
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:38,229
Denver for example new mile high it's

239
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:39,969
5,000 tor and 80 feet above sea level

240
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,170
but there's mountains much much higher

241
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,879
than that fourth component on the vast

242
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:48,458
areas of geosphere and this features

243
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,019
Perce surface kinds of rocks sea floor

244
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:52,958
and everything below the earth's surface

245
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,000
it's made up of rocks and rocks are made

246
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,558
up of minerals these minerals are

247
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,600
building blocks for the rocks and

248
00:09:56,558 --> 00:10:01,149
elements are the ultimate building

249
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,519
blocks for those minerals we see that

250
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,230
example here forms of carbon we have a

251
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,778
morphus carbon there's kind of this

252
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,509
blackish kind of substance here we have

253
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:12,458
graphite which is carbon organized into

254
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,159
sheets and then we have diamonds which

255
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:18,548
is carbon organized in a very particular

256
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:20,588
structure there the geosphere is made up

257
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:22,870
of rocks and minerals just eight

258
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,569
elements that count for about 98% of the

259
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,428
Earth's mass elements composed of the

260
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:30,370
Earth's crust as you can see here oxygen

261
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:31,958
and silicon panama by weight very large

262
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,509
percentage there's also aluminum iron

263
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,359
calcium sodium potassium magnesium and a

264
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:39,730
host of others looking at the formation

265
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,889
of the geosphere these are the formation

266
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,990
of elements by the collision of the Sun

267
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:47,318
it's released as heat and it's change

268
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,028
from kinetic energy to heat energy the

269
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:51,909
more gravitational attraction towards

270
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:54,100
plant their Earth's center

271
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:56,110
also can lead to radioactive decay we

272
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,600
see that here the formation of our

273
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,899
geosphere that's caused by the collision

274
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,860
with the Sun was a very very large scale

275
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:07,959
keep - is not exactly to scale here last

276
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,730
we have the layers of the earth we have

277
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,980
that inner core which is actually a

278
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,350
solid turned by the outer core which is

279
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,480
liquid and we have the mantle here

280
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,759
ultimately leading to the very edges

281
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,379
here where we have the Earth's crust

282
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:25,029
here and basically that is the area that

283
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,519
life is we know it exists and we build

284
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,610
from there the interpreter is extremely

285
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,220
hot here it's inner core here being a

286
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:37,649
solid outer core being that liquid

287
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,649
component of basically melted iron
