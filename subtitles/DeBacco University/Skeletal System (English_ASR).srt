1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
all right here my attempt to give a

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,869
brief overview of the skeletal system so

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,699
you can see here hopefully you'll be

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,500
pondering wonderful thoughts about the

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,410
skeletal system and by the end you'll be

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,609
feeling like this so first off achlys

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,079
some videos to keep in mind in the

8
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,118
description there's a link to the slides

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,589
there's some YouTube videos you can

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,939
watch about when San Britain's Got

11
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,039
Talent show and someone who's very

12
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,368
flexible and ones here at looking at

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,849
neck stretching in Myanmar and some of

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,259
the changes that occur physiologically

15
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:33,058
reminder that remember about the

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,190
homologous analogous structures we see

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,959
this kind of the same picture here come

18
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,399
bearing homologous structures will they

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,530
have similar structure but different

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
function and analogous structures keep

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,480
in mind have different structure but

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,979
similar functions these Mulligan

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,500
structures comparing the function of the

24
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,869
phalanges in the human to the bat for

25
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,429
example this is just showing one here

26
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:54,299
we're looking at the Mong is just sort

27
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,820
up here

28
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,589
humans and the phalanges those are your

29
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,149
fingers what the uses were compared to

30
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,899
the bat again ours is for gripping and

31
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,489
grabbing and the bat would be for flying

32
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,950
now changes in the human skeleton that

33
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,109
do occur in embryos the skeleton is

34
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,760
primarily heileen cartilage during

35
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:13,978
development much of this cartilage is

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,350
replaced by a bone not all of it but

37
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,819
much of it there is cartilage it does

38
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:20,039
remain in the body and it's like for

39
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,719
example your ears your nose in your

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,659
throat region and also within your

41
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,548
ribcage so there's different areas also

42
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,090
within your joints you can still have

43
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,210
some remaining cartilage during the

44
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,060
development of the skeletal system at

45
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:38,669
birth this skull bones are not quite

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,900
complete I was actually kind of room for

47
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,868
them to move and there's actually

48
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,079
they're not quite fully fused yet the

49
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:48,239
adult human only has 206 bones that have

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,578
grown together from about 300 bones at

51
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,289
birth so within the skull just as an

52
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,188
example bones are joined by fibrous

53
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,350
membranes called

54
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:57,750
fontanelles these fontanelles are

55
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,879
completely replaced with bone within two

56
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,859
years after birth so if you have a very

57
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,989
early on newborn they'll actually be

58
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,849
little soft spots in their head those

59
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,739
are the fontanelle's that's the gap

60
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,000
between the plates within their skull

61
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,799
they haven't quite fused yet

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,639
help with the birthing process and also

63
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,040
allow the brain to grow and develop now

64
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,449
functions of the skeletal system in

65
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,969
general might be some of them might be

66
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:25,000
very obvious they support the framework

67
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:27,580
cradle the soft organs that you have it

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,620
helps provide them with protection case

69
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,360
of brain or spinal cord or vital organs

70
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,700
that spinal cord runs right down the

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,360
vertebrae all encased in a bone there

72
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,889
it's responsible for a movement it gives

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,780
them muscles something to pull on it's

74
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,849
kind of that lever system for muscles to

75
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,330
pull on also as it acts as a mineral

76
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:48,189
storage which is way the body can kind

77
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,469
of store minerals especially calcium and

78
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,900
phosphorus to be used to help regulate

79
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:55,209
other levels for example calcium there's

80
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,159
very little of it in the blood but it's

81
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,569
a very crucial amount and the body will

82
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,370
actually take it from the bones if it

83
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,699
needs to to help maintain that very

84
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,489
precise level in the skeletal system is

85
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:07,869
important for blood cell formation

86
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,670
because within the bone marrow as we'll

87
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,879
see is responsible for many of the

88
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,829
components of the circulatory system

89
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,359
talked about that cartilage bones in the

90
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,100
cartilage now there's different types of

91
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,810
cartilage so that's important to keep in

92
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,459
mind there's highly news of

93
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,219
fibrocartilage and there's no elastic

94
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,900
cartilage located in different areas the

95
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:28,599
Highland cartilage is for smooth surface

96
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,489
and gliding of particular joints as you

97
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:34,239
can see kind of in your ball and socket

98
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,459
joint elbow do we have elastic cartilage

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,319
is is very flexible makes up the the

100
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,650
exterior of the ear and also your

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,789
epiglottis in your fibro carlos is

102
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,560
resisting strong forces

103
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,759
it's very fibrous compression and

104
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,579
tension that would be very important to

105
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,769
have in your life in your vertebrae

106
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:54,549
between your vertebrae of your spinal

107
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:55,989
cord there's different classifications

108
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,879
of bones there's flat bones irregular

109
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,700
short bones long bones and sesamoid

110
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,539
bones and they're just helpful

111
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,060
classifications and a lot of them make

112
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:06,099
sense flat bones are flat regulars are

113
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,170
kind of those odd kind of shaped short

114
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,280
bones long bones and the sesamoid bones

115
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:10,929
here are kind of like your specialty

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,349
bones as we see in the patella or

117
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,900
kneecap the composition of bone in

118
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,728
general we have an organic component

119
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,788
which is your osteoblasts which is your

120
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,288
bone forming it cells your osteo sites

121
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:23,709
which are mature bone cells that

122
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,779
maintain

123
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:27,788
mineral concentrations in your

124
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:30,269
osteoclast which are large cells that

125
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:32,918
reabsorb or break down the bone matrix

126
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:35,589
so while these all kind of are all start

127
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:38,109
with osteo the last are bone forming

128
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,149
sites are the mature bone cells and

129
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,270
class or the large cells that reabsorb

130
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,008
or break down the bone matrix so these

131
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,478
four types of cells are found within the

132
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:49,229
bone tissue because you can have they're

133
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,339
all organized here these cells

134
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:53,109
osteogenic cells are on differentiate

135
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:55,299
and develop into osteoblasts we kind of

136
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,439
have this thing formation of these

137
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,240
different cells

138
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,610
however when osteoblasts get trapped

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,079
within the calcified matrix their

140
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,180
structure and function changes in to

141
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,459
come osteocytes so some of these have a

142
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,860
unique ability to change unless air

143
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:10,538
osteoclast develop from monocytes and

144
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,610
macrophages and differ in appearance

145
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:15,399
from other bone cells if you were to

146
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,960
look at them under a microscope then we

147
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:20,500
have our inorganic or our mineral

148
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:23,258
components to the bones there's 67% bone

149
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,259
by masses minerals mainly calcium and

150
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:29,050
phosphates so while a bone is composed

151
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:31,538
of thirty-nine percent calcium if you

152
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,240
take all the bones in your body it is 99

153
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:35,529
percent of the body's calcium that one

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,470
percent in the blood that's a very

155
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:40,179
important 1 percent to have minerals are

156
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,729
responsible for the bone hardness and

157
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,079
resistance to compression unless you can

158
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:46,329
again just see the comparison of what a

159
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,189
bones made out of and what percentage it

160
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:50,620
makes up of the body calcium and

161
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,779
phosphate being key ones while a bonus

162
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,759
17 percent phosphate it's again 99

163
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:58,149
percent of your total phosphate in your

164
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,968
system the grocery eye bones are in bone

165
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:03,370
textures the adult skeleton has 206

166
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:05,110
bones there's a compact bone which is

167
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,090
the dense outer layer which gives a lot

168
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,250
of really good strength and inside

169
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,049
there's a honeycomb which is a spongy

170
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,478
bone and this is to help reduce weight

171
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,400
and allow areas to be filled with bone

172
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,008
marrow and could be red or yellow

173
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,899
depending on your age but that stuff

174
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,500
compact bone on the outside really gives

175
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:25,239
bones a lot of their total strength

176
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,968
Mayr produces necessary components of

177
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,650
the circulatory system so that marrow

178
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:31,149
particularly have the long bones we see

179
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:33,250
kind of superimposed image here is

180
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,888
making your red blood cells white blood

181
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,110
cells and also your platelets all very

182
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,160
important for a fully functional

183
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,350
circulatory system red bone marrow is

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,090
soft spongy tissue at the center of

185
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,890
bones that produces red blood cells

186
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:50,409
white blood cells and also those

187
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,699
all-important platelets since the

188
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,100
production of red blood cells requires

189
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,079
iron the marrow is one of the places in

190
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,879
the body that normally stores a supply

191
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,979
of iron this kind of gives you a

192
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,649
real-world image of what it looks like

193
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,060
it's also contains stem cells and stem

194
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:05,979
cells or cells they can kind of be made

195
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,780
into anything here we're looking at

196
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,090
specifically cells that will go along

197
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,579
the path to help or aid in the

198
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,409
circulatory system in some way here we

199
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,609
see the outer surface of the bone we

200
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,530
have the red bone marrow and we have the

201
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,230
yellow bone marrow in the center here in

202
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:22,599
this particular image that yellow bone

203
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,819
marrow that I mentioned it's important

204
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,760
component and it will increase with age

205
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,740
so it contains the global American is

206
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,019
mostly fat and begins to replace red

207
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,629
bone marrow in long bones after about

208
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,459
five years old when were younger our

209
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:38,350
bones contain very little fat and as we

210
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:40,750
age the percentage of fat in the Amero

211
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,580
increases here's an infant less than one

212
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,769
year old completed mostly of that red

213
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,149
bone marrow then childhood one to ten

214
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,430
years old we see that yellow is starting

215
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,859
to occur adolescence ten to twenty years

216
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,259
old much more yellow bones kind of a

217
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,389
yellow marrow within the bones when your

218
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,159
adult considered to be 25 years plus in

219
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,680
this case see the vast majorities been

220
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,150
replaced with yellow bone marrow we

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,340
still have that vital a red bone marrow

222
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,739
to help keep producing some of those

223
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:08,109
vital components of the cell but you

224
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:12,300
could see not nearly as great percentage

225
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,300
as it was when you were in infant
