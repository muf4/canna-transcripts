1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
this is intended to be a brief overview

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,810
of routing hormones its goal is to

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,929
produce you know clones and plans that

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,599
have a nice fibrous root system to allow

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,609
for nutrient water absorption and adding

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,920
hormones can help encourage this to

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,589
happen so first off breeding hormones

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,109
are typically oxen based the one here

9
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:25,320
and one will see is typically they could

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,939
be made from naa or IBA IBA send all

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,670
three butyric acid and that's a very

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,579
common one that's used in many routing

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,350
products so there is a difference

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,420
routine there's a gel-based and there's

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,010
also powder based essentially the

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,050
hormone is the same since this hormone

17
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,718
in this is clone X the both contain that

18
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,699
IBA and all three butyric acid or awful

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,100
often the gel could hear better to the

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,350
stems and the longer the hormone comes

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,448
in contact that can improve the odds of

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,698
rooting my experience clinics gels is

23
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:56,849
superior to most other ones that I've

24
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,439
used however when you're using it be

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,809
sure to store it in the refrigerator

26
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,179
around 40 degrees Fahrenheit so the

27
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,219
hormone the auxin does not degrade with

28
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,409
heat so again while these are both the

29
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:08,969
same hormone this powder tends to be a

30
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,330
little bit harder to stick onto some of

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,530
the stems this purple sticky gel adheres

32
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,539
a little bit better and I think that's

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,019
part of the reason why this one tends to

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,009
encourage a little bit more rooting

35
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:22,140
importance of roots Willers also these

36
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,090
things root hairs they are very thin

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,650
they're about one selfic their

38
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,380
structures allow for maximum absorption

39
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,270
of water and nutrients they create this

40
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,640
web which is a very high surface area to

41
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,099
volume ratio and while they're very

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,719
small they are visible to the naked eye

43
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,478
but they're more easily seen at the aid

44
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,920
of a light microscope careful protection

45
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,989
of root hairs from desiccation the

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,079
physical damage must be taken to ensure

47
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:48,629
that the plant is able to efficiently

48
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,548
and effectively absorb water in

49
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,438
nutrients hormones can help increase

50
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,040
this web that occurs whether we're

51
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,718
talking about clones or cuttings or even

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,770
ceilings to help encourage them to

53
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,769
produce this web
