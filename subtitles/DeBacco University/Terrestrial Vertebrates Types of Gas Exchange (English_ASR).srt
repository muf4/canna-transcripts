1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
okay here we're look at terrestrial

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,660
vertebrates and the type of gas exchange

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
that they go about doing keeping mine

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,800
cells of animals are going to respire

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,960
think they're gonna require oxygen and

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,130
they're going to produce carbon dioxide

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,589
so it needs to be an efficient way to

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,089
exchange those two gases to allow those

9
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:22,829
cells to continue to live and survive so

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,589
looking at gas exchange in the general

11
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,929
sense most primitive phyla of organisms

12
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,448
obtain oxygen directly from the

13
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,909
diffusion of seawater again those are

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,980
all your ocean based organisms not that

15
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,479
main focus of this lecture and keeping

16
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,759
in mind here the picture of the carp

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,339
aquatic animals possess the special

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,899
respiratory organs called gills this

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,520
focus though is on those our little Dan

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,770
based such as the B here

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,710
these arthropods use a network of air

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,530
ducts called trachea and we use special

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:58,289
organs called lungs to allow an

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,698
efficient transfer of gases so our first

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,710
group of organs that we're going to look

26
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,048
at are in fib Ian's and they are

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,170
land-based and are able to respire

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,000
through moist skin in addition to their

29
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,340
lungs so while the main root of their

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,188
respiration is the lungs they are able

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,070
to respire through their skin as well

32
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:19,258
there is a sack with convoluted internal

33
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,298
membranes here the help increases their

34
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,579
surface area at least somewhat and this

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,590
is allowing for gas exchange to occur

36
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,908
keeping in mind that they can also

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,290
respond through their skin and that's

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,810
why they're typically found in moist

39
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,150
environments the image down here shows a

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,379
cross-section of the frogs and just give

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,228
me an appreciation of what that does

42
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,449
actually look like moving on to our

43
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:42,509
reptiles they are more active and as a

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,890
result need more oxygen they cannot

45
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,959
respond through their skin because that

46
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,228
watertight skin so allows them to live

47
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,548
in more of a land-based environment

48
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:52,828
instead their lung contains many more

49
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,630
small chambers which greatly increases

50
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,609
the overall surface area over our

51
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,810
exhibits they need that increase in

52
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,540
surface air because they're solely

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,750
dependent on their lungs and cannot

54
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,590
aspire through their skin lastly our

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,090
mammals we have even a greater oxygen

56
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,009
demand than the reptiles or the

57
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,959
amphibians merely because we maintain

58
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,859
this constant body temperature this

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,349
requires our cell

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,030
be very active we increase our surface

61
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,489
area even more through two specialized

62
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,099
structures we see here the alveoli are

63
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,689
small chambers interior of the lung they

64
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,090
like these kind of great like structures

65
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:28,579
the bronchioles are short passageways

66
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,259
that connect a bunch of these clusters

67
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,960
what this does is this vastly increases

68
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:37,169
the surface area in our lungs allowing a

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,599
very efficient transfer of oxygen and

70
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:41,309
carbon dioxide so that our cells which

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,859
are we could aspire and a great rate

72
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,310
we're able to maintain that degree of

73
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,310
homeostasis
