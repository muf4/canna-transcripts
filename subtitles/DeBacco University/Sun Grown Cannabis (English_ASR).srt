1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,129
i'm going to talk about

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:13,199
sun grown cannabis

4
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:14,559
[Music]

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,879
if you're looking to learn more about

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,480
sun grow cannabis let's get into the

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,320
video lecture here

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
and really sun grown cannabis is really

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
just outdoor grown it's just a term

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,160
that's been given

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,199
to the outdoor grown cannabis that's

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,599
being produced

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,118
however sun grown is intended to imply

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
that there's a greater focus on

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,159
sustainable practices

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,399
somehow does not have an exact

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,479
definition though and it implies that

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,120
the sun is the main source of light or

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,599
energy

20
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,640
in not electrical power the idea behind

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,640
this term

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
is that the cannabis has been farmed

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
sustainably healthy

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,159
and in natural environments so that's

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,079
kind of what this term is meant to mean

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,919
even though there's not an exact current

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
definition for it

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,840
so why indoor grown in the first place

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,280
you know why why is there such a thing

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
as inter-grown cannabis and that's

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
because

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,239
indoor cultivation of cannabis is simply

33
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,438
due to the prohibition of cannabis

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
forcing growers

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,959
to grow in isolated private locations

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,879
that were typically

37
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,798
in an indoor area this caused

38
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,560
technologies to be developed to allow

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,799
for this type of propagation

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
which increase the dependency on

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,439
electricity

42
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
so an estimated three percent of

43
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,679
california's household

44
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,438
energy use is due simply to the indoor

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
cannabis cultivation

46
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,758
so again sun grown we're utilizing that

47
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,640
sun reducing the amount of energy needed

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
particularly for

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,879
lights they can also relate to heat as

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
well

51
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,438
cost of replicating the sun's energy so

52
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
in a national level in 2011 it was

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:41,758
estimated

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,519
that the energy consumption for indoor

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,399
cannabis consumes 1

56
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,879
of the national electric usage or about

57
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
6

58
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,319
billion per year according to the source

59
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,478
located right there

60
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,398
this equates to the production of carbon

61
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,200
emissions equal to that of three

62
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,799
million average u.s cars for every one

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,118
kilogram of indoor cannabis

64
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
produced so as a result this is what

65
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,078
caused the outdoor or sun-grown

66
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
movement to try to reduce some of this

67
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,239
production of energy

68
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,079
when we have the natural sun so

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,520
sometimes energy savings is that with

70
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
outdoor production this can nearly

71
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
eliminate the energy needed

72
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,439
for the growing of cannabis which

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,479
reduces the environmental impacts and

74
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,239
also the cost

75
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,479
to the grower so it's a great thing

76
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,400
where you can utilize natural resources

77
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,318
and when we have access to the sun well

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
that's a great savings there and

79
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,000
also environmentally friendly in

80
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
addition to savings growers

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,318
often use organic products local water

82
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,919
in that natural sunlight there so

83
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,598
reducing cost while hopefully

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,518
maintaining good yields

85
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,518
the sun grown advantage states that

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
potencies can be achieved when best

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
practices are used

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
and there's the source you can find in

89
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
the description this is supported by

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
this statement

91
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,640
that sun-grown diverges from outdoor

92
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
because it adheres to the use of organic

93
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,759
practices

94
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,680
and fertilizers so sun-grown chemist

95
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,560
also carries a myriad of environmental

96
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,480
benefits

97
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
due to avoiding the use of harsh and

98
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,639
artificial additives

99
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,680
so this is where that term sun grown is

100
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,279
being utilized

101
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
to distinguish it just from outdoor

102
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
growing even though the plants are grown

103
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,639
outdoors that sun-grown label is

104
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
implying that there's a more

105
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,158
focus by the grower to sustainable

106
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,239
practices

107
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,759
so what are the limitations of sun-grown

108
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,039
cannabis well with the variability of

109
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,560
the outdoor environment

110
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,719
these variable conditions can cause

111
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
stresses on the plant and reduce overall

112
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,840
production

113
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,599
equipment used to reduce some of these

114
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,158
impacts can reduce the overall carbon

115
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,280
footprint

116
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,439
efficiency of a growing operation

117
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,959
but often will help increase yields so

118
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,878
growers can be caught in that

119
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,719
kind of limbo where if they're going to

120
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,359
implement some

121
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,199
kind of practices that may help reduce

122
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,760
or buffer some of these stresses

123
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,280
they may be also adding more carbon

124
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,318
which is what they're trying to reduce

125
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,080
with the idea behind sun grown

126
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,518
in addition the seasonality of different

127
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
regions can also limit the amount of

128
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
growing cycles that can be completed

129
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
within a calendar

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,158
year so that can be limiting as well

131
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
now some grown anecdotal accounts so

132
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,359
people will say

133
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,239
well sun grown will produce increased

134
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,799
potency

135
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,560
improve plant health more aromas wider

136
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
terpene profiles but again these are

137
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
more anecdotal

138
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,319
and not necessarily confirmed on

139
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
scientific lab tests

140
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,319
the sun spectrum advantage this is one

141
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,519
thing that we can agree on is that there

142
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,199
has been lighting studies that

143
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,319
demonstrate that there's improved plant

144
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
performance with uv

145
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,199
light and also far red light wavelengths

146
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
as these do contribute to the

147
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,319
photosynthetic process and both of these

148
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,959
are products

149
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,839
produced naturally in the environment

150
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,359
while this may be

151
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,599
true other stresses that typically

152
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,600
reduce the overall quality of the buds

153
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
so while we're getting a better spectrum

154
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
that full kind of sun spectrum

155
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
there could be other stresses such as

156
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,960
temperature humidity rain events

157
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,960
fluctuations in inconsistencies and kind

158
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,359
of moderation of temperature as well

159
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,120
over time the duration of sun all those

160
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
can be kind of play into the

161
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
reduction in the overall quality of the

162
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,520
buds so lastly what's the goal

163
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,520
of for sun grown growers is that the

164
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,198
goal of those growers is selecting the

165
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,038
follow the practices of sun ground will

166
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,319
have less overall cost compared to

167
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,038
indoor production

168
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,120
however the final product quality may be

169
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,639
a battle and not often won compared to

170
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,879
indoor operations

171
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,079
so sun ground growers goals should be

172
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,360
focused on sustainable

173
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,879
practices and total biomass production

174
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,038
due to the reduced cost per plant

175
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,879
growers can often grow more plants

176
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,279
and win the biomass production game

177
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,120
compared to those indoor growers

178
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,679
however growing a product for final dry

179
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,840
flour will meet stiff competition

180
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,918
from the indoor market so growers should

181
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,959
be considering some form of extraction

182
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,399
for their product

183
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,439
if you're looking at growing the sun

184
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,359
ground route simply with the lack of

185
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,439
need of energy inputs for example for

186
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,680
lighting for the photosynthetic process

187
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,000
typically these growers if they have the

188
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,360
land can produce more biomass and

189
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,918
produce more plants

190
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
because of the reduced cost overall and

191
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,038
hopefully

192
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,519
make up the difference with extraction

193
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,839
simply by the increased number of plants

194
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,719
compared to those indoor growers which

195
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,799
need to have

196
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,800
maximum yield because they have a lot of

197
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
inputs and upfront costs

198
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,919
hopefully this provides you just a

199
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,800
little idea of what sun grown cannabis

200
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,799
is all about
