00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,879
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
going to go over passive point injection

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:16,719
for carbon dioxide delivery related to

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:17,519
cannabis plant production

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,358
all right if you're thinking about

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,960
implementing one of these systems let's

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
go over some things you should be aware

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,199
of if you're using passive point

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,679
injection

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
as a method of delivering carbon dioxide

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,239
for your growing space

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
so first off passive point injection

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,920
this is by far the simplest

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,599
setup compared to all the other options

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,679
that exist however if

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,679
used at all it should only be in

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,558
situations that have very limited number

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,558
of plants

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,479
basically no more than three spaces

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,159
should be kept relatively small

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,839
this can cause high concentrations of

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,679
carbon dioxide in small growing areas

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,719
leading to uneven conditions within the

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,558
grow space

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,120
so while is does offer some simplicity

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,799
there is also some drawbacks to this

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,878
design as well

28
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,558
now if you're adding carbon dioxide you

29
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,839
still will have some benefits the

30
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:04,878
addition of carbon dioxide will provide

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
the plant benefits

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
again assuming all other conditions are

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,719
not limiting but if you are going

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
through the trouble of setting up a

35
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,079
carbon dioxide enrichment system

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
you want to make sure that it's as

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,000
efficient as possible because as we're

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,798
talking about our ambient levels around

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,879
400

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
yes as we increase those that's great

41
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,239
but we want to make sure we're

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,280
consistently having levels above the

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,000
ambient levels

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,478
to get the most benefit from our plants

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,319
now in

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,519
large grow rooms as we can kind of see

47
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,919
here

48
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,519
if this simple point injection system is

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,519
used there's a chance

50
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,438
that there will be differences noticed

51
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,798
in the plants that are close to

52
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,359
and compared to those plants that are

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,840
far from the point of injection

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,879
so for large areas be sure to factor in

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
a delivery system

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,239
which can often be forgotten about

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
despite its simplicity

58
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,239
and it's also necessity you want to make

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,320
sure all plants are getting equal

60
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,920
distribution so you're getting an equal

61
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,279
consistent grow not getting some that

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,519
are much more aggressive and some that

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
are

64
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,280
much less simply because you did not

65
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,959
equally distribute

66
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
your carbon dioxide that you were

67
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,840
enriching in this

68
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,840
example of a larger room
