1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,318
so in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,399
going to walk you through step by step

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,040
how i go about setting up a ventilation

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:16,800
system

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:18,399
for a cannabis grow tent

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
as you may have figured out this is a

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,358
little bit of a longer video but i'm

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,679
going to go over how to set up a

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,960
ventilation system for cannabis grow 10

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,920
in detail and the structure of this

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,519
video despite its

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
length is i'm going to show you the

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,919
setup starting with the intake and

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,160
following the path

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
air would take specifics of the design

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,199
will be covered to help

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
maximize airflow in the tent while also

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,600
minimizing the potential for plant odors

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,199
to escape the growing environment how to

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,879
adjust airflow with the use of speed

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
control valves will be shown

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,919
lastly specific products used in the

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,238
video will be highlighted

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,280
to allow for an easy replication of the

25
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,959
system

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,879
now the basics kind of equipment that i

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,160
will be using i've seen me twice there

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,839
i'll go over the intake i'm going to

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,198
show you a hepa filter an inline fan

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,160
with a speed control i'm going to show

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,079
you some ducting

32
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,640
for exhaust we have a pre-filter carbon

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,280
filter more ducting and inline fan

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,118
followed by exhaust end ducting to

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,680
another carbon filter

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,879
so enjoy the video i go through step by

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
step in detail

38
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,399
hopefully you make it to the end

39
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,719
so then after to take you through the

40
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,798
path of air we have the air first coming

41
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,519
in here with our shroom filter our hepa

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,640
filter

43
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,078
going through our first fan and going

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,478
through this six inch

45
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,519
tubing going right into the bottom of

46
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,280
the tent

47
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,280
you come around the bottom of the tent

48
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,039
as we come around the bottom of the tent

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,719
you can see here this is the air where

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,159
it's actively getting added

51
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,239
in this is adding air at the lower point

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
right above our reservoir for our flood

53
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,438
and drain table

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,879
then as the air kind of gets mixed

55
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,599
throughout we'll have some plants

56
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,478
growing here

57
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,759
fan for circulation the very top here

58
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,318
you can notice we have

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
our first carbon filter that's a six

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,439
inch by 24.

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,159
that air is going to come up through

62
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,680
here and work its way it pulled through

63
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,840
this other fan this other inline fan

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,159
there's our fan gonna come out the fan

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,400
here

66
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,439
here it is here's our continued air

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
ducting

68
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,680
six inches running down the side only

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,560
because i wanted to run it through

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920
yet another carbon filter so we have

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,159
another carbon filter

72
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,559
right here and that is ultimately going

73
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,039
to take out any potential odors

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,439
before they get into the room here so

75
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,878
just a quick flow of a great example of

76
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,199
a high-end

77
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:51,840
ventilation system that also will remove

78
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,839
any cannabis odors

79
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,399
okay so what you're going to see here is

80
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,878
i'm going to go through this 4x2 grow

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,879
tent

82
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,840
the ventilation system because we know

83
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,079
it's important for plants to have air

84
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
circulation

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
but when we're in a grow tent we want to

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
be isolating that air

87
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,000
so this not only is going to add air to

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
the environment we're going to see a

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
carbon filter that's going to help

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,840
filter that air so there'll be no odors

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,400
leaving the grow tent here

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,039
so it's important that when we seal this

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
structure

94
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,560
we have a way to get air in and a way to

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,400
get air out

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
so let's start with the intake well here

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,519
we have a hyper fan

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,280
this is a stealth hyper fan picture

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,158
right here the actual

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
fan what's great about this fan is it's

101
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,598
called a hyper

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,680
stealth fan so it gets that name because

103
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,079
it runs very quietly

104
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,439
the fan itself is very small but what

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,560
ends up happening

106
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,280
is there is a lot of foam

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,759
that foam acts as a way to cancel out a

108
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,959
lot of

109
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,959
noise so this is a great fan we're

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
we're here in a lab room now that people

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
share so we want to make sure it's as

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
quiet as possible so we're going to have

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,319
fans in this area

114
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,919
with a lot of foam that's going to take

115
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,598
air in here and go through and

116
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,119
add it to the tent however we don't want

117
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,079
to leave this area on the top

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,000
open so to prevent anything from getting

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
into our fan into our

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,039
grow tent there's something here called

121
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,719
like a hepa filter

122
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,798
this one's called a shroom to be

123
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
specific what's really great about this

124
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,478
is it easily fits

125
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,400
right on top is a great way to kind of

126
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,560
filter out any particulate

127
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,918
so we're looking at our fan here it's

128
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
open up here it's going to be the intake

129
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,959
and it's going to send the air down this

130
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,800
way we don't want to just leave this

131
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,399
open to the air for multiple reasons one

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,759
we want anything to fall in there

133
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,159
but two we don't have anything to get

134
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,479
into the into the fan to damage it

135
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
or into the grow tint itself so they

136
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,959
make these little

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,639
nice little filters here these little

138
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,120
hepa filters this is particularly called

139
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,918
a dust

140
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,720
shroom this will go right on top of our

141
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,039
fan motor

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
here in a moment so this is a six inch

143
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
fan so i've got the

144
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,519
six inch dust room what's really easy is

145
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,520
the installation

146
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,719
literally is just looks like a little

147
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,959
little mushroom there

148
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
it will literally just go basically sit

149
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,638
right on top

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
so while that's really easy to to do is

151
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,120
a vital component of this

152
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
ventilation system so now i've got the

153
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,160
cord here going to plug the

154
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,199
stealth hyperfan in we're going to hear

155
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,199
it spool up immediately

156
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,719
so what's the excellent thing about

157
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,000
these hyper fans is they also have a way

158
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
to control them

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,279
so there's a way to regulate exactly how

160
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,159
much air

161
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,000
flow is here is going through this fan

162
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
okay now as we look at the fan here we

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,519
see that there is a

164
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
speed control that comes with this fan

165
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,879
so this uh

166
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,478
stealth hyper fan what's great has its

167
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,000
own little speed control

168
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,839
i'm going to see how those adjustments

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,439
come into play in just a moment

170
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,038
keep in mind we do have the top here

171
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,959
with our hepa filter

172
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,038
so this is filtering any air that comes

173
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,519
in the air flow through here is going

174
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,759
down

175
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,000
through the fan which is running right

176
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
now it's gonna come down through

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,038
the tubing here that's ultimately going

178
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,839
to go

179
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,399
into our grow tent i want to see that

180
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,000
intake

181
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,599
okay now in this grow tent this is a

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
four by two grow tent

183
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,039
we have a flood and drain table here and

184
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,560
that intake that we saw with the air

185
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:12,879
comes in just above the reservoir there

186
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,959
so if we look down we can see the

187
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,240
reservoir for the flood and drain table

188
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,918
right there and that tubing that's

189
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,960
located right there is

190
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,240
actively adding air to the grow tent so

191
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,000
as i mentioned it's important for air

192
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
circulation so this is a great way to

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,639
kind of go through and

194
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,840
be adding air um into the grow tent but

195
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,000
we also now

196
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,439
for adding air we're gonna need a way to

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
exhaust air

198
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,240
and we're gonna see the exhaust phase

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,199
next okay so as shown before that's

200
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,038
our intake down by the water reservoir

201
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,960
for the flood and drain table

202
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:51,439
and as we work our way up

203
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,560
here's our 4x2 row tent we're now going

204
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,439
to focus our attention

205
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,839
at the top of the structure here so

206
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,959
what's

207
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,239
immediately in our view right here is a

208
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,079
carbon filter

209
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
now it's got a covering over it to help

210
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,519
any particulate but underneath that

211
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,719
is the actual carbon component so let's

212
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,240
take a look at that

213
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,080
so the reason why the carbon filter is

214
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,918
mounted here towards the top

215
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,000
if you want to remove the hot air as

216
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,680
well so we're adding air at the bottom

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and we're going to be removing the top

218
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
warmer air there's been a pvc pipe

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,240
installed we've got some

220
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,038
of these light adjusting hooks here to

221
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
help keep this

222
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,719
as high as possible but still allowing

223
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
some

224
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
kind of clearance at the top now what

225
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,719
we're noticing here

226
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,000
is we have just a little pre-filter so

227
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,440
they come with pre-filters

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
you can wash them but always good just

229
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,959
have an extra on hand just in case you

230
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,598
tear it or something goes wrong with it

231
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,000
chiefs are easy they're easy easy to

232
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,478
store

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
and they're very light so that's the

234
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,000
pre-filter

235
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
what's below that is our actual carbon

236
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
filter

237
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,879
the one i've chosen here is kind of an

238
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
oversized it's an activated carbon

239
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,039
filter

240
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
made by the company fat and it's

241
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,279
designed for

242
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:06,318
500 cubic feet per minute

243
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,598
so this filter is sitting basically

244
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,598
right here we're going to see another

245
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,439
one of them in a moment

246
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,120
what this is doing now is we're going to

247
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,519
have a fan on the other side

248
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
this is going to pull air through that

249
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,000
so any

250
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,439
air that has any odor with it or the

251
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,918
warmest air is going to come through

252
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,399
this activated carbon filter

253
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,318
be removed from particulate which will

254
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,399
help the carbon last a little bit longer

255
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
remove of odor and then go through the

256
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,439
fan which is our next step

257
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,598
so continuing on with our ventilation

258
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,879
system here's our carbon filter pulling

259
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,800
out the hottest air

260
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,240
and deodorizing it as it goes through

261
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,319
those activated uh

262
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
carbon and then it goes right through

263
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,320
another one of those

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
stealth hyper fans so the reason why

265
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,320
another stealth hyper fan

266
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
is right here is to help move air

267
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,519
through here

268
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,958
and out of the grow tent now we don't

269
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,879
see any branding here because the way i

270
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,000
had to mount it but we can see it is

271
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,838
mounted high

272
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,320
and this is kind of the size of the fan

273
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,240
this is all that sound cancelling foam

274
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
installed in there which really does a

275
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,839
great job of reducing any noise

276
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,518
i mentioned before the one on the

277
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,480
outside has got a speed control which i

278
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,159
have installed

279
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,159
this one could have the same option but

280
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,360
i choose not to run a speed control

281
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,879
the reason why i choose not trying to

282
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,759
speed control is this is very

283
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,600
restrictive

284
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,120
to pull through this carbon filter it's

285
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
got to exhaust through another carbon

286
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,919
filter

287
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,799
so i run this one at 100 percent and i

288
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,879
adjust the one

289
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,000
on the outside so let's continue a

290
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,559
little bit further

291
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
with this ventilation system okay and as

292
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,000
we follow that air if it's been through

293
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,799
one carbon filter and through the fan

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,080
it's now coming outside of the grow tent

295
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,879
so if you can follow this

296
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,480
down here we're starting to see there

297
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,000
that air is coming right through

298
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
it normally just be exhausted to the

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,039
outside environment but here i've chosen

300
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,479
another step

301
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,480
chosen actually to run it through

302
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,120
another carbon filter

303
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,639
something you typically won't see

304
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,639
there's a reason for this

305
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,838
so this gives you a little bit closer

306
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,720
inspection

307
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,600
of that carbon filter and how fine all

308
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
of those little

309
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
pores are the reason why is run through

310
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,120
another carbon filter

311
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,320
this is to help ensure that there's no

312
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,919
odor that is exhausted out of the tent

313
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
so again as we come down that exhaust

314
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,360
air is coming through here it's going to

315
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,120
go run through another carbon filter

316
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,440
now this one unlike the one we saw

317
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,399
inside the grow tent doesn't have

318
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279
one of the pre-filters on it the reason

319
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,278
being that

320
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,039
the air's already been through the hepa

321
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,200
filter and through the other pre-filter

322
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,039
not really needed if you do want to run

323
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,800
one i'd run it on the inside because

324
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,319
that would trap any particulate

325
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,719
then on the outside we want to make sure

326
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,839
it's exhausting as easy as possible

327
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,560
so this is just another one a

328
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,200
exact same size of the one that we saw

329
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,159
on the

330
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
inside there some of those fat filters

331
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,759
uh

332
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,879
definitely oversized it's six inches in

333
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,759
neck diameter here by

334
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,200
24 inches so not only do we run it

335
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,200
through one or ran it through another

336
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,720
and air that comes through here that

337
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,800
will then be the air that goes

338
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
into the space so by running it through

339
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,159
two carbon filters it really

340
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,399
eliminates all sense of odor uh we

341
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,480
are in a shared space here so it's

342
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,600
important to keep that in mind

343
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,240
now you saw me mention about the speed

344
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,560
control

345
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,079
on the fan and how i run the one in the

346
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,838
tent at full blast

347
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,838
and i adjust the one on the outside so

348
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,200
let's see how i adjust it and why i

349
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
adjust it in that way

350
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
okay it's a little bit hard to show on

351
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
camera but i'm gonna make an attempt

352
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
here

353
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,000
what i have done now is i've got both

354
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
fans running and i've got the entire

355
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
grow tent sealed

356
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,519
now to determine what the right amount

357
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,360
of air circulation is

358
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,360
is you kind of want the grow tent to

359
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,079
kind of be

360
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
flat you kind of want the material not

361
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,359
to be building out or

362
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,640
pushed in and when you kind of give a

363
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
little bit of pressure on it you can see

364
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,600
it bounces

365
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
back this is a sign that's dialed in and

366
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,120
the air coming in

367
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,000
the same relatively speaking is the air

368
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,839
going out

369
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,679
keep in mind that main one at the top

370
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,160
running at full speed and i'm adjusting

371
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,319
the one

372
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,559
on the outside adjusting how much air

373
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
comes in this is the correct amount

374
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,278
but now let me turn that way down and

375
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,278
see how things change

376
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,000
so for the purposes now i've basically

377
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
turned off

378
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,039
the fan on the outside it's really just

379
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,440
a very minimal amount

380
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,078
you can start to see this side being

381
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
pushed

382
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,919
in reason being the exhaust fan at the

383
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,278
top is still running at full speed so

384
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,159
it's exhausting more

385
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,720
air than it's coming in now as a result

386
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,879
you can notice it's much tighter

387
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,160
it has a lot of negative pressure that

388
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,958
air is being pulled out very

389
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,120
aggressively

390
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,719
there's not a lot of air there so this

391
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,879
has created a great billowing

392
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,560
effect here this is a sign when that air

393
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,879
is too little this is a sign that

394
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,638
you want to add some more air let me go

395
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,559
to the other extreme and let me turn the

396
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,159
outside one on a 100

397
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,159
just like the inside one is

398
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,799
so now i've turned the outside one to

399
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,240
100 percent which is not very

400
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,278
restrictive so that's going to be adding

401
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
more air than the

402
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,278
exhaust fan is going to be able to take

403
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,160
out you can see this already starting to

404
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,759
rise it's getting closer to me

405
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,759
and now it's billowing out so because

406
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,319
we're adding more air then it can be

407
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,399
removed you can notice that we

408
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
definitely have this billowing effect

409
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,958
this is a sign you're adding too much

410
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,639
air aggressively then you are exhausting

411
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,559
so what's great about a grow tent is it

412
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,519
allows you very quickly to be able to

413
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,679
assess

414
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,360
uh your airflow a little harder in a

415
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,638
larger grow space but this kind of gives

416
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
you that idea here and i'll get the

417
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
building effect

418
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
if i go through now and turn it back

419
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,480
where it was at kind of the ideal amount

420
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,160
we'll notice this will kind of come in a

421
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
little bit but it's not going to be

422
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,480
pushed all the way in

423
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,720
it's not going to be pushed all the way

424
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,278
out at the convex or concave it's going

425
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,199
to be

426
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,480
kind of even it's going to have a little

427
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,120
bit of pressure there just

428
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
getting it there's airflow but not super

429
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,039
tight or

430
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,079
super loose so this is a great way to

431
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,000
make sure

432
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,078
you're ventilating your plants properly

433
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,600
but also controlling odors

434
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,599
and this is the fan way down

435
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,360
this is turning it way up and

436
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,958
immediately responds so it's a great

437
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,800
little speed control

438
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,319
and then for the grow tent i have here

439
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,319
dialed in it's pretty much

440
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,560
right about there so it gives you that

441
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
nice kind of way to quickly be able to

442
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,599
assess

443
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,320
the speed of the fan to dial in for your

444
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,320
grow setup

445
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,360
okay so here i'm just going to go over a

446
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,880
couple products that we saw today again

447
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,919
i'm not sponsored by any of these

448
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,000
companies but

449
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,278
let's go over a couple of them so the

450
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,559
first one here is

451
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,399
the hyper stealth fans

452
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,559
why did i choose to add not one but

453
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,278
actually two of these well what makes

454
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,759
these kind of

455
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,360
so great is that they're very quiet so

456
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,679
when you're in the area that has a lot

457
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
of

458
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,679
other people around or if you're running

459
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,759
two of them in particular

460
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,000
you just don't want a lot of disturbance

461
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,120
these are a great fan to kind of add as

462
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,480
i mentioned the fan

463
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,198
is the same hyper fan that is sold

464
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,879
singly

465
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,120
but what makes this so big is that there

466
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,278
is a lot of foam and insulation

467
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,879
there's a lot of kind of area here to

468
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,519
help

469
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,919
dampen that noise and it really does a

470
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,039
great job even running at full speed

471
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,679
i mentioned the hyper fans in addition

472
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,639
also come with these little uh variable

473
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,000
speed controls

474
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,919
which are great a lot of other companies

475
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,278
have to purchase them separately this is

476
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,679
great to kind of have come

477
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,639
come with it i'll plug it right in and

478
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,439
as you saw

479
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,480
in the grow tent this works quite well

480
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
so again these

481
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,360
stealth hyper fans are going to pay a

482
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,278
little bit more probably for all the

483
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,879
extra features that it has

484
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,799
but in my opinion definitely worth it

485
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,559
and we saw it functioning very well with

486
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,719
our grow tent

487
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,719
another product you saw downstairs was

488
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
the actual carbon filter

489
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
so while this might be a little

490
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,959
oversized everything that you saw

491
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,399
was all matched and sized appropriately

492
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,719
this is a six inch

493
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,480
by 24 inch carbon filter the hyper fan

494
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
that we saw also was another

495
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,199
six inch so what is so great about these

496
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,000
carbon filters is that they really are

497
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,240
able to kind of

498
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,839
reduce any of the odor and we saw two

499
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
installed so i had one where air was

500
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,199
kind of being pulled through this

501
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,958
and then one were areas being kind of

502
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,958
exhausted through it

503
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,319
with a hyper fan in between so that

504
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,518
ensured that

505
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
movement of air was adequate so you can

506
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
never really go

507
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,359
too big with one of these as long as

508
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
your fans are inline fans or sized

509
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,680
appropriately

510
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
so that's why i chose to go with not

511
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,078
only one that was probably

512
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,759
sized appropriately for that tent but i

513
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,078
went with two just to ensure there'd be

514
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,199
no

515
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,278
chance of any odors escaping that tent

516
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,639
while still maintaining good ventilation

517
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,879
for the

518
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,198
plants inside now these do come with

519
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,039
what i do always purchase separately

520
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,319
little pre-filters but it's important to

521
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,919
get some of these because they'll just

522
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
prevent any particulate

523
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,000
of them clogging up the very fine pores

524
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,278
of the carbon you want it very fine

525
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,159
it's also important remember with carbon

526
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,799
filters you want to keep your humidity

527
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,000
kind of below 75 or 80 percent because

528
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,879
the moisture in the air

529
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,480
will really reduce the effectiveness of

530
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
that fine surface area

531
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,360
of the carbon filter if you use them

532
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,558
appropriately and get them size

533
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,438
appropriate they can work

534
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,119
great now something else we saw with the

535
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,679
grow tent downstairs was kind of one of

536
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,000
these

537
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,240
hepa filters so i want to try to

538
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,359
maintain and keep your air as clean as

539
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,558
possible

540
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,759
coming into the grow tent and this is a

541
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,079
great way to do that

542
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,679
so these hepa filters allow that kind of

543
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,199
purification of the air

544
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
now there can be another hassle to add

545
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
another filter but what makes these so

546
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
great is you saw these kind of fall

547
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,280
right on top

548
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,558
and they can rest right there they

549
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,759
prevent any large particulates from

550
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,759
getting into the fan

551
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,200
and they also prevent any fine

552
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,640
particulates do you have to be cleaned

553
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,200
and washed occasionally

554
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
uh but well worth work worth with this

555
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
one

556
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
because it's very easily washable it

557
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,918
doesn't restrict any in the flow it's

558
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,679
reusable

559
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
uh and again you can see at the bottom

560
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,360
here uh it is sized appropriately so

561
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,240
again we're sticking everything

562
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,038
being six inches with the setup that you

563
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,599
just saw

564
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,879
so the stream filter here great way to

565
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,359
kind of help ensure

566
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
air entering about before it enters your

567
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,918
grow tent

568
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,798
is already gone through at least one

569
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,160
stage of filtration to do a quick recap

570
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,000
of everything we saw

571
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,840
we started with that hepa filter here

572
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,359
allowing air to get kind of initially

573
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,038
cleaned and purified preventing from

574
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,959
getting to our filter

575
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:29,919
the the fan that we used was a

576
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,679
hyper hyperfan stealth edition uh so we

577
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,038
allowed this to kind of help pull the

578
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,559
air through its brakes at a speed

579
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,879
control on the outside

580
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,079
then ran through some six inch ducting

581
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,919
into our tent

582
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,678
and then at the very top of our tent

583
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,640
where the air is the hottest

584
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,000
we had a carbon filter if you don't

585
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
recognize it

586
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,519
keep in mind that we did have the

587
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,960
pre-filter um on there you're always

588
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,359
good to get an extra

589
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,200
ran through one of these came back

590
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,319
through another hyper fan

591
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,919
and then back to another carbon filter

592
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,918
on the outside of the tent

593
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,240
to have that double kind of carbon

594
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,000
filtration to reduce any chance

595
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,919
that odors would be escaping the grow

596
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,640
tent okay now something i mentioned to

597
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
kind of make

598
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,120
all these kind of products come together

599
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,759
and work appropriately is that in-line

600
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,918
kind of ducting so you can get some that

601
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,919
is insulated to make it even more quiet

602
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,000
the key part is here watch the eggs

603
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,840
because the metal can be quite sharp

604
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
when you cut it but it doesn't take very

605
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,279
much it can be a very small piece

606
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,240
can really expand outwards uh

607
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,639
quite well there so when you're running

608
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,919
it

609
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
keep in mind this is going to have a lot

610
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,200
of air inside it so that it is going to

611
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,639
want to expand

612
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,120
so keep in mind that you do want to

613
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
expand it and then have an idea and cut

614
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,399
it to length that way

615
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
you can always buy a little bit extra

616
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
use it for a couple other things but you

617
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,520
saw it kind of a nice way to kind of

618
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,679
hook

619
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,079
and join everything together and keep

620
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,759
the system of air controlled

621
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,199
and you want to try to eliminate as many

622
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,440
of the right angles or

623
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,960
180 degree turns as you can the

624
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,080
straighter the more efficient with

625
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
everything that you flow

626
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,519
here everything because it was a little

627
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,840
oversized allows for

628
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,720
some chance for having a little bit of a

629
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,720
saw a couple

630
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:19,759
nine degree turns but try to minimize

631
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:19,759
those as much as possible
