1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,480
on this debaco university video why

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,839
flower id is important for cannabis

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,919
production will be covered

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,759
there also is another video on this

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,558
channel which will go over exactly

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:17,920
how to identify both male and female

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,919
flowers on cannabis plants

8
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:24,799
[Music]

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,479
so we see pictured here a nice female

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,278
flower we're going to go over in this

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
video lecture

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:33,119
wi-fi flower identification is important

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,600
for cannabis production so first off we

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,159
have those

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
male versus female flowers that we need

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,519
to be mindful

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
and well-versed in identifying because

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,879
cannabis plants produce distinctive male

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
and female plants

20
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,878
they are a diocese plant you have a male

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,439
plant or you're going to have a female

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,039
plant

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,878
female flowers or plants produce the

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,679
buds where the cannabinoids and terpenes

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,000
are produced

26
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,600
and the plants are considered to be very

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
sought after by growers

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,879
male flowers or plants produce pollen

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
and which is needed for

30
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,479
the formation of seed production male

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,320
plants need to be removed from an

32
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,399
area of female plants to allow for

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,079
female flowers to remain unpollinated

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
and produce chemical compounds in the

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,200
greatest concentration

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
this is called the sensamilla or

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
seedless harvest for if we have a male

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,799
and a female plant together

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,879
the female plant will then produce seeds

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,840
if the pollen from the male plant

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,118
is received by the female flower here

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
and these are looking at the pre-flower

43
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,000
determinations

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,240
and again it'll be another video going

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,280
over the details identifying those both

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,280
uh in images as well as in the field

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,719
so what if we get feminized seed and a

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,079
lot of growers were buying feminized

49
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,840
seed and they think this is great enough

50
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,599
to worry about male plants

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
so do you really need to id plants if

52
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,399
you start with feminized seed well

53
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,919
without a doubt i would say

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,560
yes even if the seed is 99

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,478
uh feminized the seeds are female it

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
still means one out of a hundred

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,159
will be male or a hundred out of ten

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
thousand plants will be male

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,439
so depending on how much scale you're

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,159
growing that can have a

61
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,000
great impact so in large growing field

62
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,240
it's very important once

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,519
as once one male plant can produce high

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,039
amounts of pollen

65
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,118
and reduce the productivity of female

66
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
plants drastically now if you're only

67
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,120
growing five

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,039
six seeds like a 99 chance odds are

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
you're going to have mostly female seeds

70
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,199
but still wise to go through

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,760
and be able to recognize what a male

72
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,598
plant male flowers look like

73
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,280
so in our large growing areas our

74
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,439
operations the large

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
plant production facilities flower

76
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,239
division is

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,759
very important as one male can

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,719
contaminate the female plants but

79
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,479
contaminating quotes because it's

80
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,919
basically just producing pollen

81
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,799
which will cause those females to

82
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,399
produce seeds and not cannabinoids

83
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
repeated walking the fields is important

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
to be sure to catch the males as soon as

85
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,878
they can visually be identified

86
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,560
there is some time they don't

87
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,919
immediately just produce pollen there is

88
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,159
some time to catch those

89
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,518
male flowers before they will produce

90
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,199
pollen that will be exposed to the

91
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
environment and potentially pollinate

92
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,839
neighboring female plants

93
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,360
for indoor operations a one male plant

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,039
in indoor operations can quickly spread

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
pollen especially via ventilation

96
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,199
systems and that's why it should be

97
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,439
removed

98
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,560
very quickly amongst identification

99
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,199
because it's pretty much a closed

100
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
environment

101
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,039
can spread that pollen very quickly now

102
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,120
for clones

103
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,878
ideally with clones they should all be

104
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
of known ideally female

105
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,598
gender however in some cases there can

106
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
be an odd male plants and knowing the

107
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,878
difference is still important

108
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
in this case the producer of the clone

109
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,840
should be contacted to inform them that

110
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,039
your identification

111
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,439
since it's not what you would be

112
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,598
expecting buying clones you're expecting

113
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,519
female plants and 100 female plants at

114
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,439
that good to let the producer know if

115
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
you did get a rogue mail

116
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,519
just as good practice because odds are

117
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
that might show that might be some

118
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
confusion

119
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
in their cloning practices may have want

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
to reverted back but for the most part

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,400
clones you're expecting

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
to get 100 female plants
