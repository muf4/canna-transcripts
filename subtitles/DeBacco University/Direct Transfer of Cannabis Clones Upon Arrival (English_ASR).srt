00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,639
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,359
when we go over directly transferring

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,199
your canvas clones upon arrival to both

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,000
outdoor as we see the image here as well

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,000
as indoor situations

6
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:20,160
[Music]

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
all right now that you've got those

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
clones let's go through the transfer

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,959
process once they arrive

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,480
so first off when clones first arrive

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,320
you want to be sure to inspect the

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,760
clones make sure they're in good shape

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
and can handle

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
any transfer stress that they'll be

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
going through and this can be a very

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
efficient method typically you're

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,040
inspecting the tops of the plants as

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,039
well as pulling a couple samples out and

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,558
also inspecting the roots don't be

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,039
fearful some of the lower leaves are

21
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,799
kind of yellow or off in coloration that

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,320
can simply be because of if they were

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,919
packaged or grown together really

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
closely they might be getting enough

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
light that's fine but a good root

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,359
structure and a good top growing point

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
are all good things indicating that

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,558
those clones will be able to survive the

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,479
transfer process and grow into

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,679
full-sized plants

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,280
you want to make sure the clones again

32
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,319
have those quality roots so what are you

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
know when you're looking at quality

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,000
roots if the roots are not fully

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
developed this would be a reason to

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,118
potentially hold off directly

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,959
transferring your clones to the grow

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,478
site so if you have only a couple routes

39
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,640
coming out or routes that are kind of

40
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,400
weakly established might want to hold on

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
to them on an indoor environment before

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
you go through and transfer them to the

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,920
outdoor environment or hold them in a

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,240
propagation environment before they go

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,920
into a vegetative

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,118
stage of a grow tent it's gonna be a

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,680
little bit more stress for them you can

48
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,000
hopefully ease that transition get them

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,400
ready before they make that jump to the

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,078
next stage of development

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,118
now if we're growing outdoors weather

52
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,719
can influence how the direct transfer is

53
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,040
or when you go about that direct

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,640
transfer now transitioning plants from

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,960
the initial arrival to an outdoor

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,200
growing location may be best on a cool

57
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,599
and cloudy day this will help reduce the

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
overall stress the initial planting day

59
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,039
so if i was looking at this kind of

60
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,559
weather forecast looking at right here

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
we see some rain it would be good for an

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,240
outdoor location got to get the ground

63
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,839
saturated couple days of drying and

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,839
warming up that soil and then these

65
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,640
partly cloudy days would be great days

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,200
to transfer it followed by showers this

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,279
will help ease that transition of your

68
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,519
newly arrived clones

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,199
and this is all part of the process of

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
easing that transition so you don't want

71
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,199
to panic there's some color changes when

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,439
you make that transfer both outdoors or

73
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,359
indoor situations stems may even turn

74
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,280
purple indicating initial transplant

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
stress but especially if planting in an

76
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,360
outdoor environment don't take this into

77
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,878
a major reason for concern

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
those plants are just making that

79
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,719
adjustment to your growing environment a

80
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000
lot of times that purple coloration will

81
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000
go away the plants will start to

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,120
establish themselves and that will all

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
be just a history in the past now if

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,480
you're in an indoor location

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,840
it's a little bit easier because you

86
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,359
want to watch the initial light

87
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
intensities to reduce the chance of

88
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,840
burning your tender plants leaves so you

89
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,680
have a lot more control over that the

90
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,759
lights are not dimmable simply putting

91
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,519
the shade netting between the plants and

92
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,120
the lights can work

93
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,039
that thin little sheet can help reduce

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,560
the chance of leaf damage or if you have

95
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,400
a taller grow tent you can bring the

96
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
lights up so they're further away as

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
well

98
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
keep any materials closer to the plants

99
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,598
and the lights to avoid the chance of

100
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,878
fire so again if you're looking at

101
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,399
putting shade netting you don't want to

102
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,840
drape it over your lighting structure

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
you may want to put it just above or

104
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,959
support it just above your plants to

105
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,200
reduce the chance of anything catching

106
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,280
on fire so you have a nice safe growing

107
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,839
environment for both the plants as well

108
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,840
as yourself and surrounding environment
