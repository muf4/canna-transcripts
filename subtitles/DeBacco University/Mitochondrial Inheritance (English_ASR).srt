1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,679
you maybe remember wild app talking

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,099
about mitochondria and the fact that

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,750
they do contain some of their own DNA so

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,690
if we're talking about inheritance in

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,370
inheriting genes which is DNA we've kind

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,480
of touched on the mitochondria we can't

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,349
forget about them

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,589
well it may not be a large portion of

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:25,439
DNA that we get from mitochondria it is

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,140
still a portion and then that must be

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,849
taken into consideration so extra

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,199
chromosome or mitochondrial inheritance

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,509
some genes are actually in the

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,420
mitochondria all mitochondrial genes are

15
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,890
transmitted only by the mother meaning

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,189
all of the mitochondria that you've

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,100
received come from the your mother come

18
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,140
from the female side unusual muscle

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,750
disorders and neurological problems have

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,609
been linked these particular genes so

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,519
this means if the mother's affected all

22
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,469
of the children will be affected if the

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,960
father's affected all the children will

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,960
be unaffected because you get your

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,280
mitochondria from your mother so because

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,049
of this if the mother country come from

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,000
mom even though you get all your

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,880
mitochondria from your mom you may not

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,409
always get a mutated mitochondria well

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,859
how this is possible kind of involves

31
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,799
the dice here what kind of roll the dice

32
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:18,900
depends on what percentage of

33
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,220
mitochondria mom hasn't mutated so look

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,500
at this is kind of a good summary here

35
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,179
so we have our mitochondria in our

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,188
mother the mother with no symptoms but

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,340
we have some mutated mitochondria well

38
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:31,158
the number of mitochondria well some of

39
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,920
those are transferred to the mature egg

40
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,079
so if you're unlucky then you get a high

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,790
percentage of the mutated ones we have

42
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,699
up to 80% of mutated mitochondria in the

43
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,590
egg which will result in the offspring

44
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,409
having that percentage or if you're a

45
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,090
little luckier you get half-and-half or

46
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:54,299
even a little bit more lucky you only

47
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,118
get kind of 20% let mutated and the

48
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,950
sperm contributes no mitochondria only

49
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,569
comes from the mother so child with

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,710
severe disease potentially if there's

51
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,019
80% mutated

52
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,839
try to get a mild disease if it's 50%

53
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,538
which I have no disease or very little

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,509
signs of disease if only 20% are mutated

55
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,530
so this is how 20% mitochondria for mom

56
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,169
I like

57
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,750
your odds meaning depends on which ones

58
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,789
you get all those 20% you could get some

59
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,250
they're all 100% clean or in this case

60
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:25,409
you get 80% of the mutated ones so this

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,740
is where a luck or unlock the draw comes

62
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,419
into play but all of your mitochondria

63
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,050
good better and different you can blame

64
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,049
your mother for that
