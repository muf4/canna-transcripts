1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,370
so this is intended to be a very brief

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,040
overview of closed synthesis which is a

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,900
very complex process try to break it

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,839
down to the most basic and simple terms

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,699
here now this picture is basic as I can

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,710
make it where we have a plant receiving

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,809
sunlight carbon dioxide from the

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,390
atmosphere water being absorbed through

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,268
the roots and as a result it's producing

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,539
oxygen and also sugar molecules here

11
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:29,368
this is the chemical kind of equation

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,920
here we're look at this in just a little

13
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,750
bit more detail so here's a little

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,640
different representation of that the

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,670
plants taking in carbon dioxide from the

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,590
air in the atmosphere specifically h2o

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,660
or water being absorbed in the roots and

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,609
root hairs specifically this is

19
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,439
occurring in the presence of light which

20
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,679
is allowing the chlorophyll in the leaf

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,530
to synthesize carbohydrates a sugar

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,198
molecule in releasing oxygen back into

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,510
the atmosphere now while we think about

24
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,519
this occurring with terrestrial plants

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,259
which is is very important also can't

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,989
forget about the oceans and the plankton

27
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,060
on it's occurring they're producing

28
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,978
basically half of the amount of oxygen

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,710
that we need to breathe now you'll

30
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,780
notice also in this picture ATP Calvin

31
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,728
cycle light reactions we're not going to

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,769
get into details for this lecture is a

33
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,219
very complex process I'm just going over

34
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:23,099
a very basic overview this is the

35
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,719
general equation so most of this is

36
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,969
producing sugar

37
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,548
it's just glucose and oxygen as

38
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,798
byproducts it's taking in carbon dioxide

39
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,140
and water and using light energy to

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,180
assemble these so if you can familiarize

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,759
yourself with this basic equation of

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,280
flow synthesis hopefully gains a little

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,069
bit greater appreciation for the

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,868
complexities of this process that plants

45
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,398
are going through allowing us to have

46
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:49,399
the oxygen that we need to breathe
