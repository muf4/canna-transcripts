well so first off

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
as a retail sales person a lot of retail

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,920
sales are asking can i buy or sell

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
products with delta 8 thc or delta 10

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,118
thc

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
and specifically this question asked in

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,680
connecticut today

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,200
well the short answer is just simply no

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,960
you may not sell any product that

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
exceeds 0.3

39
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,679
thc on a dry weight basis these products

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,920
are considered cannabis and can be

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
only sold in the adult use market by a

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,719
licensed retailer

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
sales of cannabis products from a

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,319
licensed retailers are not expected to

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,960
begin in connecticut until late

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,158
2021. it was very recently adopting a

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,359
recreational program

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,439
but here we can see some of the details

49
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,840
as far as dates and times

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,199
aren't necessarily just because that law

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,840
was accepted and

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
is now setting in to affect things but

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
there

54
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,280
may not be happening as quickly as some

55
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,798
people had thought

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
if your product label states the total

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
thc or thc content of

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
less than 0.3 on a dry weight basis your

59
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,319
product likely complies with the law and

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,879
i stress the word

61
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,639
likely complies with the law here if the

62
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,920
label does not clearly specify the total

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
thc content

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,759
or you are unsure contact the

65
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,199
manufacturer named on the label to

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840
confirm the product has

67
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,119
less than 0.3 percent total thc on a dry

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
weight basis

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,319
delta products with thc content greater

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,080
than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis

71
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,639
will still be available to patients in

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
the medical marijuana program

73
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,799
at their approved dispensary facilities

74
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,079
it's just a little important distinction

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,400
to make right there another question

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,400
come that comes up is when purchasing

77
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,319
new products to sell in my store

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,680
how do i determine if they're legal

79
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:38,799
under the new law

80
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,239
so you want to check the label or

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,239
confirm with the manufacturer that the

82
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
product satisfies the 0.3

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,439
dry weight thc limit that's kind of the

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
number one there

85
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,800
for any product that does not meet that

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,720
0.3 percent

87
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
uh dry weight thc limit contact the

88
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,000
distributor or manufacturer to try and

89
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
cancel or return the sale

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,598
because that it would not be legal for

91
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,560
you to go through and

92
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,318
sell and distribute can i give my

93
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
inventory of delta eight products if

94
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,719
they have

95
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,319
uh i'm sorry can i give away my

96
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,560
inventory of delta 8 products if they

97
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,639
have no more than 0.3

98
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,719
thc and a dry weight basis another

99
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,719
question and again very simple answer

100
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,919
no the definition of sale under the

101
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,639
adult use cannabis and control

102
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,559
substances

103
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,158
law includes transfer without

104
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,318
compensation so no you can't just

105
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,359
give it away and give it as free that

106
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,878
doesn't count

107
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,959
it is illegal to give away delta 8

108
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,359
products as they have more than 0.3

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,039
thc on a dry weight basis in the state

110
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,720
of connecticut so be aware of that

111
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,840
so can i sell products labeled with less

112
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,680
than 0.3 percent thc without a license

113
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
well if your product label states the

114
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,200
total thc or thc content

115
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
less than that 0.3 percent on a dry

116
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,839
weight basis your

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
product likely complies with the law and

118
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
again likely contact the manufacturer on

119
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,680
the label to confirm that the thc

120
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,200
content is less than 0.3 percent on a

121
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
dry weight basis again looking at the

122
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,518
label

123
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,759
contact and manufacture all things you

124
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,879
should be doing anyway

125
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,359
are there packaging or labeling

126
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,039
standards for cbd and legal delta

127
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,840
products against focusing here

128
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,840
specifically

129
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
within the state of connecticut and for

130
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,799
products below 0.3 percent

131
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,559
dry weight of thc limit all federal and

132
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
state laws concerning labeling and

133
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,839
packaging

134
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
still apply to any food drugs dietary

135
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,119
supplements such as connecticut food

136
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,800
drug and cosmetics act states

137
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,399
i'm interested in starting a business or

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
working in the industry how can i

139
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,599
participate this is a lot of

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,079
people want to participate in this new

141
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
and emerging kind of industry

142
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,599
connecticut's marijuana market got some

143
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
good information here again showing a

144
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
lot of

145
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
positive aspects from revenue and this

146
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,879
is where a lot of people are considering

147
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
getting started in this

148
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,519
so more information on starting canvas

149
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,639
business will be coming from the

150
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,039
department of consumer protection

151
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,879
because

152
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,400
the recreational program is very

153
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,918
recently adopted

154
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,439
which will be responsible for licensing

155
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,799
any new businesses

156
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,399
given the anticipated volume of

157
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,240
applicants the department will conduct

158
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,918
periodic lotteries to determine which

159
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,759
applicants to consider first

160
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,918
these liars are expected to continue for

161
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
at least the first few years of the

162
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,918
market we'll get into a little bit more

163
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
of that detail

164
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,918
here half the licenses will be reserved

165
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
for social equity applicants which are

166
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,879
businesses

167
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,839
that are 65 owned and controlled by

168
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,719
individuals

169
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,038
who lived for five of the last 10 years

170
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,400
or

171
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:21,519
nine of their first 18 years of life in

172
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,359
a disproportionately impacted area and

173
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,279
have an average household income

174
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
of less than 300 percent of the state's

175
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,119
medium household income

176
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,879
over the last three years this is kind

177
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,600
of a constituent that was put in there

178
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,879
in the sense that trying to allow uh

179
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
people may not have had initial

180
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,360
advantage to the market

181
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
to allow them to have half of the

182
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,560
licenses will be reserved for those

183
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,758
particular applicants

184
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,519
you may find more information about

185
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,199
licensing costs and lottery process in

186
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,319
other articles we'll cover some of that

187
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,600
here

188
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,439
so what are the license fees that's like

189
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
the next obvious question is okay i have

190
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,120
a license what are the fees

191
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
there's a fee variability so be sure to

192
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,000
know what you're getting into

193
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
and this is looking at if you're the

194
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,319
non-social equity fees

195
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,439
or the social equity fees if you want a

196
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
cultivator

197
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,240
micro cultivator retailer product

198
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,478
manufacturer bud and beverage

199
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,439
delivery transport product packager or

200
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,120
hybrid there

201
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,879
we can see the lottery cost the

202
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,038
provisional and then the actual

203
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,159
license here being the most expensive

204
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,918
being a cultivator

205
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,759
with non-social equity fees is going to

206
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,959
be about 75

207
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,919
000 there the least expensive

208
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,359
would be the social equity fee category

209
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,478
for a micro cultivator

210
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,038
at 500 only 500 to find out more about

211
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,758
these

212
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,399
want to research within the laws of

213
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,680
connecticut

214
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,120
again this is just providing you with

215
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,360
that kind of a little bit of an idea at

216
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
least how connecticut's approaching it

217
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
so what's this lottery process we're

218
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
going to talk about applicants yes some

219
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
places

220
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,280
actually have gone through and it's

221
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
literally a lot of they put them in

222
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,038
there and they tumble them around and

223
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,720
pull one out uh connecticut the

224
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,240
department of consumer protection will

225
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
announce the total number of applicants

226
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
to be selected

227
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,439
and allocate fifty percent of them to

228
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,759
the social equity applicant lottery

229
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,199
an an application period for each

230
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,639
license type will be opened for a

231
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,400
specific period of time

232
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,840
to be determined by the department of

233
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,839
consumer protection

234
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,439
a list of all applicants received for

235
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,758
each lottery will be randomized and sent

236
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,598
to a third-party lottery processor

237
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,598
the third-party library processor will

238
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,519
randomize the list of applicants

239
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,038
and identify applicants selected through

240
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,799
the lottery process

241
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,038
the applicants will be reviewed and if

242
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,038
an applicant is denied the next

243
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,560
application in the list will then be

244
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,719
accepted until the total number of

245
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,759
applicants is selected or there are no

246
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
additional applicants

247
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,000
remaining these selected applicants will

248
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,560
have to complete provisional application

249
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,879
and submit

250
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,800
appropriate fees and the provisional

251
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,279
license has a 14 months to obtain

252
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
a full operational license there so keep

253
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,159
that in mind as

254
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,120
well we saw those previously as our

255
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
provisional versus our license here

256
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,160
so can i purchase hem products in a

257
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,759
dispensary facility without the medical

258
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,000
marijuana card and

259
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
very very clear and i think simple

260
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,240
answer is just

261
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,519
no nearly no more to say

262
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,960
other than that so how will cannabis be

263
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,719
taxed and this is part of the thing that

264
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,839
was holding it up a little bit from some

265
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,199
of the laws there

266
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,119
but there will be essentially three

267
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
taxes on retail sales cannabis

268
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,478
the state's usual six point three five

269
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,360
percent sales tax

270
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,120
a three percent uh sales tax dedicated

271
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,919
to the city or town where the sale

272
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
occurs

273
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,000
in a tax based on thc content that will

274
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,800
cost approximately

275
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,399
10 to 15 percent of the sale price in

276
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
total the tax rate is expected to be

277
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,158
approximately 20

278
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,759
of the retail price of cannabis in line

279
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,319
with the tax rates of a neighboring

280
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,759
state

281
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,839
massachusetts uh so lastly the

282
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,679
question is well when will retail sales

283
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,440
uh begin when we go through this process

284
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,159
well sales could begin in late

285
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,920
2022 in connecticut first the state

286
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,559
needs to form the new social equity

287
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,079
council

288
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,919
which will set guidance for adhering to

289
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
social equity provisions the state will

290
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,799
also need to hire new staff

291
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,879
issue new regulations and oversee

292
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,519
application and licensing processing

293
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,399
for new cannabis businesses further

294
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
these businesses

295
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,839
need to time to secure funding physical

296
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
locations

297
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,880
local zoning approval and all other

298
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,880
elements needed

299
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,919
to start a new business in a highly

300
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,200
regulated market

301
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,919
that simply just takes time the supply

302
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,080
chain must be

303
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,399
entirely licensed before sales can begin

304
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,000
and this includes stores testing labs

305
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
growers and there must be enough growing

306
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,879
capacity to supply the retail

307
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,399
market the governor the governor nick

308
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,799
lamont pictured here starting the actual

309
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,360
bill

310
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,039
has directed each state agency to work

311
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,919
to implement the law quickly

312
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,240
and in a responsible way so hopefully

313
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,919
this

314
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,519
goes into some of the details that you

315
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,599
might be wondering regarding retail

316
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,519
sales of cannabis in connecticut

317
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,519
at least current as of july 2021
