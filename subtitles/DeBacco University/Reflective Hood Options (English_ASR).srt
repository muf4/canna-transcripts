1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
something that I feel is often

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,569
overlooked by growers is the reflective

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,638
hood options or just reflect the hoods

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,190
in general for their artificial lighting

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:15,899
setups you can see here at double end in

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:18,210
here we have to 315 watt lights and here

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,460
we have a single-ended light all with

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,730
slightly different reflectors but the

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,500
whole goal is the same to help increase

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,929
the amount of light it hits the plants

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,609
and there's not lost

12
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,368
so these reflective hoods and this is a

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,989
single-ended one here the main goal is

14
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,090
to disperse light evenly across the

15
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,640
plant canopy and minimize that light

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,260
loss a proper reflector can increase the

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,329
growing footprint under the same light

18
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,089
compared if there was no reflector

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,399
utilized only about 40% of the light

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,520
goes directly from the bulb to the plant

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,799
so without reflector about 60% would be

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,390
quote lost and that sense of loss

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,878
wouldn't be hitting the plant wouldn't

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,189
be captured like a plant for the

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,988
photosynthetic process it's commonly

26
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,519
made from thin metal so be careful not

27
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:04,798
to damage them especially when you're

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,070
taking the light or they reflect are out

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,510
of the initial packaging well when

30
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,359
you're looking at a reflector you look

31
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,520
for the stated percent reflectivity so

32
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,680
reflectors leaving industry I've got

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,959
three here ones like the Vita ones by

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,840
sunlight supply and ones by demo locks

35
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,649
we want to have the higher percentage

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,689
what that means is you're gonna get a

37
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,368
better reflection so we can see this has

38
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,529
a greater reflection we're able to see

39
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:30,659
more of the detail here in this water

40
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,219
here we have a little bit lower beef

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,859
left if 'ti you're gonna see the same

42
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,599
general whether these spire is here

43
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,060
where the green light is it see it's a

44
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,978
much blurred image to be a lower degree

45
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,159
of reflectivity we have that higher

46
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:46,049
percentage indicating we're losing less

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,750
of the light that were paying for with

48
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,579
these artificial light setups now

49
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,739
cleaning the hoods clean these

50
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,148
reflectors new out-of-the-box reflectors

51
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,218
are through peak of efficiency in

52
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,468
communist be sure to clean the hoods to

53
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,259
ensure the reflectors are able to do

54
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,599
their job well and consistently over a

55
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,859
growing season or year be careful though

56
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,989
when you're cleaning them not to scratch

57
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,179
them because I could do more long-term

58
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,709
harm so if they do get dusty and they

59
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,479
will get a little tarnished in you dirty

60
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,450
I do want to make sure you go through

61
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,679
and clean them

62
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:17,488
but be careful what you clean them with

63
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,390
because you could do more damage

64
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,759
ultimately I want to replace the

65
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,500
reflectors could often be purchased

66
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,959
separately and these can increase the

67
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,330
light you sufficiency if clean is not

68
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,489
able the reflector or if it's reached

69
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,180
condition or it's beyond the ability to

70
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,489
be cleaned

71
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,860
a typical reflector life you're looking

72
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,170
at about two to four years four years is

73
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,480
kind of a max reflector before we want

74
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:42,219
to go through and replace that so a lot

75
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,169
of girls replacing bulbs every year

76
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,120
replacing the reflectors every other

77
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:47,919
year depending on your conditions you

78
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,480
might District to four years but that's

79
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,078
really the maximum you want to run any

80
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,759
reflective or enclosed reflective hoods

81
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,829
you want to utilize glass between the

82
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,479
plant and the lights we see here this

83
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,700
reduces the heat transfer from the bulb

84
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,768
to the plant I need to have the cooling

85
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,750
system air or sometimes liquid to help

86
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,909
regulate heat buildup so the bulb in our

87
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,199
bowels to not burn up you can see here

88
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:10,299
carbon filter pulling air through

89
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:13,119
cooling that light and then exhausting

90
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:14,920
it at the top here these air cooled

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,360
that's another would just saw this an

92
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,759
example of air cooled here's another

93
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,560
example this pulls air through ducting

94
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,780
to provide cooling in a sealed hood

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,269
system inexpensive and easy to operate

96
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,709
keep in mind the lights need a proper

97
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,049
temperature to operate and pulling in

98
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,180
cold air from the outside may not be the

99
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,469
best option particularly the north east

100
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,629
people think we're doing a good job in

101
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:36,519
the winter by pulling directly in cold

102
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,810
air well lights need to operate at

103
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,789
certain temperatures you want to cool

104
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,639
them which I wanted to say chill them

105
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:44,919
and this glass or plastic here will seal

106
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,319
up to allow this to be a controlled

107
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,119
environment there's horizontal

108
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:51,189
reflective hoods we see with these two

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,349
overall the most efficient reflectors

110
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,150
that directs half of the light downward

111
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:57,430
towards the plant they didn't have a hot

112
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,500
spot directly below the light sometimes

113
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,439
as we see here there's also additional

114
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,469
reflectors plate in place and this helps

115
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,780
reduce the kind of the bulb on hot spots

116
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:10,419
and we kind of increases reflectivity

117
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,449
even more to prevent the potential for

118
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,590
burning the plants below there's also

119
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,779
vertical reflector hoods

120
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,090
these bulbs are hung vertically which is

121
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,819
less efficient as a light has to travel

122
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,918
further before being reflected remember

123
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:25,449
that universe square law so we're going

124
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,949
to keep those bulbs as close to the

125
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:29,019
plant as possible without

126
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,639
burning them companies with parabolic

127
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,829
reflectors they can act like an umbrella

128
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,539
to help direct light I present like the

129
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,509
vertical mounting even though this can

130
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,850
increase mobile life you know quite get

131
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,949
as great of the mount reflecting to the

132
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,840
plant so you are losing some and just a

133
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,899
general inefficiency of the mounting of

134
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,310
the direction of the bulb open any

135
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:50,199
reflective hoods that we see here allow

136
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,620
for extra airflow reduce a chance of

137
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:57,759
overheating aluminum will transfer heat

138
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,959
more efficiently but Steel's often more

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,420
efficiently I should say that its deal

140
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,579
but often will increase the cost this

141
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,860
steel a little bit cheaper than aluminum

142
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,189
but you got a way kind of what you're

143
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,290
using and some companies are making

144
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:12,879
aluminum very efficiently and they're

145
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,270
able to transfer those out at a much

146
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,800
reduced cost lastly if you don't use

147
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,959
reflector and just go with and they can

148
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,000
bulb as we see here not usually

149
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,579
fluttering at all this allows the lights

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,290
bulbs to run cooler as a result the

151
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,019
bulbs to be suspending the plants to

152
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,879
take advantage of the 360 degrees of

153
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:33,699
light being admitted because if you

154
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,469
mount above the plants which it's not

155
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,289
advised this can increase the risk of

156
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,690
damage to the bulb and also increase the

157
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,510
amount of light loss would be about 60%

158
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:45,129
when a reflector is not used this is why

159
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,959
it's advised to use not only a new

160
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:49,930
reflector but when you're changing out

161
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:53,229
about every two three at max four years

162
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,780
so you're maximizing the light that

163
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,980
you're paying for to hit the plant to be

164
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:59,819
able to use for the photosynthetic

165
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,819
process
