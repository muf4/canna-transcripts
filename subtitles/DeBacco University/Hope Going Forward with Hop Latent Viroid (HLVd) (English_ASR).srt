1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,200
so on this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,179
going to go over the Hope going forward

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,039
with hops light and viroid it's been a

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,959
lot of Doom and Gloom try to give some

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,939
positivity here and give you an

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,700
indication of where this viroid might be

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,699
trending within the industry

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,559
[Music]

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,439
all right so let's go over the Hope

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,299
going forward with hop Layton viroid now

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,159
question a lot of Growers are asking is

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,079
it getting worse and honestly it's hard

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,759
to tell how to help the viroid is

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,079
actually spreading or if the awareness

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,000
is actually spreading and that's

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,039
resulting in more Growers looking for

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,140
this thyroid and actually identifying it

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,939
and finding it so are we on an upward

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,799
Trend are we on a downward Trend it's

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,079
really hard to tell we do have more

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,299
people looking for it and it is quite

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,799
prevalent and so that doesn't

23
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,000
necessarily mean it's getting worse it

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,038
means we're just identifying something

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,558
that's we that was already there before

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,899
we're even screening for it and again

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,640
stress is the point of testing screening

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,400
and actually looking for it not just

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,319
turning a blind eye to this

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,540
uh so why should I be concerned as a

31
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,938
grower well it reduces yields so that's

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,380
kind of a concern and if that's not

33
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,839
enough of a you know reason to be

34
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,420
concerned the pathogen does easily

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,978
spread uh so that is another concern to

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,439
both your operation as well as others

37
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,478
and there is no cure for this as well

38
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,399
this is why we need to be mindful of

39
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,500
this test for this and cull those plants

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,180
out as soon as possible so we're not

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,000
creating more of a problem

42
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,979
now being aware is the key part and that

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,959
comes through testing you want to know

44
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,118
what to look for and not be afraid to

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,339
test your plants don't think uh I don't

46
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,340
think that's hoplite Environ test to you

47
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,780
that you have uh to know whether it is

48
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,439
Apple and diet or something else

49
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,879
carefully tell others because if you

50
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,919
think their plants might be infected or

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,959
showing symptoms encourage them also to

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,579
get their plants tested and that's again

53
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,519
if they're showing symptoms in the

54
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,618
leaves plants can also have high viroid

55
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,359
loads in the roots that will then lead

56
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,180
to Upper portions of the plant

57
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,758
exhibiting symptoms so be aware testing

58
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,679
is very important roots and leaves

59
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,019
should be tested early on in favor of

60
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,699
the roots older plants you can test the

61
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,959
leaves particularly the petioles is a

62
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,399
good area

63
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,140
now this does not mean if you test

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,599
positive you're an unclean grower you

65
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,818
know like the you saw with all the you

66
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,679
know unclean all the leprosy all the

67
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,359
negative correlations with that if you

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,459
do have plants that test positive is not

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,580
indication of bad practices this is a

70
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,080
very prevalent uh viroid so it's more

71
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,640
important to test your plants and know

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,459
whether you have it so you can remove

73
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,979
and Implement protocols then it is turn

74
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,019
a blind eye to it and kind of spread it

75
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:46,079
to your operation as well as potentially

76
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,420
others uh operation as well

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,459
as again comes again with the value of

78
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,098
testing seed testing clone testing

79
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,420
asking for screening reports this is

80
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:57,060
really important if you're bringing

81
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,318
plants in do they get tested for hoplate

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,659
and thyroid you know do they have any

83
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,339
sort of documentation for that is it

84
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,139
something any new plants you get in you

85
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,280
should be testing your mother plants who

86
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,799
should be testing there's a lot of value

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,840
in this testing because that really

88
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,420
allows you identify plants early remove

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,459
of them and hopefully by discarding them

90
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,899
you're limiting the chance of it

91
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,840
spreading to many of your other plants

92
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,580
and hopefully saving your operation

93
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,319
now finding resisting cultivars this

94
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,360
would be a great thing to date no

95
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,060
cannabis cultivars are known to be

96
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,860
resistant to hoplite and virate some

97
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,539
aren't showing potentially what we call

98
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,659
tolerance meaning they're not as

99
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,939
severely affected but still coming to

100
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:38,579
this viroid however remember this is

101
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,359
still a new disease being identified and

102
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,340
more cultivars are now more cultivators

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,280
are aware of this and will be actively

104
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,400
seeking potentially having a resistant

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,259
variety to this but right now screening

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,879
and removing plants is the most

107
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,798
effective way

108
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,658
now sanitation protocols come along with

109
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,819
this be aware of your workers limit

110
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,318
contact with known infective plants know

111
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:03,598
who was around the infective plant

112
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,158
follow sanitation protocols or products

113
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,098
that actually work against hoplite and

114
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:10,739
thyroid alcohols do not work basically

115
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:12,419
your s and your bleach are really the

116
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,299
only two that really effective and

117
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,279
that's for surfaces and tools really

118
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,680
hard to clean the actual plant material

119
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,198
so keep that in mind resides in the sap

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,699
mainly and shows High viral reloads

121
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,560
early on in their Roots but then we'll

122
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,780
spread through the entire plant in only

123
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,418
about six weeks

124
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:32,819
lastly this is a problem but research is

125
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:35,159
ongoing so sharing of information both

126
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,079
at universities and also with companies

127
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,820
and getting more people aware doing

128
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,978
research on this is a way we can start

129
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:44,159
to understand this better and hopefully

130
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:46,439
find a way to reduce its spread to know

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,540
where it is to remove those plants and

132
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,100
eliminate this from the entire canvas

133
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,100
population going forward
