1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,439
so here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,679
we're going to be considering uh post

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,000
harvest cannabis plant disposal

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,519
as well as other supporting plant

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,919
materials required

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,439
when you're growing outdoors and how we

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,140
should best approach kind of

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,478
considering their disposal

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,478
[Music]

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,518
[Music]

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,879
looking at a pretty large scale outdoor

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,959
growing operation here

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,799
and looks like a lot of plants want to

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
be considerate of disposal of the plant

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,439
material as well as some of the

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,759
supporting plant material

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,799
in this example such as the plastic used

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,839
for weed block

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,238
as well as considering the support cages

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,800
as well as any irrigation or stakes they

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,878
also have utilizing this grow

22
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,320
so first off let's focus on disposal of

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,119
the plant material

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
per the epa cannabis waste must be made

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,479
un

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
unusable and unrecognizable before

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,759
disposal

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,759
mixed with at least 50 non-canvas waste

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,399
such as non-consumable solids

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,000
and stored in a secured waste receptacle

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,920
canvas waste can be disposed of in a

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
permanent landfill or through composting

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
incineration or by means of in-vessel

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,200
digestion

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
now landfills most campus growers and

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
processors are shipping chemist waste to

37
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,158
landfills

38
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,920
so this is why it's under federal

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,439
scrutiny composting

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
is the goal to provide optimum

41
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,359
conditions for microbial metabolism

42
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,719
to help that kind of breaking down of

43
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,159
the process there

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,640
of the plate material with the microbes

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,000
then there's incineration which must

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
occur at temperatures high enough to

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,599
destroy

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,600
the toxic organic components in the

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,000
hazardous waste as well as reduce the

50
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,559
overall

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,239
volume however with incineration note

52
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
that it is not the same as burning

53
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,438
leaves in your backyard it's a much more

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
controlled process

55
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,519
then speaking of controlled processes

56
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,078
the in-vessel digestion

57
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,438
is a more efficient method of composting

58
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,438
whereas the

59
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,798
waste is confined within a building

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,559
container or vesicle

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,240
in order to mechanically control airflow

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
temperature moisture as well as

63
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,000
odors this is just disposal of the

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,599
actual plant material

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,598
but there's also those plant supporting

66
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,598
materials we must consider

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,959
so for example we have to consider the

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,878
weed control

69
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,640
many times plastic or some form of row

70
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,239
cover is utilized in season but these

71
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,399
must be removed from the field

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,360
after harvest plastic is the most common

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
for many reasons

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
but one of the drawbacks of using

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,719
plastic is the end of the season

76
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,399
disposals we see that here

77
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,080
not only is a removal challenge but the

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,599
disposal can be even more

79
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
challenging there so getting out of the

80
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,439
field or out of the growing area

81
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
off to the side and removing it from

82
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,959
here can also present lots of challenges

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,639
biodegradable options do exist but often

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
they can leave feel trash and may still

85
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,359
need to be handled in some way

86
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,039
or tilled so again to be considerate of

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,480
what weed control options you are

88
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,719
utilizing

89
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,479
then there's the irrigation so if

90
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,479
utilizing drip irrigation this needs to

91
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,000
be cleaned up at the end of the season

92
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,679
many growers grow with one-time use

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
material it's only about four or six

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,719
mil that can be sufficient for a single

95
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
growing season

96
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,878
if you want to reuse the material and

97
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,039
this is referring to the drip tape

98
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,280
go with the 15 mil as if you take care

99
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,598
of it can be used for over seven years

100
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,039
again if it's handled properly might be

101
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,919
better suited for smaller growing

102
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,280
operations

103
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,359
larger growing operations that might be

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
utilizing plastic as well they might be

105
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
wrapping up the irrigation with the

106
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,238
plastic and disposing of it each and

107
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,479
every grow cycle

108
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,920
then lastly disposal the plant supports

109
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,479
so keep in mind that regardless of the

110
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,719
messy

111
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,359
method used plants often need some sort

112
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,598
of support a lot of wind outside

113
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
and a lot of other exposures some use

114
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,598
trellis netting or stakes

115
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,039
these can be reused in some cases but

116
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,639
it's more common with stakes

117
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,199
they will go through a soak of some kind

118
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,958
of sterilization before they're reused

119
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,399
using this kind of screen method this

120
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,439
can be kind of a

121
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,760
metal kettle fencing some growers

122
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,719
will utilize potentially concrete

123
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,479
supports

124
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,080
but keep in mind that don't just reuse

125
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,919
it from time to time

126
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,599
go through have a way of cleaning it

127
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,238
even if your plants didn't have any

128
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,759
disease

129
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
there's a chance it could be living on

130
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,719
your stakes could be living on your

131
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
trail standing support could be living

132
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,719
on

133
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
all your neighboring containers your

134
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,519
fencing be sure there's some form of

135
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,759
sterilization

136
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,438
process so that you're avoiding any

137
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,000
potential carry over

138
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,358
from one's growing season to the next

139
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,358
because particularly you can notice

140
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,638
disease comes in really early

141
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,000
on your plants even though you didn't

142
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,360
see it the year before because it's

143
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,240
living on the stakes living on the

144
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,319
support equipment

145
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
affecting early plants do yourself a

146
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,000
favor take that little extra time

147
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,479
clean up the things you're using from

148
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,439
year to year and ideally your plants as

149
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,719
well as your harvest

150
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,719
well thank you
