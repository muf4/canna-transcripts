1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,839
okay so while blood may have different

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
properties than water

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,439
i think this image kind of gives a good

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,440
idea of

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,359
what this is all about here we're

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,558
looking at cast off blood stain pattern

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,480
interpretation

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,320
think about it as we see the woman here

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,118
with her hair and the water

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,560
cast off how that may impact where the

11
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,559
blood is going to be found

12
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,599
and what pattern it's going to leave

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,118
when it impacts

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,000
a surface so first off wave cathode

15
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,920
cast off the tail of the elongance of

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,039
stain points in the direction of travel

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
so that's important there we're just

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,039
looking at determination

19
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,959
of where did that blood travel where's

20
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,039
where's the direction of its travel

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,480
the tail the wave cast off points back

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,878
to the parental

23
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,479
apparent drop i should say so our wave

24
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,039
casts off so here we see kind of that

25
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,359
angle

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,480
and impact where is it going where is it

27
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,759
traveling to

28
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,238
what type of pattern is that going to

29
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,839
leave and we see evident here so it kind

30
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,839
of gives that kind of walk through of

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
wave cathode is going to be moving in a

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
direction and that's what's going to

33
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,000
ultimately happen

34
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,519
and you're going to see kind of that was

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,079
the direction of

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
travel there and you could see the the

37
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,239
parent drop and the wave cast off here

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
again pointing in the direction of the

39
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,239
travel of that blood

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,319
can be very important when looking at a

41
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,959
crime scene you see it on a wall or a

42
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,399
ceiling

43
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,079
that can really help you determine the

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
direction

45
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,840
let's take an example of for example a

46
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,720
downswing of a hammer

47
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
where here we have a hammer and we have

48
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,319
a downswing

49
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,359
coming in contact the person's head here

50
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,519
and causing

51
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,879
pulling of blood and then we have the

52
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,959
hammer coming back

53
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,719
and as it comes back we're noticing this

54
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,078
is where the cast off of blood

55
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,438
is occurring so first we have the first

56
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,359
blow causing the bleeding

57
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,438
subsequent blows can contaminate the

58
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,920
weapon with blood the blood is cast off

59
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,639
tangentially to the arc of the upswing

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
uh or

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
backswing pattern in intensity depend on

62
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,118
the type of weapon the amount of blood

63
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,439
on the weapon

64
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,159
and the length of the arc as we can see

65
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
here

66
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,759
so again this is a great example seeing

67
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,118
how that is going to change how that

68
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,680
cast off is going to be found on the

69
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,159
ceiling

70
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,000
how that's going to determine the point

71
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,680
at which the impact occurred and

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,360
sadly where that victim was standing

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
the ceiling view so if we kind of look

74
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,599
at it as you look from the ceiling view

75
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,239
overhead swing of the of the blood metal

76
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,399
bar

77
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
we're looking here at that single kind

78
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
of pretty much a

79
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,439
inline pattern here and if you look

80
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,080
really closely we had to tell again the

81
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,280
direction

82
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
of that blood
