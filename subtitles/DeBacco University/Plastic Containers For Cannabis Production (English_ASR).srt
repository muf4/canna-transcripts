00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,480
so in this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,669
going to cover plastic containers for

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:13,839
cannabis production

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:15,439
[Music]

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,879
all right let's look more at plastic

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,320
containers here

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,879
so first off when we're looking at

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,039
plastic containers they're very popular

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,038
and they're popular for good reason

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
they're made in a wide variety of shapes

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
sizes and colors

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,399
the shapes are round or they could be

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,399
the square type

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,399
sizes it could be under a gallon to all

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,840
up to potentially 25 gallons or

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,558
sometimes even slightly greater than

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,719
that

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,320
in colors from a black pot to a white

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,120
pot and a whole bunch of colors

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
in between there are a lot of options

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,558
when you're looking at

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,799
plastic containers i would say the round

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,640
black pots tends to be the kind of the

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,238
most consistent the most popular

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,840
but there are other options that are

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,679
available now

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,079
the plastic is considered to be kind of

28
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,079
the standard as far as containers go

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,558
plastic containers are often the least

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,640
expensive they tend to be easy to use

31
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,239
and very simple to clean which is

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
contributing factors to why they're

33
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,319
considered to be the standard

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
they may not be currently kind of a

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,478
trendy kind of container to

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
use but they are still very effective

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,359
and they're still used quite on the

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
large scale

39
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,400
now the reasons why some people may not

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,239
like a

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
plastic container to utilize for their

42
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,000
growing area is that plants can become

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
root bound in plastic pots

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,078
due to minimal natural aeration because

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
of the impermeable

46
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,879
material there this will reduce the

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,239
plant's access to nutrients and also

48
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,000
water absorption

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,239
may even hinder the ability for the

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
plants to aerate themselves also

51
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,920
ensuring that the substrate has

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,399
natural porosity can help reduce the

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,640
negative impacts of plastic containers

54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
in the image we see here we see very

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
solid root mass here along the sides

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,759
however we don't see very many roots at

57
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,959
the very bottom

58
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,040
and we also see kind of where the

59
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,959
drainage hole was here right in this

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,479
vicinity here we see the sharp angles we

61
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,199
see kind of some discoloration to the

62
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:02,798
roots

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
so these are just important things to

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,280
keep in mind and while there might be

65
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,839
some

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
drawbacks these plastic pots are the

67
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,959
most popular

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,479
for good reason because of a lot of the

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
benefits that they bring

70
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,759
and a lot of the kind of the standard

71
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,479
process and also reusability in some

72
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,359
cases

73
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,878
to help reduce any sort of cost and help

74
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,879
maximize plant production
