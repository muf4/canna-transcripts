00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,359
this video here on debacle university is

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,318
going to focus

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,919
on explosion chemistry so looking at

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,000
that combustion

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,759
that occurs and results in this

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,519
explosion what are some different

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,440
examples of this

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,278
so starting with just chemistry of an

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,960
explosion in general

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,118
well essentially a combustion reaction

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,199
is very similar to that of a

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,960
fire the major difference though is the

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,960
speed of the reaction

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,080
damage is caused by rapidly expanding

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
gases in

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,039
a confined area so again there is still

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
a quote fire present but this combustion

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,000
means that there is definitely a speed

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,760
associated with this reaction as well

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,759
now the explosion is a sudden release of

21
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,320
chemical or mechanical energy caused by

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,238
an oxidation or decomposition reaction

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,878
that produces heat and rapid expansion

24
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,839
of gases here we may see it as like

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,679
a fourth of july fireworks for example

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
very controlled explosion and here we

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,119
see definitely a large fireball

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,878
indicating over a large area here now

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,878
there needs to be a reagent so the

30
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,599
reagent is a substance used to produce a

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,719
chemical

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,879
reaction to direct measure or produce

33
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,920
other substances there's kind of that

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,599
initially

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,519
starting substances we have reagents

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,359
also in various other

37
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,599
aspects of chemistry here we're looking

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,640
to produce that chemical reaction and

39
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,839
reagents can be quite

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,560
varied we're looking at a high

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
explosives so high explosives are

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,439
chemicals that oxidize extremely rapidly

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
producing

44
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,078
heat light and also a shock wave if you

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
look down here below me

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,078
you can clearly see the evidence of that

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,840
shock wave here

48
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,000
of the explosions occurring on this

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,960
battleship

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,438
these will explode even if not combined

51
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,599
so

52
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,078
keep in mind high explosives don't have

53
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,319
to necessarily be combined to produce

54
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,078
their end result again we capture that

55
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,078
nice image here you can definitely see

56
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,279
evidence of that shock wave that is

57
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,078
present

58
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,519
then we have our low explosives so keep

59
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,279
in mind low explosives are chemicals

60
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,679
that oxidize rapidly producing heat

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,439
light and a pressure wave look at kind

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
of that pressure wave these will explode

63
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,478
only when they are compressed or

64
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,280
confined

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,480
in an area there so slight differences

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,039
there from the

67
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,759
high explosives but again explosive

68
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,919
still

69
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,799
very dangerous and things to be

70
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,878
considered

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
when we're doing an investigation
