1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,400
on this tobacco University video I'm

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,400
going to cover cannabis pherology an

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,440
investigation of the past and also the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
present now virology is not unique to

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,279
cannabis but we're going to dive into

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,320
some of the specifics for cannabis and

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,679
viruses that infect this particular

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,679
plant

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,939
[Music]

10
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,160
all right let's get into the Cannabis

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,618
virology investigation of the past and

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,179
present so first off there's this great

13
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,340
article I'm going to provide you the

14
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,539
link here it's a guide to Canvas

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,520
virology and I'm going to take some

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,019
excerpts from this and show you and

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,239
break it down but if you want the full

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,420
review of the full article Lincoln

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,159
citation is provided right here for you

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,559
so let's start off with just the basics

21
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,738
viral taxonomy Basics you know how we go

22
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,078
about the naming of viruses well virus

23
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,238
names may be recognized and are based on

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,820
actually the plant species it was first

25
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,859
detected in now keep in mind that this

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,899
does not mean that is the only plant

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,579
that the virus can affect a lot of

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,500
people think that your tobacco mosaic

29
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,079
virus they think it only affects tobacco

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,760
not the case this doesn't even mean it's

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,959
the most virulent in that plant it just

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
simply means that's where it was

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,699
discovered first but this does allow for

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,700
a relatively Easy System of

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,978
identification and classification

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,140
now realize that there are DNA viruses

37
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,280
and there also are RNA viruses there's

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,159
actually single stranded and

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,599
double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses and

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,040
there's different morphologies to the

41
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,959
structures as well

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,220
now looking at these kind of taxonomy

43
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,679
just in general we're talking about

44
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,200
viruses discovering a virus and naming

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,439
it may seem like a standard process but

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,540
it is increasing in complexity now the

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,699
reason why is the important due to the

48
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,799
exponentially increasing number of new

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,320
viruses discovered by Next Generation

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,600
sequencing methods this is what's

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,779
causing us to kind of relook at some old

52
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,239
virus names or we re-evaluate how we've

53
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,340
classified what viruses might be similar

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,780
to one another with these new methods

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,939
discovery that when applied to some

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,219
previously discovered viruses again may

57
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,019
lead to a change in classification which

58
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,520
of course can add to confusion if you

59
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,099
knew it by one name or one

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,260
classification that could go about and

61
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:19,339
change and this is not only for plant

62
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:21,419
viruses it's for all these small

63
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,739
molecules and organisms that we're

64
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,719
looking at and discovering as we learn

65
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,580
more about them we're figuring out well

66
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,439
maybe we should classify them in this

67
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,060
category so you just got to keep up with

68
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,259
the latest and keep up with the

69
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,360
literature

70
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,818
now reported virus and virus in cannabis

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,760
uh here these are some of the great uh

72
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:41,098
ways of classifying the family the genus

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,479
the virus The genome organization and

74
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,280
who reported it if you want kind of what

75
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,018
these numbers refer to for references

76
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,060
you'll have to go back to the source

77
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,980
article but this is a list of known

78
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,739
concerns for cannabis Growers when it

79
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,439
comes to viruses and viroids it acts as

80
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,239
a very great way of quickly being able

81
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,000
to go through and see if you identify a

82
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,019
virus should you be of concern may not

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,300
be so concerned with the genome

84
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,700
organization but the genus the virus you

85
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,360
could see potato virus Alfalfa mosaic

86
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:11,579
virus grape line pattern tobacco streak

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,920
virus and their respective abbreviations

88
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,379
as well we see quite a bit listed here

89
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,539
now but there are distinct Visual

90
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,340
Diagnosis when it comes to a virus they

91
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,500
do have some very unique Leaf structures

92
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,658
and these are a set of visual symptoms

93
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,818
often on the leaves you'll see them with

94
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,979
modeling a mosaic or wrinkling this is

95
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,839
probably an indication that plant has a

96
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,459
viral infection however you do want to

97
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,219
take it to the lab to screen for and

98
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,959
identify the exact type of virus

99
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,280
now why is knowing the virus important

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,378
and you're going to say well if there's

101
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,419
nothing really I can do as a grower why

102
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:43,979
would I bother getting it tested well

103
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,479
justification to go through the hassle

104
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,818
of getting a virus identified is

105
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,439
important to know how it may have gotten

106
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,539
there for example was it insects

107
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,400
vectored was it it can reside in the

108
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,859
soil what kind of are you dealing with

109
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,319
because knowing that residual uh maybe

110
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,060
what and also what the odds of it might

111
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,579
be transmitted in the seeds are all good

112
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,840
information to know as a grower and they

113
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,599
make these little quick little strips

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,280
called Amino strips taken to Labs you

115
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,560
can really quickly identify them they

116
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,239
can do screening and sometimes you may

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,459
think you have one virus but you may

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
actually have two viruses infecting the

119
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,418
plant simultaneously

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,379
so why is it knowing the virus important

121
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,639
well allows the grower to provide a plan

122
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:25,560
what you may have how can you better

123
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,478
develop a plan how can develop a plan of

124
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,620
this prevention going forward what are

125
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,939
you going to Target is it going to be

126
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,620
insect vectors is it going to be soil

127
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,699
board is it going to be nematodes

128
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,740
um it's going to be screening plant

129
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,139
material when it comes in this allows a

130
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,360
girl to better provide a plan

131
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,740
now has improved understanding so a

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,300
better understanding of viral vectors

133
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,939
and the Genome of the cannabis plant

134
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,000
also has resulted in the identification

135
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:50,399
of regulatory genes responsible for

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,339
valuable medical and agronomic physical

137
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,039
traits the crispr cast 9 can be used to

138
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:58,918
Target these genes editing just like

139
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,340
other agricultural crops and lead to the

140
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,799
expansion and proliferation of this uh

141
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,959
kind of understanding of the plant and

142
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,418
being able to really Target these

143
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,519
specific sequences

144
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:14,519
now there are threat levels of concern

145
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,560
so the authors of the article kind of

146
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,659
made this nice little flow chart here

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,399
with the virus infection proof

148
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,500
identification do you have lab

149
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,839
conditions real cultivation conditions

150
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,740
and go on from there and as a result

151
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,939
they dealt these levels a b c and d so

152
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,100
keep in mind that while there are many

153
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,740
viruses that can affect canvas they also

154
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,139
propose this kind of level

155
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,139
classification a being the highest then

156
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,280
going to be C and D being the lowest so

157
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,500
while most of the currently available

158
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,019
information is based on other crops

159
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,519
cannabis can still provide this console

160
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,959
provide a good starting point for

161
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,758
cannabis

162
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,079
note the following level descriptions

163
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,280
are direct quotes from the research

164
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,560
paper that I'm going to provide you with

165
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,379
in this graphical representation of the

166
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,740
categorization of virus infection based

167
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,180
on the level of proof and correlation to

168
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,620
symptoms

169
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,000
so let's start with the highest level

170
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,579
what are the ones who should be quote

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,620
most concerned about level a of the

172
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,719
classification includes viruses detected

173
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,660
in the field or Greenhouse conditions

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,419
toward which in epidemiological survey

175
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,240
is active these viruses can spread

176
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:23,459
horizontally by vector or by economic

177
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,400
propagation and have been associated

178
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,758
with significant yield losses in sativa

179
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,038
campus adiva as well as other

180
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,419
economically relevant crops now to freak

181
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,279
you out but these are kind of the ones

182
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,379
you want to be most concerned with we

183
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,000
can see a couple here populate and

184
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,399
vibrate which I'll be describing or have

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,740
descriptions in other videos beat curly

186
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,019
top virus and lettuce corrosis virus

187
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,840
these are the ones are classified at the

188
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,579
highest Threat Level for Cannabis sativa

189
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,560
going another level lower we've got

190
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,359
classification B we see the list does

191
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,579
get a little bit longer and this does

192
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,439
include viruses which no recent reports

193
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,240
of natural infection in open field or

194
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,519
Greenhouse plants are available but

195
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
whose ability to infect Cannabis sativa

196
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,680
and induced symptoms has been proven

197
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,418
through experimental inoculations and

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,060
protected environments in the table 2

199
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,859
provided most of these viruses are known

200
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,319
to possess a vector and other

201
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,879
well-studied and characterized crops but

202
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,900
these vectors have yet to be identified

203
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,939
in Cannabis sativa cultivation context

204
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,799
and see keep in mind as I mentioned in

205
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,019
other videos that when the virus name

206
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,300
doesn't necessarily correlate with

207
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,339
cannabis we have a raspberry ring spot

208
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,340
whereas cucumber mosaic virus potato

209
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:38,339
viruses remember those aware they were

210
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,198
the plant they were first identified in

211
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,939
Threat Level C so we're getting a little

212
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,560
lower here numbers of this level of

213
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,959
viruses detected and symptomatic

214
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,759
cannabis plants from fields or

215
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,359
greenhouses however none of these have

216
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,120
been inferred as virulence determinants

217
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,000
so today is impossible to Define them as

218
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,800
pathogenic or even asymptomatic so again

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,360
these are a little bit lower on that

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
threat level still something if you're

221
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,319
seeing something not looking right you

222
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,360
see one of these it gets screened for

223
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,759
Threat Level letter c

224
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,400
and then lastly the lowest level uh our

225
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,080
Threat Level D virus is detected both in

226
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,538
symptomatic and asymptomatic canvas

227
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,219
sativa characterized to this level no

228
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,560
correlation has been established between

229
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,259
viral infections and symptom development

230
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,699
whereas persistent infection and wide

231
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,520
distribution are the main

232
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,199
characteristics of these viral agents so

233
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,639
according to this criteria Level D

234
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,919
viruses should not be considered a

235
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,538
threat to chemist CTV production so

236
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,098
we're going to get a virus hopefully get

237
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,860
quote one of these if you are going to

238
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,778
get a virus this is the lowest level and

239
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,639
really aren't considered a threat to

240
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,439
cannabis plants

241
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,539
so that kind of grower friendly system

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
that they came up with is Threat Level

243
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,379
classification makes it easier for

244
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,879
cultivares to know well if they get a

245
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:53,220
virus and it's identified at what their

246
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,139
level of concern should be and also is

247
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,540
it possible to prevent it from occurring

248
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,059
in the future good information to have

249
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,559
the intention is to provide the key need

250
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,199
to know information to the cultivar

251
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,759
without the complexities of virology

252
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,560
that's that simple classification system

253
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,419
so again if you do have a plate you

254
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,699
think it's infected with a virus get it

255
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,620
screened get identified and then see

256
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,240
what level it matches up with and that

257
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,240
should match your level of concern
