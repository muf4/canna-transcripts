00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
in this tobacco university video we'll

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,359
go over should cannabis clones be

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,000
purchased locally or

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:17,278
shipped in cases where growers cannot

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,399
produce their own

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,000
all right let's give you some of the

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,000
advantages and disadvantages of

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,359
purchasing clones locally or having them

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,879
shipped in

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,480
so first off it's important to

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,559
understand that the end product

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
should be the same there can be some

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,278
variability but purchasing clones can

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
save you the need

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,280
to create a propagation environment so

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
if you're limited on space or time

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
purchasing starting clones can be

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,199
advantageous

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,039
ideally whether they're purchased

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
locally or shipped in

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,558
the end product should be the same but

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,759
there are some advantages and

23
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,159
disadvantages to each

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,199
each method so first off if we're

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,159
looking at purchasing

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
local clones what are some of the

27
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,759
advantages to that well typically you

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,679
can see the end product before

29
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,519
you shut out the money to purchase it so

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,960
that's a great advantage

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,480
they can have some strains that are good

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,520
fit for your area in the sense that

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,759
they're produced there

34
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
for a reason you can also get the clones

35
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,319
right when you need them you might be

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,039
able to call up the person

37
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,719
and go pick it up that morning when you

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
can plant that afternoon

39
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,478
so that can be another advantage of

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,478
purchasing your clones

41
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,920
locally however there's also some

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,239
disadvantages

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
in the sense that a lot of times local

44
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,640
producers mainly have a limited select

45
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
and

46
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,879
selection of plant strains you may not

47
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,719
be to get the one do grew last year

48
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,959
one that you know works well for you so

49
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,200
that can be again a disadvantage

50
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,640
of local clones or local producers of

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
clones

52
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,519
the shipping of clones well so what's

53
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,240
the advantage why would someone go

54
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,798
through and

55
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,319
you know bring in and ship in clones

56
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,360
well typically the reason why people are

57
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,639
going that route

58
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,799
is they have a larger selection of

59
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
strain options so because they can be

60
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,720
shipped in from anywhere they can

61
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
compare

62
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,359
different producers and get exactly what

63
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,919
they want or get some unique

64
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,280
different strains do some comparisons so

65
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
this is why some growers

66
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,680
do select to ship in their clones then

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,118
we also have the disadvantages

68
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,118
of purchasing clones elsewhere and

69
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,280
since that may only get to select a

70
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,038
shipping window of time and not an exact

71
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
date so just because the weather is nice

72
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,679
and perfect

73
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
they might be coming in on that standard

74
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
date you may not be able to change that

75
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
clones also may be smaller in size than

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,878
you would purchase locally due to the

77
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
restrictions on

78
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,598
shipping to try to keep things in the

79
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,120
small shipping boxes as possible

80
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,719
that may cause you to get some smaller

81
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
clones if you're getting them shipped in

82
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,840
versus purchased locally

83
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,919
and then also there's the damage may

84
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,680
occur during the transportation process

85
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,280
no matter how diligent the growers may

86
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
be to protect the clones that they are

87
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,919
shipping out

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
so that's some disadvantages of the

89
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,280
shipping in process

90
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,878
so again end result should be the same

91
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
but there's some advantages

92
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
and disadvantages of purchasing your

93
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,039
clones locally or shipping your clones

94
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,159
in

95
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,159
if you choose not to produce them

96
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,159
yourself
