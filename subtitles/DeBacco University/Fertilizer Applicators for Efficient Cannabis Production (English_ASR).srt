1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,198
watering your plants is often a

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
necessity

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,519
as well as adding fertilizer so

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,240
fertilizer applicators are going to be

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,799
gone over

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,798
in this tobacco university video to

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
improve your efficiency with cannabis

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,518
[Music]

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,279
all right let's go over fertilizer

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,399
applicators for efficient cannabis

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:27,920
production

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,198
so what are some of the options well

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
there's many options these are going to

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,000
be a few that will be covered

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,119
going to provide you with the pros and

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
cons of each as well as when you select

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,280
one

19
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,359
hopefully search this channel and you'll

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,960
be able to find a more detailed video on

21
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,479
that particular type

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,399
all of these though are intended to be

23
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,519
able to deliver nutrients to plants via

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
irrigation water

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
this is an efficient method since plants

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
will need to be irrigated anyway

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
irrigation with fertilizer can help

28
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,878
prevent deficiencies

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
we see venturis injectors piston pumps

30
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,920
pressurized tanks as well as a diluted

31
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,679
irrigation tank as all viable options

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,320
so first off looking at the venturi

33
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,040
injector well the advantages is low cost

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,478
it is water powered simple to use

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
calibrates while it's operating and

36
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,879
there's basically

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,118
no moving parts those are great

38
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,560
advantages to the venturing injector

39
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,239
however some of the disadvantages are

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,879
that pressure drop is created in the

41
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,239
system

42
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,158
so if you already have a low pressure

43
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,920
system this may not be the best option

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
and the calibration depends on the

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,400
chemical level in the tank and can

46
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,679
fluctuate

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,920
as your tank level changes then it gets

48
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,320
to piston pumps now piston pumps are

49
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,519
very precise they have linear

50
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,839
calibration

51
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,959
they can tolerate very high pressures

52
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
and the calibration is

53
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,118
independent of the pressure that they're

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,520
being exposed to so they offer a great

55
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,680
level of consistency these are probably

56
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,599
the most popular used in larger scale as

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,600
well as smaller scale operations

58
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,280
the disadvantages is that they do tend

59
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,319
to cost more compared to everything else

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,239
mentioned here

61
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,438
they may need to stop to adjust for

62
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,920
calibration

63
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,158
and the internal parts do wear out over

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,000
time and may need replacing

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,280
however when they are operational their

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,359
high precision

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,118
and ability to really dial in a nutrient

68
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,159
feeding program is why they are so

69
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,399
popular

70
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,359
then we get into pressurized tank mixing

71
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
and this is kind of the

72
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
middle cost range they're fairly easy to

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
operate the total chemical volume is

74
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
accurately controlled so those are all

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
great benefits

76
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,239
however the disadvantage is the pressure

77
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
differential is required and there's

78
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,200
variable chemical concentration provided

79
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,959
to the plants

80
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,318
they also cannot be calibrated for

81
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,159
consistent injection rate

82
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,439
so you're kind of having a little bit of

83
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,120
variability there

84
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,800
which might cause sometimes plants to

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,599
get over fertilized and some plants to

86
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
potentially become

87
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,479
under fertilized and then the last one

88
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,719
the most simple is looking at a

89
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,479
diluted irrigation tank so we're looking

90
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,400
at a diluted irrigation tank there's

91
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,598
really no need for equipment beyond

92
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
a water pump in a tank so that's why

93
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,039
this is

94
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,640
can be used provides growers to know

95
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,079
when fertilizer is added and what

96
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,598
concentration because if you're

97
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
adding x amount of fertilizer to the

98
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:59,759
tank and you're earring with that tank

99
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
water

100
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,878
then you know exactly what the plants

101
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,039
are getting it does

102
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,878
require a large tank equal the size of

103
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,158
the irrigation volume and sometimes as

104
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,479
we see in the picture here

105
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,399
multiple irrigation tanks it also does

106
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,959
not allow for concentrated mixes to be

107
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
used

108
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,158
you have to go through dilute and make

109
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
sure it's evenly distributed there

110
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,919
before you go on and irrigate so these

111
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:20,958
are some options here we're looking at

112
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,359
fertilizer

113
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,319
and adding it to the plants if you find

114
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
one that you really like

115
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,359
search this channel and hopefully you'll
