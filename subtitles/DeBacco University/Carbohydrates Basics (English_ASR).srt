1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
okay here I'm gonna provide a quick

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,990
overview of carbohydrate basics kind of

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,859
the general run-through even though we

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,879
may think of them as bread and pasta

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,189
we're looking at them a little bit more

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,769
from a molecular level here in this

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,710
presentation so first off copperheads

8
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:22,320
often referred to as sugars and there

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,850
they do fit that general category they

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,379
provide the building materials and

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,689
energy storage and this is why we

12
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,210
typically associate them with bread

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,329
because that is a pretty dense energy

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,219
storage food item their molecules that

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,859
contain carbon hydrogen oxygen that's

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,960
Rica they own carbohydrates a the key

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,719
part is they contain those elements but

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,969
they are in a 1 to 2 to 1 ratio

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,960
that's one carbon atom to two hydrogen's

20
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,058
to one oxygen and ratio that's it

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,469
defines them as carbohydrates there's

22
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,479
two main types they're simple and

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,198
there's complex and we're looking here

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,929
at some more complex ones in the image

25
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:03,329
with the bread and the pasta now looking

26
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:05,938
at comparing those simple and what

27
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,950
defines a simple carbohydrate well

28
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,529
simple carbohydrates are called

29
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,780
monosaccharides and disaccharides mono

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,150
meaning one one sugar saccharides

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,269
meaning sugar so one sugar make it means

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,790
it can they consist of one subunit you

33
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:23,699
may have heard of glucose or fructose or

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,740
galactose these are all monosaccharides

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,390
a little bit bigger here would be

36
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,129
disaccharide it's diabetes two

37
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,219
saccharides meaning sugar and they

38
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:35,578
consist of two subunits so for example

39
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,859
sucrose are two monomers that are linked

40
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,938
together it's like a lactose in a

41
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,228
glucose linked together we see here

42
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:45,349
lactose is actually two glucose

43
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,849
molecules linked together forming this

44
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:51,149
disaccharide both of these fall into the

45
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:52,438
category of simple carbohydrates as you

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,349
get a little bit further a little more

47
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,209
into the complex carbohydrates so a

48
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,359
complex carbohydrates consist of long

49
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:03,149
polymers of sugar subunits and poly

50
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,180
meaning many that could be three four to

51
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,859
hundreds literally as we can see here

52
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,890
polysaccharides many sugars linked

53
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,129
together they all consist of potentially

54
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,369
those monomer units that we saw

55
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:18,549
it's just many of them being linked

56
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,980
together making these complex

57
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,560
carbohydrates now here's just a quick

58
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,719
look at a monosaccharide disaccharide in

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,019
polysaccharide now monosaccharides just

60
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,789
as an example is glucose disaccharide

61
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,319
here we have sucrose again they're

62
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:35,150
linked together not just two

63
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,458
monosaccharides hanging out together

64
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,129
they're actually linked and the last one

65
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:42,709
down here is a polysaccharide and that's

66
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,489
amylose here you see many many of these

67
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,930
units linked together is the key part

68
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,969
now when we're looking at these complex

69
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,209
carbohydrates they fall into many

70
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:56,120
categories so for example we have starch

71
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,789
being an example now starch provides

72
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,709
energy storage in plants so it's

73
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:03,530
important energy storage molecule for

74
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,750
the plant world mikage in here provides

75
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,449
energy storage in animals so they're

76
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,340
both complex carbohydrates but there's

77
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,709
different forms for different organisms

78
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,289
cellulose is found in the plant walls as

79
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,750
it goes in there strength and rigidity

80
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:20,209
also high amounts of energy that we

81
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,549
don't really as humans not able to break

82
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,989
down all that well versus other animals

83
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,870
that have a more complex digestive

84
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,769
system are and chitin is found in cell

85
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,239
walls of fungi and in insects and

86
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,519
exoskeletons so here we have a blue crab

87
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,069
it has a lotta chitin in it it's a very

88
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,289
tense dense alder shell and that is a

89
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:40,818
carbohydrate but again we're typically

90
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:42,409
going after they meet on the inside

91
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:44,689
because we can slack the ability to

92
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:48,039
break down the great degree of

93
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:50,840
complexity of the cut units in the shell

94
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,638
now within these carbohydrates of a

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,259
function for energy we're out materials

96
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,569
energy storage structural components

97
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:59,419
it's a lot of ways that our body can

98
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:01,608
utilize and metabolize carbohydrates and

99
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,638
it is glucose as an example that's a

100
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:07,219
mono saccharide a single sugar starches

101
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,260
cellulose in glycogen our other examples

102
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,379
keep in mind that starch and says are

103
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:14,149
much more complex and we our digestive

104
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,829
system may have a harder time breaking

105
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,930
those down because they are so complex

106
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,990
getting into isomers so looking at the

107
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,199
different molecules and molecular

108
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,730
formulas here well when we're looking

109
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,409
carbohydrates this is actually these

110
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,460
same molecular formula so a lot of

111
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,720
people initially look at this and say oh

112
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:34,639
they're different lucky their formulas

113
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,240
are changing it's actually the same

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,669
molecular formula in other molecule but

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,280
has a different chemical structure so

116
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,250
it's the same formula same number of

117
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,869
atoms but organized in a different way

118
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,550
again they both have the same number of

119
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,470
atoms in each element but different

120
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,480
arrangements of those atoms we kind of

121
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,940
see that taking shape here where there

122
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,400
is this change there is this different

123
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:01,670
shape here again synonyms they're just

124
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:04,009
kind of jumbled in different ways now

125
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,680
structural isomers we see here and

126
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,939
butane isobutane and kind of the carbons

127
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,009
are kind of highlighted here in the

128
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:11,540
bright colors we can see that if you

129
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,060
count up the number of atoms are all the

130
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,990
same the same ratio but they look very

131
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,430
different they're structurally different

132
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,629
now getting to carbohydrates you start

133
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,019
talking about what's called sis and

134
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:26,029
trans this is systems for adjacent both

135
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,299
on the same side and trans is across

136
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,979
from so what makes this important is if

137
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,470
you start looking at things and I have a

138
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,900
couple examples here if you have a

139
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,100
molecule that only has a single bond in

140
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,959
the middle

141
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,870
well what that's going to cause is this

142
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,668
molecule can turn and spin and that's

143
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,040
not going to really lend itself to being

144
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:47,629
sis or trans if you look at these sis

145
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,480
and trans carbohydrates here a little

146
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:52,519
bit closer now you could see that over

147
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,640
here there's a double bond what that

148
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,799
double bond allows for is a fixed point

149
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,229
so it can't rotate like I just showed

150
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,569
you so here at a double bond we have

151
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,970
this this form so here's that double

152
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,649
bond and these carbon atoms and these

153
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,990
hydrogen atoms for example they really

154
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:11,418
they can't turn it could move slightly

155
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,629
here but they can't turn therefore we

156
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:16,339
have sis peak on the same side and we

157
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,990
also need that double bond here we can

158
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:19,699
see the difference but also that double

159
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,860
bond here for trans because again these

160
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,668
can't rotate so therefore we do have

161
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,949
them evident on either side here so it

162
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:31,699
should be the trans that form here so

163
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:33,409
again our transform and this would be

164
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,899
our sis form so if we're looking at

165
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,640
comparing to the pictures I have just

166
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,519
behind us this would be the transform

167
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,348
this would be the

168
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,620
forms they are I make myself a little

169
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:48,158
bit smaller we could see that how

170
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:52,720
clearly we can see that difference here

171
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:55,509
so again that transform being evident

172
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,479
here and that sis form located right

173
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,720
here so again that difference there all

174
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,240
because of that double bond fixing those

175
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,310
atoms in space again we have those

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,590
single bond causes an issue causes

177
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,829
spinning not gonna set up well for sis

178
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:14,739
or trans here now within our

179
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:16,300
nomenclature we have what's called D

180
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,870
glucose and L blue cows and that's

181
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,990
basically referring to the organization

182
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,759
of the hydroxide group here so we're

183
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,918
looking at sugar nomenclature for sugars

184
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,389
more than one chiral Center and I'll

185
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,250
talk about chiral centers in a second

186
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,259
it's a basically a carbon molecule with

187
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,029
four different atoms attached to it we

188
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,759
see the D and the L refers to the

189
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:39,279
asymmetric C that's the carbon from the

190
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,860
aldehyde or ketone group C an aldehyde

191
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,468
or a ketone looking at how these are

192
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,658
being arranged the most naturally

193
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:49,750
occurring sugars are the D isomers so

194
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:52,089
our bodies have enzymes are very

195
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,139
dependent on shape and that D glucose is

196
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,629
something our body might be able to

197
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,400
metabolize where that L glucose in we

198
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:00,668
may lack those enzymes to break that

199
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:03,189
down efficiently that chiral Center as I

200
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:04,990
mentioned molecules consist of at least

201
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,288
one carbon atom and foreign Donna

202
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,240
identical things attached to its

203
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:12,430
substituent's so this is allowing this

204
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,918
chiral this for different attachment

205
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,538
points allows her to be a kind of a left

206
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,908
side and a right side a difference

207
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:20,110
amongst those so that chiral Center is

208
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:23,098
that carbon with the four different

209
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,810
items attached to it optical isomers

210
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,339
mirror images are not the same so this

211
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,379
important correlation here these are

212
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,818
mirror images of one another but they're

213
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,168
not the same they're different

214
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,240
arrangement of the four different groups

215
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:37,208
around that Center atom that we see

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,889
located right here dnl sugars are mirror

217
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,259
images of one another they have the same

218
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:43,179
name d glucose and L glucose but

219
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:46,450
different enzymes would be required to

220
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,539
break those down well lastly here to

221
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,570
help prove that mirror images are not

222
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:53,528
the same your left and right hand are

223
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,749
not the same

224
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:58,659
of course they are well if you hold them

225
00:08:55,749 --> 00:09:00,790
up to one another here and you'll notice

226
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:03,219
that they don't match up if you do this

227
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:04,929
you say oh look now they match up well

228
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,509
ones facing one when one's facing the

229
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:09,039
other here you're seeing my palm here

230
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,889
seeing the back of my hands are not the

231
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,498
same orphan them to be identical need to

232
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:16,269
be able to be able to lay over one

233
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:18,699
another perfectly and you can see here

234
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,769
both at my hands the thumbs are not

235
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:22,748
matching up think about shaking

236
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:25,568
someone's hand for example that just

237
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:27,040
goes to prove that you know your left

238
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:29,919
and right hand while they all have the

239
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,659
same components are not identical copies

240
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,909
of one another they are mirror images

241
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:35,909
and that's a very important distinction
