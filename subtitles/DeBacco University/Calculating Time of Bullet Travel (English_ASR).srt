1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,599
this video lecture is going to be

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,919
looking at calculating the time

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,240
of bullet travel so what we think that

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,879
they may travel very fast which they do

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,160
we'll be able to calculate that time as

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,679
well as some of the distance and

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,199
velocity with the equation i'm going to

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
provide you with

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,399
so starting with time from the shooter

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,118
to the

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,599
target well the time equation is t

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,879
equals

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
d over v or

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,079
time which is represented by t in

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,800
seconds

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,678
equals distance d in meters over

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
velocity

18
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,960
in meters per second keep in mind that

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,359
the units must be

20
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,558
matching so in this example a distance

21
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,000
was measured in meters

22
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,439
so the velocity was in meters per second

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,439
and that allows us then to be able to

24
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,039
calculate the time

25
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,119
so looking at that same equation that

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,079
hasn't that doesn't change here

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,679
a simple example a bullet traveled in a

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,719
straight line we're assuming

29
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:00,079
30 meters and the velocity was

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,280
27 meters per second so the question is

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,159
what's the time that the bullet spent um

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,879
traveling that distance at that speed

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
well how long

34
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,158
did this take when we go through and

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,200
kind of calculate this out

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,520
the simplified example here how long did

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
it take will the answer be 1.1 seconds

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,438
and how did i get that

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,560
i take the distance which would be 30

40
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,599
and divide it by

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,400
27 and that would get you 1.1

42
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,919
seconds now continuing this same idea

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
and the same concept and the

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
exact same equation that provided you

45
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,000
with uh

46
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,280
right over right over here i give you

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,640
three examples

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,159
to work on this type of equation so what

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
is what is the time

50
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,079
of travel if the bullet goes 100 meters

51
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,239
at a rate of 540

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,919
meters per second second example is

53
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,478
what's the distance of travel

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
if the bullet was in the air for 1.5

55
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,118
seconds so i kind of give you a quote

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,960
t in this case traveling at 400 meters

57
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,718
per second that's the velocity so in

58
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,759
that case you need to solve for d

59
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,879
here you need to solve for v what is the

60
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,280
velocity

61
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,560
of travel if the bullet that was in the

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,239
air for 0.7 seconds and traveled at 25

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,400
and traveled 25 meters what was the

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
velocity so again this is just kind of

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
working with this equation

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,920
so just to pause the video here take a

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
piece of scrap paper out and solve for

68
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,878
these

69
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,639
i'm going to be revealing the answer so

70
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,159
hopefully you've solved for those or at

71
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,479
least this is a fair warning if you

72
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,680
don't want any of the answers quite yet

73
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,598
so here we have the answers provided and

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,480
this is provided up here and kind of a

75
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:37,439
breakdown of how i set up that equation

76
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,719
located below now those were kind of

77
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,239
basic examples

78
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,759
i've gone through here and i've

79
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
developed what i call challenge

80
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,199
examples and what makes them challenging

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
is not that the equations changed by any

82
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,359
means

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
you're still solving the same equation

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,480
for time distance and velocity

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,719
but here you may have to change the

86
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,280
units you use so for example here i give

87
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,199
you feet per second and i give you yards

88
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
here i give you miles per hour in

89
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,598
seconds and i'm looking for the velocity

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,919
if i'm giving you feet in seconds so

91
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,759
again this might require a little bit of

92
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,399
some unit conversions to keep in mind

93
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,639
there

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
um so this is what makes these a little

95
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,919
bit like challenge

96
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,599
examples so again pause the video here

97
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,878
solve them because i'm about to reveal

98
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,719
the answers

99
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,199
fair warning on revealing the answers

100
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,919
now and you could again see the answers

101
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,679
provided

102
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,919
as well with the kind of the basic

103
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,879
two-step potential conversions you may

104
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,798
need to do

105
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,399
hopefully you got these answers and able

106
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,599
to understand these kind of

107
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,480
basic ways for calculating time of the

108
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,479
bullet travel
