1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,359
so you want to add carbon dioxide to

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,359
your grow space

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,278
well there's a variety of sources of

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,359
that carbon monoxide that you can add

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,679
in here on debacle university i'll

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,678
provide you with some quick advantages

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,798
and disadvantages of each and then go

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,278
into more detail

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,879
on each of the sources described here in

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,850
other videos that can be found

11
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,018
on this channel

12

[Music]

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
all right let's get into sources of

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,159
carbon dioxide for cannabis plant

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:33,520
production

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,679
now just keep in mind that carbon

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
dioxide is a non-flammable colorless

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,039
odorless gas

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,000
it can be in a solid or liquid state or

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
gas estate

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
used across various industries including

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,920
welding food beverages manufacturing

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
as well as water treatment that's very

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,600
commonly found

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
now one of the options when we're

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
looking at enrichment we have compressed

27
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,919
bottles

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,679
the advantage of utilizing compressed

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,399
bottles are typically easy to get

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,399
they're easy to find at most grow shops

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,480
as well as many air suppliers

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,679
and they're also a pure form of carbon

33
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,679
dioxide meaning

34
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,799
just carbon dioxide is purified and

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,840
compressed in the bottle

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
you're not getting any sort of

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,118
by-products the disadvantage of using a

38
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,039
compressed bottle though

39
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,359
is the transport and or refilling of the

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,479
bottles can be a hassle especially as

41
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,759
you get to the larger

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,039
sizes so compressed bottles aren't

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,599
looking like something you want to

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,118
implement there is also a liquid carbon

45
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,079
dioxide to consider

46
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,078
now liquid carbon dioxide is a very

47
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,959
dense and pure form of carbon dioxide

48
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:32,798
it's one of the

49
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,239
densest purest forms it's a great great

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,840
source in that regards

51
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,839
however the disadvantage is it's

52
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
difficult to get and can require special

53
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
holding equipment

54
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,438
and refrigeration on site so typically

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
liquid carbon dioxide is

56
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,398
reserved for larger operations where

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,079
they need the density of carbon dioxide

58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,478
they don't want to store they want to

59
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,239
have limited storage areas but there are

60
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,840
additional equipments that that is

61
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,839
required

62
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079
now there's propane as a carbon dioxide

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
source now utilizing propane this can

64
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,599
also provide heat as a source when it's

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
burned it's going to give you some heat

66
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,000
and additionally enrich your area with

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
carbon dioxide

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
however the disadvantages is that this

69
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
will also increase humidity

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,480
and also potential byproducts of other

71
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,239
gases

72
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,598
also consider the questions what if heat

73
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,200
is not needed in your grow space

74
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,039
particularly in the summer

75
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,399
and what if the heat is only needed at

76
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,318
night or the lights off

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,239
period carbon dioxide can only

78
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,719
efficiently be utilized by plants during

79
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
the

80
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,598
lights on uh period or during the when

81
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
sunlight exposure occurs

82
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,719
so if you're adding carbon dioxide or

83
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
burning propane as heat then you're

84
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,159
adding carbon dioxide you are

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
but the plants really are not able to

86
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,519
take advantage of it

87
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
which can also cause considerations if

88
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,719
you're needing uh to supplement

89
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,360
carboxylate in the summer months

90
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,199
where heat is not needed and lastly

91
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
there are biological carbon dioxide

92
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,719
generation sources as well

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,479
the advantage is it's a passive form of

94
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,598
carbon carbon dioxide

95
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,598
generation tends to be pretty easy

96
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,158
uh the disadvantages though is it's an

97
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,839
incandescent inconsistent production

98
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,598
meaning these are biologically generated

99
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,640
so they're biological systems that need

100
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,399
to be

101
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,518
fed and they might produce more one day

102
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,879
and less another day and also

103
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,039
temperature dependent

104
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,479
it's also a not regulated form of carbon

105
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,679
dioxide meaning you could get a lot in

106
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,158
one area

107
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,959
and not a lot the next day so keep these

108
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,239
in mind

109
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,719
if you want to learn more about any of

110
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
them check out other videos on this

channel where you can learn more about

112
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
the details

113
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,878
to determine the best source of carbon

114
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
dioxide for your growing operation
