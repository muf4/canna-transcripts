00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,640
going to be looking at carbon dioxide

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,480
sensor placed below plant height

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,529
for cannabis production and how that

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,699
will impact the readings that you

6
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,699
[Music]

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
receive

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,320
if you're looking to place your carbon

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,159
dioxide sensor below the plant height

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
let's see what effects that will have on

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,960
your readings

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
first off you need to realize that

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,399
carbon dioxide is heavier than air

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
you can see here's a tank that had looks

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,520
looks like a liquid carbon dioxide had a

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,479
leak and we can see how it fills the

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,760
streets here

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,599
this carbon accident will naturally

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,719
accumulate at the bottom of a growing

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,520
area simply because

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
it's heavier than the air surrounding it

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
so

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
the sensor reading offset well when

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,359
placing a sensor below plant height

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,039
this will typically result in an

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,119
artificially higher reading

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,399
than the plants may be experiencing so

28
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,359
you need to keep this in mind if that's

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
where you're going to be mounting your

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,000
sensor

31
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,599
the readings that you get the sen the

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,238
controller is only as good as the sensor

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
placement

34
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,280
you'll get usually readings that are

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
artificially higher

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
than what the plant might be

37
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,118
experiencing and that's at the plant

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
height

39
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,560
leaf area so this why would you want to

40
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,079
uh

41
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
mount your sensor below plant height

42
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,679
well this is only beneficial

43
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
this type of sensor placement if the

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280
carbon dioxide injection point

45
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,359
is higher in the structure and you want

46
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,239
to get a read of what's passing by the

47
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,000
plants

48
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,000
meaning if you have your sensor down

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,359
here and you have your plants growing

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,799
and you have your injection point only

51
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,560
at the top and you want to get an idea

52
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,520
of how much carbon dioxide is going past

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,359
the plants

54
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,798
that's what your sensor is going to be

55
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,640
telling you

56
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,640
now i would suggest or just grow

57
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,719
suggestions is that

58
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
if this is the only mounting location

59
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,000
you have you may want to set the target

60
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,439
level a little higher

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,159
than the optimum simply point being to

62
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:51,839
take into a

63
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
into consideration the fact that they're

64
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
reading in this area of the growing

65
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,919
space

66
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,519
will typically be higher than what the

67
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
plants are experiencing

68
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,478
so aren't making it artificially a

69
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,039
little bit higher will ensure that the

70
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,599
plants

71
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,640
hopefully are getting the optimum level

72
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,359
which will be a little bit

73
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
under what your sensor or readout is

74
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,120
providing you

75
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
again i would only use this if this was

76
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,039
the only

77
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,280
location you could mount it for a

78
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,598
variety of reasons because you are going

79
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,520
to get that artificially high reading

80
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,519
with this sensor placement
