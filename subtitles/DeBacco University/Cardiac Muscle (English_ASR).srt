1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
okay here are we looking at cardiac

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,139
muscle now hopefully this is the first

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,500
one you're watching there's two others

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,239
on skeletal muscle and smooth muscle by

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,949
the end of watching all three of those

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
you hopefully can develop an

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,989
understanding for what makes each unique

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,149
and also where is each typically found

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,929
so this one's gonna focus on correct

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,219
muscle which is found in the heart

11
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:28,379
so our cardiac muscle it's composed of

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,348
chains of single cells each with its own

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,960
nucleus these chains are interconnected

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,520
forming a latticework

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,160
each heart cell is coupled to its

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,410
neighbors by a gap in junction so if you

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,199
remember from the skeletal system these

18
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,419
striations are found in both cardiac and

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,910
skeletal muscle however what makes

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,579
skeletal muscle here unique these kind

21
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:53,750
of little lines here so it's a zoomed in

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,730
version of that and what this is is an

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,219
intercalated disc this is allowing

24
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:03,119
electrical signals between cells to

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,790
occur we want our heart to contract at

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,069
you know regular intervals and these

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,830
help cause orderly pulsations of the

28
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,859
heart that electrical signal is able to

29
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:17,250
travel through these cardiac muscle

30
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,200
cells now the cardiac muscle is striated

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,478
muscle it's present only in the heart so

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,200
this is a very unique type of muscle

33
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,359
it's found only in the heart the fibers

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,868
have a single nucleus and are branched

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,728
and joined by one another by these

36
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:34,709
intercalated discs so that's a very

37
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,289
important and distinguishing factor of

38
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:40,969
cardiac muscle that makes it unique

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,450
compared to smooth and skeletal muscle

40
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:47,158
Lassa here these very important discs is

41
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,200
intercalated discs are part of the

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,200
cardiac muscle they contain gap

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,149
junctions of these desmosomes desmosomes

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,769
is a cell structure that anchors the

45
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,409
ends of the cardiac muscle fibers

46
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,840
together so the cells do not pull apart

47
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,390
during the stress of individual fibers

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,390
contracting so we could see a little bit

49
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,580
of an example here desmosomes are our

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,009
cell to cell junctions it's kind of

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,590
holding everything together remember

52
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,988
that we have cardiac muscle we might

53
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,840
Andreea located here here's an example

54
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,780
of our nucleus so be able to distinguish

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,030
our cardiac muscle compared to the other

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,800
two also keep in mind because we have

57
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,409
this rhythmic contractions in the heart

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,230
also have those regular electrical

59
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:34,439
impulses going through and ensuring our

60
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:37,369
heart has those nice regulated intervals

61
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,370
and pulsations
