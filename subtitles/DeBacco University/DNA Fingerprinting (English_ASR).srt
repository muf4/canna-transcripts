1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
okay DNA fingerprinting as the name

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:07,950
implies is a unique look to DNA in this

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,929
case the fragments as you can see on the

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,960
screen it looks like of course I touched

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,870
the screen there and it's big

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,310
fingerprint here but we'll clean that up

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:22,230
a little bit later looking here at

8
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:24,149
deciphering out DNA and how it can be

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:29,929
unique to particular individuals and

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:32,789
what that can tell us all right so our

11
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:35,100
fingerprinting each person's DNA pattern

12
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,058
different it's a good question to ask we

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,160
have actually sections of what's

14
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,558
commonly referred to as junk DNA

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,599
it doesn't really encode for proteins

16
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,000
suite of repeated patterns each person

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,550
may have different number of repeats and

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,679
many sites in our 23 chromosomes have

19
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,569
different repeated patterns these

20
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,140
different patterns to set the patterns

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,179
on our fingers give us the what we call

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,270
the DNA fingerprint identify us as

23
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,299
unique this is just an example here of

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,769
looking at all the different G's and C's

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,679
College the different patterns that do

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,020
occur on how different individuals if

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,820
these two individuals have different

28
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:14,188
repeated patterns here I held those in

29
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,039
green see it hopefully stand out a

30
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,109
little bit better so do you need

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,780
patterns for a DNA fingerprint so we

32
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,759
have allele 1 and I've indicated a

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,280
couple things here are cut sites

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,950
remember our restriction enzymes are

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,759
cutting at very specific sites in these

36
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,129
in red and red are the same cut sites

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,969
the same restriction enzyme will cut at

38
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:41,009
both of those sites so we cut the DNA

39
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:44,250
you notice here try to separate it out

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,750
cut the DNA there a little bit here's

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,149
our section 1 our section 2 in our

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,859
section 3 how this would look and we run

43
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,840
a gel section 1 section 2 and section 3

44
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,739
but the yellow one here and our two

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,240
other darker regions here for allele 1

46
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:03,750
now differs between two people now we

47
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,429
have person 2 with more repeats I have

48
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,590
we go through we cut that section out

49
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,739
there's our section 1 or section 2 in

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,620
our section 3 and as we can see here

51
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,650
we're getting a different run of

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,959
these to cut sites one and three are the

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,180
same size but this section too is

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,420
different there's more junk DNA

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:30,150
essentially here causing it to be a

56
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:31,889
different run on the gel so our DNA

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,650
fingerprints are comparing our blood

58
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:37,139
samples of Defense clothing on that of

59
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,019
the victim you can see here's mom here's

60
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:43,500
dad and then we're looking at other

61
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:46,200
potential matches here on the offspring

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,709
and there are going to be differences in

63
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:52,560
offspring comparing because they're

64
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,689
through the comedy and a through

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,098
crossing over through independent

66
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,609
assortment and all that you're going to

67
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:02,518
get slightly different DNA sequences but

68
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:06,150
you're still gonna notice odds are some

69
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,489
similarities and the example here the

70
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,908
defendants blood the victim's blood and

71
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,459
then potential blood from defendants

72
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:17,548
clothes we're able again to develop this

73
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,650
fingerprint to get sort of a comparison

74
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,569
here we could see where victim's blood

75
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,849
may have gotten cross contaminated here

76
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:27,899
this is some of the power of genetics

77
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:29,969
that's used so this process is what used

78
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,430
to determine if two samples are from the

79
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:35,400
same source looking at DNA of two

80
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,939
sources of fragments with restriction

81
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,889
enzymes

82
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,469
remember those restriction enzymes cut

83
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,939
very specific regions fragments are

84
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,159
separated using the gel electrophoresis

85
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,229
and transferred to the filler and then

86
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,469
here we're able to probe and compare

87
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:51,209
them also used for evolutionary

88
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:53,639
relationships compare DNA samples from

89
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,150
different organisms to measure how

90
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,150
closely they may be related genetically

91
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,039
so we have our DNA fair sample to sample

92
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,650
three sample four and sample five

93
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,019
remember the larger segments are up here

94
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,750
the smaller ones are down here and this

95
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,579
allows us to see how a turtle a snake a

96
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,219
rat squirrel and a fruit fly all may

97
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,608
interrelate and what commonalities they

98
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:21,149
may have what may be similar on what

99
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,668
might be more distantly related so

100
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,709
medical diagnosis comparing normal

101
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:27,629
alleles to a disease allele here's a

102
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,729
chromosome with normal allele a disease

103
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,319
causing allele here we run those alleles

104
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,540
on the gel and we see they didn't do cut

105
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,089
of different regions the example would

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,379
be one of Huntington's disease we're

107
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:39,359
looking to identify those different

108
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,009
alleles again you say well they're the

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,500
same length right how can there be

110
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,779
different sizes to DNA fragments if

111
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,879
they're the same length while they are

112
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,919
in total the same length there's

113
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,110
different sequences in those restriction

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,840
enzymes are going to cut this different

115
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,699
portions giving it to different

116
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:01,049
fragments than this allele here

117
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,060
forensic siz where we commonly associate

118
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,829
things with comparing samples from a

119
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,139
crime scene if this has beckoned in a

120
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:09,680
victim here's our suspect here's our

121
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,689
crime scene sample I should say

122
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,280
volunteer here or our victim you know

123
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:18,120
and we're looking at three different

124
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,009
suspects so the victim typically will

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,889
volunteer with your sample we have the

126
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,629
crime scene sample and now we need to

127
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,829
determine potentially which one of these

128
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,769
three subjects if there's any

129
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:31,039
correlation or matching that occurs

130
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:33,389
suspect one suspect to suspect three

131
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,129
comparing to the crime scene sample so

132
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,479
we're looking for commonalities so

133
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,370
initially we look at this one we say

134
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,040
well suspect two and three both share

135
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,199
this however we need to compare all of

136
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,870
the bands to ver the true fingerprint

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,120
and we see as we get down here suspect

138
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,800
two matches not only this band but also

139
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,160
this band this band in this band became

140
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,650
suspect two is a very close match for

141
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,280
the sample at the crime scene that is

142
00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:04,319
different than the victim and suspect

143
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:06,229
two is the most likely match here so

144
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,810
RFLP restriction fragment length

145
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:12,420
polymorphism and electrophoresis is used

146
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,579
in forensic science so we could be

147
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,379
getting a semen sample from a rapist and

148
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,409
a blood sample from the suspect running

149
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,750
against the standard and allowing us to

150
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,990
develop a sense of comparison of what

151
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,149
may match up because DNA fingerprinting

152
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,540
ZAR unique this can allow us to

153
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:33,539
eliminate other potential suspects and

154
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,580
get close to identifying an individual

155
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:41,040
or determine whether an individual of

156
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:43,740
interest has left DNA behind and

157
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,340
a potential to be there on the scene and

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,470
contribute something in some way so the

159
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,879
RFLP again these are just markers that

160
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,900
are used and we're looking at different

161
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,659
cut sites

162
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,219
remember those restriction enzymes are

163
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,220
going to read right along and cut very

164
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,900
specific regions as we see here there

165
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,000
are more cut sites indicating smaller

166
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,039
fragments here there's only one cut say

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,189
a very large fragment not running very

168
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,650
far in the gel so we can best do a

169
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,269
real-world example here and it's a

170
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,149
little Myrtle trial do you think the

171
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:16,409
suspect is guilty so here's our standard

172
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:18,509
manage what we're comparing so blood

173
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,240
sample 1 from the crime scene blood

174
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:23,430
sample 2 blood sample 3 and try to

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,040
indicate here okay I did get this

176
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,560
PowerPoint online look in the

177
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,810
description for the links ie where I say

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,660
the sources here I headed some pictures

179
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,660
which are also indicated as far as where

180
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,610
I got those so we're looking at it's a

181
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,590
little faint might be a little hard to

182
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,180
initially see but if we look at these

183
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:43,919
regions right here we clearly see

184
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,829
there's some bands occurring gender

185
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,689
marks there's some arrows there a blood

186
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:51,359
sample - from the crime scene and this

187
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:54,509
is a greater collection here and blood

188
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,000
sample 3 it's kind of those three

189
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:59,759
matching this match ding and mismatching

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,490
when we complain about sample 1 &amp; 3 we

191
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,000
see a lot of commonalities but sample 2

192
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,970
not as many so i'll blood sample from

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,579
the victim a little hard to see again

194
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:15,990
this image but very closely matching the

195
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:18,810
blood sample number 2 listed above bliss

196
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,540
you know from the victim here wow I know

197
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,970
it's a little bit of a different pattern

198
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,189
and blood sample from the suspect we

199
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,720
could see again the circles and the

200
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:31,829
colors hopefully try to match it up a

201
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,490
little bit closer and the blood sample

202
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:38,728
here was from OJ Simpson the victim here

203
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,279
was Nicole Brown and then Ron Goldman's

204
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:44,040
myself up here a little bit and we could

205
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,079
see where our suspects and victims in

206
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,509
crime scene how we're starting now to

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,180
develop a pattern of what we're kind of

208
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:53,639
seeing what matches up with a lot this

209
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,719
is some of the power that a DNA kind of

210
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,509
conserve

211
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,430
to try to help us correlate if someone

212
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:01,438
was potentially there because of the

213
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:05,878
unique fingerprints that individuals

214
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:10,139
have in their DNA and then on the Cobra

215
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:12,149
here so how Joe looks in real life again

216
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,459
that as you saw in that example they may

217
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,740
not always be perfectly clear there's

218
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:19,500
typically a DNA ladder loaded and that

219
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,110
tells us the what the size the bands are

220
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,688
that allows us to compare these thicker

221
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,669
bands here indicating there's more DNA

222
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:28,799
of that particular size present in the

223
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:32,338
sample you can see here they're not

224
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,179
always super easy to read so for

225
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,879
paternity test

226
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,219
here's mom's DNA here's the child's DNA

227
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,959
and we have two potential father mom

228
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,019
figures we'll hit determine which father

229
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,299
if any of these match up so his father

230
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,120
one there's fabric two compared to the

231
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:50,609
child - the child shares these bands in

232
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,519
these commonalities getting father to in

233
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,769
this case is the most likely father of

234
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,759
the child here whose DNA's been

235
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:02,308
sequenced so hopefully this was helpful

236
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,339
there's some other great videos on

237
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:07,740
YouTube you can also go through and if

238
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,290
you click on these links again the links

239
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,509
to these are provided in the description

240
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:15,058
go to the slideshow you can actually try

241
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:17,909
the process of PCR yourself virtually

242
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:19,558
and also electrophoresis my videos

243
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,719
posted on both of these that you're

244
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:23,818
welcome to look at hopefully supply you

245
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,660
some good information to develop a good

246
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:26,659
understanding
