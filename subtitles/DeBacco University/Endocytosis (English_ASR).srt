1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:06,509
okay looking here at endocytosis I'm

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,480
gonna be looking at taking some things

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,759
into the cell and how it goes about

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,490
doing that now the process may differ

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,399
depending on what particles the cell

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,759
might be taking in so under endocytosis

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,159
it's basically the plasma membrane

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,490
envelopes small particles or fluid then

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,698
seals itself in the form of a vesicle or

10
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,739
vacuole which enters the cell super here

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,050
there's three different types

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:37,969
phagocytosis pinocytosis and receptor

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:40,949
mediated endocytosis quick image of each

14
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:44,399
phagocytosis here Penasquitos is here

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,780
receptor mediated endocytosis let's talk

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,840
about each a little bit more detail so

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm a phagocytosis kind of look this

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,039
little image shows here they sell

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,739
engulfs a particle by wrapping around it

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,260
Paddington's and membrane and

21
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,479
classifying it as a vacuole the particle

22
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:04,469
is digested after the vacuole fuses with

23
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,459
a licen containing hydrolytic enzymes so

24
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:07,890
basically were taking something in

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,750
sealing it off and in this case

26
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,329
destroying it we're adding enzymes to

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,810
help break it down this is be an example

28
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:19,560
of phagocytosis here's another example

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,600
of the process we have this bacterium

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,280
being taking in here's our vacuole

31
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,578
essentially here we have our little

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,840
vesicle being formed our lice own is

33
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:33,239
binding these little green things

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,719
represent little enzymes we see that's

35
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,879
being added here to the phago license

36
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,728
and then we're breaking that cell apart

37
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,170
and we're getting rid of the debris this

38
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,118
might be something about think about for

39
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,070
like white blood cells taking in foreign

40
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,780
bacteria and helping destroy it

41
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:52,379
this is kind of the process that they go

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,379
through pinocytosis may look initially

43
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,599
the same where we're having the membrane

44
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:00,390
pinch in forming these vesicles

45
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,819
however with pinocytosis think the cell

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,489
gulping droplets of extracellular fluid

47
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:08,429
into the vesicles this is more water and

48
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:10,049
ion containing water on step it's not

49
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,878
the fluid itself that is needed by the

50
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,920
cell but the molecules dissolved in the

51
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,829
droplet so all this taking in

52
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,439
water it's really not the water per se

53
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,599
the cell needs its what's dissolved in

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,370
the water of the cell needs because any

55
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,439
and all included solutes are taken into

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,840
the cell but no so does this remember is

57
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,879
nonspecific and the substances it

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,739
transports it's here just kind of

59
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,139
grabbed here instead of grabbing a star

60
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,270
item it grabbed a little blue box the

61
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,979
blue box was forming the vesicle and it

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,330
just kind of pinched itself to me took

63
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,318
what was me right that's example

64
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,700
pinocytosis in contrast to that very

65
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,699
specific is receptor mediated

66
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,349
endocytosis this enables the cell

67
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,539
declare bulk lines of specific

68
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,159
substances even though those substances

69
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,650
may not be very concentrating

70
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,259
extracellular fluid so if there's only a

71
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,750
couple molecules floating around the

72
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,818
cell receptor mediated will allow those

73
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,709
molecules to enter the cell because as

74
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,169
soon as it bumps into one of these

75
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,120
receptors it binds to it and that's

76
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:12,689
gonna initiate cellular processes to

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,920
help take that in to the cell embedded

78
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,840
in the membrane our proteins with

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,208
specific receptor sites exposed to the

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
extracellular surface here's our plasma

81
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,709
membrane here's our little blue protein

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,109
its binding specifically to this red

83
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,609
triangle the receptor proteins are

84
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,100
usually already clustered in regions in

85
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,920
the membrane called coated pits which

86
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,509
are aligned with their cytoplasm

87
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,000
cytoplasmic side by a fuzzy later of

88
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,949
coat proteins all this means is that

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,310
here's our protein exposed to the

90
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:44,099
extracellular fluid the outside this red

91
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,159
triangle is binding to this blue protein

92
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,500
here it's very specific anything else is

93
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,079
that combined binds and allows it to be

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,079
taken into the cell receptor media it

95
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,299
meets a very specific site a reception

96
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,709
in order for this to be taken into the

97
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,030
cell through the process of endocytosis

98
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,870
exocytosis is the exact opposite of

99
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,289
endocytosis

100
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,450
if endo is taking in EXO is leading

101
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,739
during this process the moment of the

102
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,509
vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane

103
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,759
its contents are released to the outer

104
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:16,738
portions of the cell here's our vesicle

105
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,689
it's a binding now to the plasma

106
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,388
membrane and instead of sealing it up

107
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,310
it's now simply open it up spilling the

108
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:27,460
contents out to the extracellular fluid

109
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,259
this is example of exocytosis this is

110
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,269
good video to watch that helps explain

111
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,120
and goes over this process a little bit

112
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:36,819
more remember endocytosis has three

113
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,680
forms phagocytosis is taking in

114
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,990
typically food items or in white blood

115
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,650
cells case foreign bacteria pinocytosis

116
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,960
is grabbing in fluid with ions as really

117
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,989
the cells looking for the ions receptor

118
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,180
mediated in specific binding sites and

119
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,310
exocytosis is just the opposite this

120
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,800
process things are budding off from our

121
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:00,490
golgi apparatus but enough and leaving

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,978
the cell they could be hormones they

123
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,300
could be signals or it could be waste

124
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:06,909
products either way

125
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,840
exocytosis is exiting and no it's being

126
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,840
taken into this
