1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
okay for those playing the home game

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,910
here's the question is it easier to hold

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,230
your breath after inhalation or is it

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,798
easier to hold your breath after

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,480
exhalation

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:18,868
see and you can try it out for yourself

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,300
and see which method allows you to hold

8
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:22,649
your breath for longer I think just you

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,010
pause the video here I don't want to see

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,509
you pass out okay moving on so let's go

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,830
with the science on this so why is it

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,470
easier to hold your breath hopefully

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,549
they found after inhalation you should

14
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,759
be able hold your breath longer than

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:39,269
after you exhale so your body actually

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,968
cannot detect low oxygen but it is very

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,829
sensitive to high carbon dioxide your

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,350
brain actually uses blood carbon dioxide

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,570
as an indicator for blood oxygen this

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,910
soon so when co2 levels are too high

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,829
we are signaled to take a breath it's

22
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,919
assuming when co2 levels are high that

23
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,329
oxygen levels are low this is kind of

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,448
the exchange that's going on in the

25
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,739
capillaries of your lungs

26
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:03,269
so let's proof-of-concept oil if you

27
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,849
think that well I think my body can

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,540
sense the oxygen levels that nothing to

29
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:11,669
come that side consider carbon monoxide

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,950
poisoning it happens because you're

31
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,719
breathing air with low oxygen but

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,659
believe it or not that carbon dioxide

33
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:22,618
co2 levels from evarin monoxide is just

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,479
Co co2 levels are the same in your body

35
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,118
in which regulates your breathing as

36
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,060
usual so you die without ever realizing

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,489
you were oxygen deprived this is what

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,799
happens when carbon monoxide poisoning

39
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,658
is so dangerous this real blackout

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,979
without any warning you're just

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,390
breathing along normally because your

42
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,009
body actually is the same amount of

43
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,320
carbon dioxide which is using the sense

44
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,090
but your oxygen levels are actually

45
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,209
decreasing in a very rapid and

46
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,320
potentially very dangerous rate with

47
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,688
carbon monoxide so the science behind

48
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,609
the question so when your lungs are full

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,728
of breath of air you have a high oxygen

50
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:02,549
concentration and a lower carbon dioxide

51
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:07,379
concentration then your blood does so

52
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,060
when your inhale the oxygen flows to

53
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,530
your blood and co2 out of the blood

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,189
there's still exchange it occurs because

55
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,030
you have a large volume of air

56
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:19,669
empty lungs have to exhale have a lower

57
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,439
volume so fewer carbon dioxide molecules

58
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:23,149
are needed to get the same concentration

59
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,729
in your blood that's going to raise that

60
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,319
level that much quicker because of this

61
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,269
carbon exit stops leaving your blood

62
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,639
faster the lungs are empty

63
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:36,170
meaning the co2 levels in your blood

64
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:38,029
reach a critical level faster and causes

65
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:41,329
you to need or feel that burden of

66
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,129
needing to breathe sooner then when you

67
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,090
inhale they're still exchanging that's

68
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:50,030
occurring here and it's through the

69
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,580
body's ability to monitor the carbon

70
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,129
dioxide levels and has nothing to do

71
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,650
with oxygen levels so we see that here

72
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:00,019
that kind of urgent need to breathe here

73
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,730
high carbon dioxide levels that burning

74
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,370
feeling as your body wants to try to

75
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:06,619
reduce that carbon dioxide it's assuming

76
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,930
this increase in carbon dioxide is

77
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,000
leading to a decrease in oxygen it can

78
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,830
only sense and determine the carbon

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,419
dioxide levels because it's going to

80
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,070
change the leave amount of the pH of

81
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:18,769
your blood and that's what your body is

82
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,930
sensing so this gives just a little bit

83
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,060
of background here of is it easier to

84
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,319
hold your breath after breathing in and

85
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,400
breathing out and if you are in a

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,259
situation do you have to hold your

87
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,840
breath take the deepest breath you can

88
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:32,299
possible so fill your lungs with a lot

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,550
of air to allow that exchange to occur

90
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,620
for a longer period of time giving you

91
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,810
that ability to not feel that urgent

92
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,730
need to breathe until later then if you

93
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,989
were to exhale that concentration would

94
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,988
increase much quicker
