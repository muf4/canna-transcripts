1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,528
here we're looking at plant production

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:07,048
and what it takes to initially get

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,150
plants started so that ideally they can

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,980
grow well during the season and you can

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,480
get a bountiful harvest off that only

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,400
see a nice collection of fruits and

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,960
vegetables here from the speaking

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,600
generalities but a lot of these things

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,789
can apply and and take them as reference

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,920
points for whatever specific crop you're

11
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,600
looking at growing

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,189
so starting with the main summary our

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,109
goal is to turn this into this it's some

14
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,840
way to take our fruits of our labor

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,969
literally speaking and generate a some

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,829
sort of profit to not support the farm

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,739
but our activities maybe offseason and

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,980
to allow us to have financial income to

19
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:46,078
grow the following year so it all starts

20
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,898
with the seed not always because there's

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,878
grafted plants so you decide what you

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,009
plant now certain market demands may

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,229
require you to grow certain types of

24
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,308
crops but specific varieties is where

25
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,869
you come in and you can make that

26
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,308
decision

27
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:00,780
grab the plants are worth considering we

28
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,729
see some examples of some grafted

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,700
Tomatoes here through disease resistant

30
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,920
root stock meaning the bottom portion

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,859
here the roots in the soil can be

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,978
resistant to certain soil borne diseases

33
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,819
and there's a better tasting portion on

34
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:20,340
top there's oftentimes the top portion

35
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:21,829
that's maybe better tasting may not have

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,850
the disease resistance that we want

37
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:26,429
versus the plants that are disease

38
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,530
resistant may not have the taste we want

39
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,220
so grafting we kind of get the best of

40
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,439
both worlds

41
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,390
literally the downfall of grafted plants

42
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,179
as they do cost more but in the end it

43
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,368
might be worth that cost remember if you

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,350
do grow grafted plants to leave this

45
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,599
graft union above the soil line

46
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,640
particularly with tomatoes if you bury

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,908
this graft union below the soil line

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,489
roots will form from the top section and

49
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,450
you'll lose the ability of the advantage

50
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:56,728
I should say of having that graft union

51
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,320
so what's just left there's so many seed

52
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,209
catalogs so many seeds we didn't

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,609
varieties how do you kind of go about

54
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,188
developing its selection for what you're

55
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:07,259
actually going to plant so what to look

56
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,758
for is do some things the descriptions

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,439
will always provide you the best quality

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,809
so keep that in mind you're reading the

59
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,650
seed catalog every seed sounds like do

60
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,989
no wrong because you're

61
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,980
supplied with the best qualities

62
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,628
behavior is important to make sure it'll

63
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,938
fit your growing situation for planning

64
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:22,620
purposes you wanna be careful on some

65
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:25,019
varieties whether it's a bush or a vine

66
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,879
that can impact your row spacing that

67
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,099
same one's better than the other but

68
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,318
just be aware if you're buying a bush

69
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:34,280
riding it to be more compact in the vine

70
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,289
variety tends to spread out war

71
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,209
vegetable seed selection tips we want to

72
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:41,039
be looking for certain things disease

73
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,688
resistance that we can get it your

74
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,060
market interest because if you grow it

75
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:47,489
you can't sell it there's no point

76
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,158
flavor it's gonna be subjective and then

77
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,590
a plant behavior is it a tall plant a

78
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,449
vining plant at spreading plant and we

79
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,680
type the picture of the horses here we

80
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,818
want to take kind of all the horses and

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,069
select what we think is gonna be the

82
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,899
winner for our situation may not always

83
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:03,449
be the winner all the time in every

84
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,709
growers situation but for your specific

85
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,259
conditions you want to pick what you

86
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,158
think is going to best fit in with all

87
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,719
of your other constraints you may have

88
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,060
disease resistance is a big one that's a

89
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,620
very important feature to look for this

90
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,079
potentially saved the crop with no

91
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,750
needed inputs from you there's a typical

92
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:25,230
key and each manufacturer may have a

93
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,299
slightly different key but this is some

94
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,548
very common ones beryllium well Fusarium

95
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,769
brunet nematodes tobacco mosaic virus

96
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:33,810
this is example one form one out to

97
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,658
visit was Tomatoes we could see the

98
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,090
tomatoes here the plants at least look

99
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:41,399
pretty well shot the plants here

100
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,489
immediately where the steak is from this

101
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,500
row down look very healthy this was a

102
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,319
tomato variety there's a mountain

103
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,090
mountain merit when it first came out

104
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,208
and late blight came in you could see

105
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,769
how devastating this was here's a grower

106
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,329
that didn't have to spray anything by

107
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,269
choosing just a certain variety that was

108
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,099
resistant to the disease they're able to

109
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,310
get a much healthier plant versus the

110
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:07,228
ones that will not resist it so I

111
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,569
mentioned the terms resistance Missi

112
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:11,430
resistance some manufacturers nickel

113
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:13,768
tolerant these are not interchangeable

114
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,810
terms how it means that the plant may

115
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,569
get the disease but typically will

116
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,158
survive resistant translates to in most

117
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,189
cases it will not contract the disease

118
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:24,899
at all so if you have the option of a

119
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,149
tolerant plant or visa student plant

120
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:30,029
choose a resistant plant

121
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:34,198
it's more likely to survive than a

122
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,879
tolerant plant open up a seed catalog

123
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,410
against residents don't try them all

124
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,709
there's 8 million different varieties it

125
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:44,850
seems like and you're trying to select 1

126
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:46,500
2 3 4 not a thousand not a hundred not

127
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,990
grow a whole bunch and see what makes it

128
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,759
try to be selective on the varieties

129
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,918
that you do give a try realize that each

130
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,259
year's different so before you commit to

131
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,329
just one variety try it for multiple

132
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,300
years and develop an idea of your

133
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:02,668
standard variety for comparison so is it

134
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,288
that better than what you last year do

135
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:06,418
you have a variety to really like that

136
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:08,430
can offer your comparison for me I use

137
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,469
for example better boy Tomatoes that's

138
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,209
kind of my comparison how does it

139
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,919
compare to the better boy is it taller

140
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:16,109
is it more disease-resistant

141
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,819
I do produce quicker yields more uniform

142
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,270
yields so on and so forth that's my

143
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,370
example of my tomato variety comparison

144
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,589
I want to try something new I always

145
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,220
point it next to a better boy variety

146
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:31,079
and see outperforms didn't conduct of

147
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,889
seeds versus transplants so again pros

148
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,870
and cons to everything

149
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,970
seeding very easy can avoid root

150
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,348
disturbance the cons is the fear of the

151
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,610
unknown if you put a bunch of seeds in

152
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,899
the ground and crows come through behind

153
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,930
you and pick the seeds out of the field

154
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,948
yes that's happened to me you're looking

155
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,530
a week later and you're wondering why

156
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,250
there's nothing germinating

157
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:49,978
transplanting the advantages you have an

158
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,709
instant field right Thrun what was empty

159
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:54,689
in the morning can be fully complete

160
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:56,129
with plants for the afternoon avoids

161
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,649
potential animal damage because you've

162
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:00,538
got the see the transplants not the

163
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,250
seeds growing right in the ground the

164
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:03,478
con to this so there's more time caring

165
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,060
for the seedlings that are hurting off

166
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,348
process if you're seeding you don't have

167
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,848
to go through gets a big cedar here this

168
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:10,800
is an example of a large scale corn

169
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:11,449
cedar you can hand see the field at no

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,189
problem

171
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,810
if you are gonna do transplants one of

172
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,819
an adequate germination environment I

173
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,430
wanna make sure it's warm well-lit good

174
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,689
air circulation and easy access if

175
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,038
you've done in the basement that's not a

176
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:26,490
problem there's a bunch of tomato plants

177
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,139
being grown for a winter warm has a

178
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,840
relative term don't have to be super hot

179
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,430
just warm well let you see a bunch of

180
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,869
different lights here good air

181
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,689
circulation is important no one in a

182
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,780
closed environment and easy access in

183
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,430
and out for you

184
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,859
with good seed starting mix seed

185
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,310
starting mix potting soil should be

186
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,810
selected seed starting mix has finer

187
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,000
versus a regular just potting soil it's

188
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,459
better for seed to soil contact to get

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,079
the moisture content there so you want

190
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,329
seed starting mix not necessary potting

191
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,409
soil it's a little finer and it was

192
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:02,759
especially good for those smaller seeds

193
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,470
trays are often used want to select the

194
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,870
appropriate size to maximize the area

195
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,900
but not restrict the seedling growth too

196
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,540
much be sure to label them all so you

197
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,039
don't get confused or move one for some

198
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,530
reason then realize oh I don't remember

199
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,450
what variety that was we see here also

200
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:21,479
labels in different pots here every tray

201
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,800
is labeled that's an important then time

202
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,569
is money standardize your trays and

203
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,069
added Dib ler to help speed up the

204
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,349
production yes there's a little hand

205
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,839
iblis you can use but this is just some

206
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,210
dowels on a piece of wood you flip this

207
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,310
over merely puts a hold the right depth

208
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:37,439
all the trace at the same time you drop

209
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,959
all your little seeds in and you go on

210
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,329
to the next tray again that speed

211
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,250
efficiency standardizing your trays that

212
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:47,310
planning process is important it helps

213
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,720
you in the long run germination once the

214
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,879
seed emerges it will need the light

215
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,919
so brilliance have the proper spectrum

216
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,300
compared to regular house lights there's

217
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,549
many options when you're looking at

218
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,978
lighting this is what the plants absorb

219
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,629
you can see not a lot of green it the

220
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,990
chlorophyll is strong in the kind of the

221
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,790
bluish spectrum spectrum and also the

222
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,160
red spectrum different Calvin

223
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,120
temperature charts you need different

224
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,120
types of lights will produce different

225
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,110
color temperatures there's Minneapolis

226
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,689
I'm gonna go through a few of them and

227
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,410
compare so I'm just you have an idea but

228
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:21,180
LED metal halides high pressure sodium

229
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,850
fluorescent in natural light or the

230
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,990
common options comparing LEDs which

231
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,580
effect these purple kinda lights

232
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,780
compared to metal halides or

233
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,490
high-pressure sodium

234
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,228
this happens to be high pressure sodium

235
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,889
produces kind of that more orange color

236
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:36,809
middle house rousseau whiter light

237
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,759
advantage to the LEDs though low power

238
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,799
consumption efficient spectrum you can

239
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,779
actually dial in spectrums here the cons

240
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,479
are they are quite expensive they don't

241
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,059
cover a whole lot of area metal halide

242
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,940
inhale and HPS high pressure sodium czar

243
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:53,278
easy to find to booking one bubble cover

244
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,350
5x5 area the cons are

245
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,610
power consumption now they do consume

246
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,409
quite a bit of power and eight generate

247
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,169
a lot of heat so those should be taken

248
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:03,448
into consideration fluorescents versus

249
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:05,429
natural fluorescence relatively low

250
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:07,349
power consumption can fit easily over si

251
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,609
trays but they need to be kept really

252
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,399
close to the ceiling so you want to put

253
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,039
them on a hanging chain so you can raise

254
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,778
them as the plants grow upwards and not

255
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,969
good for long-term growth they don't

256
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:19,799
really produce a lot of light Naturals

257
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,139
free can be just hard enough time it's

258
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,370
great but when you're starting your

259
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,259
seeds and germinating them it could be

260
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,509
short day lengths and that could cause

261
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,879
issues and also I'll cause temperature

262
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,379
spikes really get hot during the day and

263
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,550
cool off at night so again just

264
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:34,558
something to consider

265
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,990
most of girls I see do use the

266
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:40,289
fluorescence so just use it as a

267
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,818
comparison hardly not that I mentioned

268
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,278
especially using fluorescence or kind of

269
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:45,539
a weak intensity and light you want to

270
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,759
make sure the plants are coming from

271
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,219
protected to a consistent environment

272
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,550
that they're ready for the extremes of

273
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,800
outside light temperature of the outside

274
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:57,750
world wind in seem like a desert even

275
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,099
they might be wandering them they keep

276
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,480
them inside that's where the air

277
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,790
circulation is important keeping the

278
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,620
bees on them hurting them off getting

279
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,338
exposed to natural sunlight before just

280
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,659
putting them outside from the basement

281
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,889
transplanting an early protection you

282
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:13,438
want to consider temperature swings

283
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:15,299
water stress humidity temperature

284
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:17,370
related animals who disclose and mice

285
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,269
attacking the plants you could go

286
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,919
through if you're a really

287
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,009
labor-intensive make little Hut's to put

288
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,948
over the nutrients plants here we see a

289
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:27,688
grower here as we block down walking

290
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:29,778
board so don't come back the soil and

291
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:32,730
they set up these little plastic kind of

292
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:35,039
walls this prevents wind damage

293
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,360
especially in these large leaves when

294
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,159
the image from curtain Corrine and

295
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,110
knocking the plant over causing damage

296
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,500
the top is left open so there's not a

297
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,110
temperature consideration or reason for

298
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,990
concern but the sides are protected in

299
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,769
help harden them off in the way of winds

300
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,610
damaged plant requirements how towels

301
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:55,289
are gonna get them and then the

302
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,269
varieties that you select so consider

303
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,740
this when your seed selecting do you

304
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,139
need hoops for early season protection

305
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,730
and they can support shade cloth as a

306
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:04,318
way to harden off some plants it may

307
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,449
take a little bit longer and they can

308
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:07,079
also hold insect netting so you might

309
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,609
may want to

310
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,590
go outside and mainly cover with in

311
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,960
forensic netting especially important

312
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,810
for cucumber beetles for our squash

313
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,519
plants especially have later plantings

314
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:19,619
squash bugs even protecting from a fits

315
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
if you have small enough mesh size so

316
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,179
just again things to consider when

317
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,039
you're going to be transplanting outside

318
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:28,049
in season care shell Sandra weaving you

319
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,419
could see these stakes here

320
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:32,189
do you have materials is a good question

321
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,229
well the tomatoes need staking let me go

322
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,610
buy some stakes well odds are a lot of

323
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,659
other people have that same idea and you

324
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,730
may not be able to get the stakes you

325
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,990
need weeding what method are you gonna

326
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,550
select for me to have another video on

327
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,370
weeding there you can use just regular

328
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:47,609
organic kind of hay mulch here or you

329
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,629
can use plastic pruning for tomatoes and

330
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,360
particularly how you gonna do it a

331
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:55,139
single loser double leader no pruning

332
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,970
heavy pruning it all depends harvesting

333
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,129
how often in at what stage you can

334
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,389
harvest you can pick tomatoes at what's

335
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,159
called the breaker stage with little

336
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:04,799
pink on the bottom or waiting them to

337
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,769
get fully red again all decisions need

338
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,269
to Nathan develop a plan for net harvest

339
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,939
we want to consider when you're

340
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,529
harvesting field heat utilities want to

341
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,500
harvest in the early morning or late

342
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:18,629
evening midday can cause them to dry out

343
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,639
pretty quick they contain a lot of heat

344
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:23,490
from the Sun particularly in the summer

345
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,110
and it's introduced storage time how

346
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,399
often do you want to be harvesting at

347
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,019
what stage do you want to harvest

348
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,179
they've been on your market or if you're

349
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,039
doing a farmers market wholesale on the

350
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:34,769
CSA community-supported agriculture or

351
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,689
something else restaurants all can

352
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,389
influence this but again things you want

353
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,470
to have in your plan for consideration

354
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:42,600
example summer squash repair of

355
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,740
continual harvests now people can do

356
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,420
those almost every day

357
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,310
tomatoes can be harvested before fully

358
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,809
ripe it will call the breaker stage is

359
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,969
they starting a little pink at the

360
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:53,369
bottom here if you're doing berry crops

361
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,750
and they can be very labor-intensive you

362
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,000
want to pick them out when they're

363
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,639
basically fully ripe that have an idea

364
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,889
what's ripening so you can have an idea

365
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,960
what you have for a harvest in post

366
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,870
harvest storage of the crops we grate

367
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,070
your harvest it where is it going to go

368
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,649
and after you're done with the crop

369
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,660
field cleanup this could often be left

370
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,879
to the very end of the season but

371
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,959
certain crops if they're if you're done

372
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,639
with them you want to find a way to

373
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,330
basically remove them or kill them off

374
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,370
they can hurled Harbor disease or other

375
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,740
cool BOTS or some type of refrigeration

376
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,990
system is a great thing to be putting

377
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,639
into your plan and considering so you

378
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,070
can cool and remove that field heat

379
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,259
large stackable storage bins and have

380
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,720
good air circulation also important in

381
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,860
worth consideration so again this comes

382
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,920
back to that planning that time

383
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,539
investment and having an idea of what's

384
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,539
going to occur over the entire season
