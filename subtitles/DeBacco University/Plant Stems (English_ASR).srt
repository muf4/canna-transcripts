1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
okay here we look at plant stems in a

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,609
little bit more detail I thought this

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,039
was kind of an interesting image to show

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,879
here some of the tree trunks from

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,039
different angle

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,780
showing the stems and where I'll learn a

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,399
little bit more about them more than

8
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,219
just trees but how there's different

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,670
types of stems to depend on different

10
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,288
types of classifications of plants so

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,269
starting with the stems in general they

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,220
often experience both primary and

13
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,469
secondary growth remember primary is

14
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,299
growing upwards and downwards secondary

15
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,030
growth is the growth in the diameter of

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,500
a plant stems are the source of the

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,689
economically important product called

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,140
wood and the primary growth of a chute

19
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,369
leaves first appearance primordia so I'm

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,950
not going to quiz you on all the

21
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,808
individual little tiny terms here I

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,210
figure it's worth putting on a good

23
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:51,179
picture kind of to describe some of

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,859
those and the leaf primordium here gee

25
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,359
that's kind of off to the side here and

26
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,399
that's where the leaves are initiating

27
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,070
this is our highest rate of cell

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,739
division here at E and that's the apical

29
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,489
meristems you should be familiar with B

30
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:08,099
is the ground meristem here and C is the

31
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,859
leaf gap of it in here so it is familiar

32
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,798
to familiarize yourself with this

33
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:15,420
microscopic look at a stem a little bit

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,799
more of a macroscopic view that you

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,890
might be a little bit more familiar with

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
this stem anatomy nodes this is the area

37
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,030
where our leaves are originating

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,629
internodes is it simply the distance

39
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,030
between two nodes the blade or the leaf

40
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,798
and the petiole which is the supporting

41
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,019
structure that supports the leaf or the

42
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,210
blade so just be familiar with the stem

43
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,530
anatomy to be able to recognize that we

44
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,809
will be doing some activities where you

45
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,579
have to identify certain stems and

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,960
leaves in this video might prove helpful

47
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:48,359
in the future so hypo and epi coddles

48
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,209
all the epicotyl in the hypo caudal all

49
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,670
are in relation to the cotyledon leaves

50
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,368
so you can see this is clearly a dicot

51
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,579
because there's two seed leaves and the

52
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:01,950
stem region below those two seed leaves

53
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,679
is called the hypo caudal hypo meaning

54
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,530
below or under so hypo Connell is

55
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,229
underneath those two cotyledons and the

56
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,140
epicotyl is above those two cotyledons

57
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,560
or seat leaves in this case so if I ask

58
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,829
you

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,840
the epicotyl or something with the hypo

60
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,010
cattle these would be the region's you'd

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,680
be looking in addition to tissue

62
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:28,500
patterns and stems we have monocotyledon

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,629
stems so these are monocots as remember

64
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,489
from our grass blades or our coordinate

65
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,650
the cross-section contains a more

66
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,180
scattered approach that in dicots we

67
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,370
found some excellent on lines and

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,840
excellent microscopic images showing an

69
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,310
appreciation for what these stems

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,469
actually look like in these different

71
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,810
types of plants so we're talking

72
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,239
monocots we're talking stems they

73
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,370
produce no secondary vascular tissues or

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,689
cork when I say more scattered our

75
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,519
vascular planners are more scattered

76
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:54,780
even though you may initially say that

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
yes there's a little bit more towards

78
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,110
the perimeter which is true but they are

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,340
definitely more scattered when you

80
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,170
compare to the dicots

81
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,799
so this is what the stem would look like

82
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:07,949
in a monocot looking at herbaceous

83
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,069
dicotyledons stem remember her basis are

84
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:13,859
not going to produce any form of wood

85
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:16,649
structure so herbaceous dicotyledons

86
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,959
stems they have discrete vascular

87
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,799
bundles and they're located mainly on

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,659
the perimeter

89
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,760
so you'll notice the pith in the middle

90
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,340
here and all the vascular bundles are

91
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,709
located on the perimeter to go back from

92
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,090
one moment at the monocots here notice

93
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,409
that yes there's a more concentration

94
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,079
towards the perimeter but they are

95
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,959
scattered and the interior as well

96
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,989
within the pith as you see here with the

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,060
herbaceous die-cuts they are only in the

98
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:45,329
perimeter of the cell understand in

99
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,069
these cases the cortex the epidermis

100
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,409
from it's the outer portion and our

101
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:52,888
vascular bundle now if we zoom in our

102
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:55,650
vascular bundle we notice here that we

103
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,510
have on the top we have our phloem and

104
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,450
then as we work our way down we have our

105
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:02,789
xylem there in the middles our vascular

106
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:05,189
cambium here producing phloem to the

107
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,388
outside in xylem to the inside again

108
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:10,590
it's a pretty good images that I found

109
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,329
online links are in the description what

110
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,329
do you do I call this stem so these are

111
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,430
dicots that are producing wood heartwood

112
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,069
and sapwood are two examples so let's

113
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,079
get into these a little bit more detail

114
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:24,870
well produces secondary xylem which is

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,189
wood older trees have a visually

116
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,600
distinctive sections here

117
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,250
we see the heartwood is the darker wood

118
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,560
in the center and that's located in this

119
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,870
region right here the SAP wood is

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
located towards the outside it contains

121
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,790
still function in xylem you see here

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,060
this lighter portion is the SAP wood the

123
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,760
annual ring marks are lines that are

124
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,139
between dark late wood and lighter early

125
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,449
word and that's what's causing the

126
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,069
annual rings we can use these rings to

127
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,740
determine a little bit of history of

128
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:55,420
what this particular tree had gone

129
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,680
through you see I took a little arrow

130
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,569
here and it's kind of pointed one of the

131
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,519
annual rings they're looking at a

132
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,349
microscopic view we have the primary

133
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,379
xylem here on the inside the pith in the

134
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,560
direct center the wood region here which

135
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:10,240
is made up of the secondary xylem then

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,889
we have the vascular cambium again where

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,689
our phloem and xylem are being produced

138
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,300
this would be considered in general the

139
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,939
bark region and our phloem would be here

140
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,240
on only the outside I gave the example

141
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:24,069
of people who go around and particularly

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,629
in areas they get a lot of snow and

143
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,889
don't want to cut down trees to dry them

144
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,529
they want to leave them standing timber

145
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,589
they will go around they'll cut into the

146
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:34,629
entire circumference of the tree still

147
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:36,099
leaving the tree vertical but what they

148
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:38,560
do is when they cut into that with a saw

149
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,660
they're breaking all the flow they're

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,699
eliminating all of the sugar transport

151
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,189
by eliminating the sugar transport that

152
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:47,500
tree will eventually die over time it

153
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,668
will dry out and in the winter while

154
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,860
there's snow on the ground they can go

155
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:52,990
through and cut down those trees because

156
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,160
they're dry if you have a wood stove or

157
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,900
no one that does you don't want to

158
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,400
freshly cut a tree down and burn it will

159
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,739
produce a lot of smoke a lot of SAP

160
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,239
doesn't burn very efficiently having dry

161
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,970
wood is definitely much more

162
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,500
advantageous and by cutting just the

163
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,750
phloem and leaving the tree standing

164
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,779
it's easy to find the trees in a thick

165
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,079
snow pack it also dries the wood out so

166
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,279
it burns efficiently

167
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,810
now comparison between dicots and

168
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,549
monocots tabs I try to do this quick

169
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,189
division here these would be the die

170
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,500
cuts here on the left there's to be the

171
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:25,000
monocots here on the right you can see

172
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,250
that much more scattered approach in

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,110
monocots die cuts definitely keeping

174
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,600
those vascular bundles towards the

175
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,080
perimeter only having a large central

176
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,970
pith region zoomed out a little bit so

177
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,829
now just looking at one portion here we

178
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,690
see our monocots and dicots again

179
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:40,990
remember those vascular bundles in both

180
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,819
case

181
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,250
is contains Island to the inside you

182
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,639
phloem to the outside Wow but we see the

183
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,860
dicots organized all along perimeter and

184
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,360
monocots scattered throughout to give

185
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,129
you that in a kind of a cartoon kind of

186
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,050
representative image of our dicots and

187
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,329
monocots stems this is how they would

188
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,660
look I could see him very much the same

189
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:04,889
like the quality microscopic images that

190
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,890
I chose to present earlier
