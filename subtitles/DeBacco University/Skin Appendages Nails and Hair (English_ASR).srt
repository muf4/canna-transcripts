1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,250
okay here we're looking at skin

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:09,269
appendages specifically nails and hair

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,679
for this particular video series so it's

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,539
gonna pandas there's many of them to

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,469
derive from the epidermis but extend

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,959
into the dermis

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:18,600
they include nails hair and hair

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,580
follicles sebaceous glands and sweat

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,699
glands this video we're going to focus

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:27,000
on nails and hair in particular see here

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,820
is true for both humans and also other

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,829
animals and also nails and this is here

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,829
we're going to be focusing in hair

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,210
follicles and just hair in general so

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,500
we've seen this before if you've seen

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,359
some of the other videos or if you

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,340
haven't hopefully this is starting to

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,079
make a little bit more sense here what

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,910
we're going to focus on if it doesn't

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,210
make sense now play the end of the video

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,259
you'll start to pick up some of these

22
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,969
structures of the skin if you don't

23
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,469
understand them a little bit more if you

24
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,000
want to learn more about these I have

25
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,670
other videos going over some more

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,780
details so starting with this one nails

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,500
we're just going to do a brief overview

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,539
of nails and there's scale like

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,849
modifications of the epidermis and made

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,859
of hard keratin there that really hard

31
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,319
kind of keratin they correspond with

32
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,560
hooves and claws and they grow from a

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,118
nail matrix so if you look at your nails

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,859
is how it looks out cut away might be a

35
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,509
little gross there but that's a cutaway

36
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,060
of your nail and it's a protective

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,750
region there on the top it's really the

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,859
same stuff as hooves and also the claws

39
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,719
of the cat here so are here filamentous

40
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,180
strands have dead keratinized cells

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,158
produced by hair follicles so is hair

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,900
alive you know it's kind of made up of

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,640
dead cells there

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,409
it contains hard keratin which is

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,019
tougher and more durable than soft

46
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,420
keratin of the skin so it does continue

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:49,978
to grow here this is our we have our

48
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,439
vessels here our arteries and our veins

49
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,500
at the very base nerve endings down here

50
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,728
and then hair will continue to grow and

51
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,849
trued out the surface hair continued

52
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:01,590
down now what's the function of hair and

53
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,048
where is it where is it found

54
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,659
well the functions are really to

55
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,039
maintain warmth as we see here it also

56
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,689
alerts the body in the presence of

57
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,189
insects on the skin attacks these little

58
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,169
appendages when something crawls on us

59
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,039
or lands on us in this case you can

60
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,348
alert the body

61
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,438
get that insect away hurts the scalp

62
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:22,318
against physical trauma he in sunlight

63
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:23,848
it's a protective layer there see here

64
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:28,229
the sheep here definitely for a wool for

65
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:28,649
the heat retention where is it found on

66
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,060
the body

67
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,280
well it's distributed over the entire

68
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,069
skin surface except for certain areas

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,408
the palms and soles and lips are areas

70
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,750
that's not found nipples and portions of

71
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:43,679
external genitalia also it's not found

72
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:47,939
these are a few exceptions where hair is

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,349
not distributed amongst the body the

74
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,719
basic hair anatomy I'm not going to go

75
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:54,060
into great detail on this but there are

76
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,739
different layers parts is a blended up

77
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,170
before it's a root embedded within the

78
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,219
skin and the shaft projects above the

79
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,750
skin's surface there's three main layers

80
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:05,549
see this black and white image here the

81
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,280
module is the main center portion it's

82
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:12,030
the core we have the cortex and then the

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,128
cuticle on the outside now here is dead

84
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,989
it's keratinized if you look at the

85
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:18,539
basic subunit the basic building block

86
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,609
is actually made from amino acids and

87
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,739
those amino acids get coiled and it coil

88
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,040
on top of coils put together to form the

89
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:29,128
hair why is hair so strong was this

90
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,289
multiple kind of twisting binding coiled

91
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:33,268
layers if you kind of want to prove this

92
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:36,358
to yourself you could take a paper towel

93
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,799
roll and just take one of the paper

94
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,650
towels and now pulling the paper towel

95
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,209
you'll know so tear very easily if you

96
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,519
take that same paper towel and start to

97
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,039
twist it you turn it and then try to

98
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,870
pull on it it's going to be a lot harder

99
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,370
that kind of what the reason of the

100
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,709
supporting reason for why these

101
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,659
filaments are so strong is that twisting

102
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,109
and turning the same thing works with

103
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,489
toilet paper so the hair follicle we

104
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,079
have a little zoomed in here the root

105
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,900
sheath extends from the epidermal

106
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,519
surface into the dermis and bending hair

107
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,219
stimulates the endings hence the hair

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,039
access touch touch sensitive receptors

109
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,289
so I mentioned that down here we have

110
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,269
nerves that attach to that and by

111
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:17,098
bending the the end here that it's being

112
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,408
transferred and that's what's alerting

113
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:20,399
us to something present on our skin such

114
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:25,589
as an insect

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:27,839
for example goosebumps the erector pili

116
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:30,479
muscle we're located right here

117
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,709
it's a bundle of smooth muscle now if

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,830
you haven't learned about muscles yet

119
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,839
smooth muscle is an involuntary muscle

120
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:39,899
and it contracts and makes the hair

121
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,000
stand erect so when it contracts that's

122
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,709
the muscle shrinking so that's shrinking

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,029
or getting basically the muscles are

124
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:47,430
sliding over one another and pulled

125
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,949
together that's going to take that here

126
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,019
I'm going to stand it up reason why it

127
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,930
does this is it separates out it creates

128
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:56,579
a little barrier here stops air from

129
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,490
getting a direct contact with the

130
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,560
surface at least a little bit of our

131
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,460
factor here and what that does is that

132
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,519
have coats the skin here and allows it

133
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,529
to stay a little bit warmer also muscles

134
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,060
contracting take energy that's also

135
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:14,129
going to journey a little bit more heat

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,990
so not only does this kind of lift the

137
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,959
area and create an insulating factor

138
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,120
that buffer factor between the cold air

139
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,680
and the skin it also generates a little

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,060
heat from all these muscles contracting

141
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,220
I'm going to do a little math here with

142
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,079
hair growth hair loss or first talked

143
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,180
about the positive here of hair growth

144
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,459
hair growth this is just marriage it

145
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,699
found about two millimeters per week

146
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:40,589
this is active growing hair now I posed

147
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,990
a question here how long in days would

148
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,429
it take for your hair to grow to six

149
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,038
inches which is estimated to be about

150
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,129
ear length or thirty inches about hip

151
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:53,279
length in this case as growth rate of

152
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:54,990
two milliliters per week now your hair

153
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,079
may grow faster a little slower but

154
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,220
using this figure how could we calculate

155
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,319
this I'm going to walk you through some

156
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,880
of the basic math if you're taking

157
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,550
chemistry dimensional analysis is what

158
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,038
I'm going to be using so time with our

159
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,840
math calculations well two milliliters

160
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,639
per week is what's given we got to

161
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,199
convert that to centimeters we're going

162
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,829
to do millimeters to a centimeter

163
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,300
conversion so we take our millimeters to

164
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:20,399
convert to centimeters we want

165
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,750
millimeters to cancel so input there's

166
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,029
milliliters in the numerator there's

167
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,709
milliner's in the denominator here one

168
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,449
centimeter is equal to ten millimeters

169
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:30,089
now we're going to convert our

170
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,800
millimeters are cancelled out we have

171
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,489
centimeters we want centimeters to

172
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,430
inches while 2.54 centimeters is the

173
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,978
same as one inch so our centimeters

174
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,819
cancel out we're left with inches per

175
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:43,949
week

176
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,230
now what I was asking for though now I

177
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:49,199
want to calculate we know canceled weeks

178
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,300
in calculating days so one week is seven

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,909
days so I put this in green here this

180
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,430
week cancels with this week because one

181
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,189
week is the same as seven days we

182
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,019
multiply all our numerators we get to

183
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:03,180
multiply all our denominators we get one

184
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,279
seventy seven point eight two divided by

185
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,030
one seventy seven point eight equals

186
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,489
0.001 one two four eight inches per day

187
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,549
so how do we calculate what I asked it

188
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,319
six inches well six inches if you're

189
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,920
growing it this much per day it'll take

190
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,529
approximately 533 days for your hair to

191
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,319
grow six inches if it rose two

192
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:28,079
millimeters per week I also add another

193
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,459
thing what if it grows 30 inches well to

194
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,689
get to 30 inches it's gonna be two

195
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,239
thousand six hundred and seventy seven

196
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,269
days so that makes a little bit more

197
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,680
sense we convert cancel days out those

198
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,319
are just three and sixty five days in a

199
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,850
year or to grow 30 inches got the rate

200
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,529
of two milliliters per week it would

201
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,060
take about seven point three years and

202
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,039
here's just the map again give me a

203
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,439
little bit of the background to provide

204
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,410
you with how I got to that answer

205
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,029
located down here moving on a little bit

206
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,610
more of a negative hair loss the

207
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,659
thinning that's typically age-related

208
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,460
male pattern baldness

209
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,160
there's also female pattern baldness as

210
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,479
we see here the progression the

211
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,730
incidence of male pattern baldness by

212
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,819
age the percent of the population you

213
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,220
know said it increases as the age also

214
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,290
increases advanced is this blue region

215
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,350
moderate is this kind of yellow region

216
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,689
in early stages that dark burgundy type

217
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,000
region there so you see as males tend to

218
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:26,430
get older the percent of the population

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,019
that have some instance of male pattern

220
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,009
baldness increases overall now we're

221
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,348
talking about here we talked about

222
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,849
pigmentation hair color we'll hair color

223
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,370
facts to start with the facts

224
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,290
well fermentation is by the melanocytes

225
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,720
and they're at the base of the hair the

226
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,809
amount of melanin for black or brown

227
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,779
it's distinctive melanin for red hair

228
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:51,059
white is a decrease in Valinor and air

229
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,129
bubbles in that the medulla of the hair

230
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,569
causing it to have its white parents

231
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:56,950
losing its color essentially

232
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,980
this is genetically determined to the

233
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,600
influence of hormones in the environment

234
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,340
however if you I'll probably hurt hair

235
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,230
color there's these bunch of stereotypes

236
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,810
out there so I put a picture of just

237
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,860
three different people with me sorry

238
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:10,929
four different people with four

239
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,200
different types of hair color blonde are

240
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:15,819
usually considered fun and social or

241
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,160
negative would be unintelligent

242
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,800
brunettes typically are seen as

243
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,779
intelligent and mature and the negatives

244
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,609
are typically seen as plain black is

245
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,350
mysterious and hard workers or

246
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,330
untrustworthy and a negative side

247
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,940
redheads being unique and interesting

248
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,580
but also as a negative as aggressive

249
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,290
I found these these are stereotypes none

250
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,960
of these really have any science that

251
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:41,019
hold true but if you look at these four

252
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,150
images do you kind of see how these

253
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,340
stereotypes can get generated and again

254
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:48,179
this is just people progressing these

255
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,110
stereotypes they don't hold true at all

256
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:53,409
one thing that does hold true this is

257
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,090
particularly for redheads kind of a

258
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:58,360
quick fat redheads are actually harder

259
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:01,540
to sedate than other hair groups using

260
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,269
the most common in aesthetics sorry they

261
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:06,639
require an average of 20% more in its

262
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,139
diva that's also they also have a higher

263
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,199
talents than normal people which is

264
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:14,500
other hair colors to pain

265
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,100
this is because of the melanin court

266
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,529
according one receptor it's a mutation

267
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,070
that gives red hair and also triggers

268
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:26,079
excessive release of feel melanin which

269
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,670
is among other things Tim that's the

270
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,250
brain receptor related to pain

271
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,750
sensitivity so just kind of interesting

272
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,299
know about the redheads now there's not

273
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,539
many of them 1 to 2% of the world's

274
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:39,009
population is naturally has red hair

275
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,379
National Geographic made a prediction

276
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,929
that by the Year 2060 redheads would be

277
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:45,009
extinct so interesting there in this

278
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,620
case a little bit of the largest

279
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,590
population groups Scotland 13% are

280
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,929
natural redheads Ireland 10% Wales up to

281
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,680
10% in the United States only about 2 to

282
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:59,019
6% are natural redheads reason why I

283
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,269
bring this up is this came up in an

284
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,429
article I put down here for there's

285
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:06,039
little demand demand for a redhead and

286
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,689
it's sperm fur makes wanted to turn down

287
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,599
redheads because they weren't getting

288
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,240
did

289
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,800
and for that sperm the world's largest

290
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,620
firm bakes started turning down redheads

291
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,599
donors due to the small demand well

292
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,429
there's other ethical issues but this

293
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,930
should be easy right if there's a male

294
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,578
it's redhead they're just going to deny

295
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:25,370
them and that should eliminate the

296
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:28,269
redhead genes from the population well

297
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,399
it's actually not that easy so

298
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,470
illuminating redhead genotype you can't

299
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,690
really be an redhead sperm because yes

300
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,370
okay the male is red it's showing that

301
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,560
but remember from our hardy-weinberg

302
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,629
equations there's also a lot of people

303
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,239
that are carriers because there's more

304
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:46,899
carriers in actual redheads there's

305
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,089
actually a lot of the redhead gene

306
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,429
located within the population that

307
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,889
allele is actually very common as a lot

308
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:58,338
of carriers even though not many express

309
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:00,230
it so what sounded effective is actually

310
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,019
have supporting science so being redhead

311
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,310
sperm donors has really a small effect

312
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,049
since the policy of banning redheads we

313
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:07,489
see that there is a decrease but not

314
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:10,698
nearly as dramatically there was no

315
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,680
policy so just an interesting fact here

316
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:15,109
how we had that allele that's carried

317
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,809
many people are carriers that simply

318
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,339
what sounded easy to be in redheads to

319
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:22,309
eliminate that from the sperm Beck did

320
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:24,589
not actually hold true so for that gives

321
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:27,859
you a little bit of the science and kind

322
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:31,180
of some of the stereotypes and also some

323
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:36,370
of the background on hair color and

324
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:36,370
nails as these appendages of the skin
