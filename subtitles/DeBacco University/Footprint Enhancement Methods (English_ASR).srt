1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
so here we're looking at footprint

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,120
enhancement we see a great example of

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,960
that here

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,638
we have sequential chemical enhancement

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
of footwear impressions

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,480
in blood on white polyester using

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,839
luminol

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,519
neohydrin and acid black one so this

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,000
kind of gives you an idea of how we can

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,719
enhance or change that kind of

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,399
footprint to be able to show certain

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,320
characteristics

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,598
so however when we're looking at

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,278
enhancement in general

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,199
one word of caution is i want to be

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,880
careful with any enhancement methods

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,239
that we might be implementing

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,679
why because these may damage the

19
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,879
original prints which can lead to

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,039
destruction of evidence

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,239
and possible disqualification from being

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,679
used in court

23
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,359
here we have an original photograph here

24
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,439
we have an enhanced one

25
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,600
at a certain point of where's the line

26
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,519
of over enhancing something

27
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
so again just word of caution only use

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,160
this if you need to

29
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,198
don't use this as a default method so

30
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,679
post initial photography methods

31
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,799
so if footprint is made in blood color

32
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,399
changing reagents can help

33
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,000
visualize the prints these can be

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,760
physical methods such as latent powder

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,640
lifting impressions or impressions

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
on paper a lot of these are found in

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,719
easy to carry kits

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,079
to a crime scene we also have dusting

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,000
for footprints so just like we would

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,438
dust for fingerprints the same can be

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,879
applied to footprints

42
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,559
and you can use the same powder even

43
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,158
fingerprint powder can be

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
visualized prints using the same basic

45
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,240
procedures as you would for fingerprints

46
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,399
lifted with adhesive or gelatin and

47
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,319
photograph then to be included

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
as evidence so something that may

49
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,839
initially be really hard to see you can

50
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,520
kind of see it sort of kind of

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,118
with that with that adding of

52
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,519
fingerprint powder it becomes

53
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,040
much clearer we also have something

54
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,239
called electrostatic

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
lifting which is an aggressive technique

56
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,559
to recover

57
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,399
impressions typically used on hard

58
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,000
surfaces such as tile or wood

59
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,599
there's basically a charge used to lift

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,399
dry materials from a surface

61
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,798
to a black film this lift will provide

62
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,799
more contrast and is non-destructive

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
and then it can be photographed and

64
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,240
entered as evidence

65
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,759
placards or markers are used to document

66
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,078
locations of impressions

67
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,959
if possible remove and transport those

68
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,199
impressions

69
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,038
those electrostatic just lifting devices

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,560
operate by charging a plastic film

71
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,639
placed over a dust pan

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,318
which creates electrostatic adhesions

73
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,119
into a film surface

74
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,238
showing the print now casting of prints

75
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
this is kind of

76
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
simple requires a little bit of a kind

77
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,159
of carrying of this bulk material

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
but it can pick up really it can pick up

79
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,759
detail very well

80
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
material is very durable this casting

81
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,560
and it can be cast

82
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,560
after its photographs you should always

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
take photographs first then make a cast

84
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,878
and if you want to take photographs

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,879
after

86
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,318
typically this casting material is kind

87
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,239
of a basis of

88
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,518
some sort of dental stone because it

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,599
allows a

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
really strong structure to be made but

91
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,439
allows also the

92
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
retaining of certain details and

93
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,560
products can be sprayed with colorized

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,158
wax to aid in highlighting

95
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,280
those prints now impression enhancements

96
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,000
so poor impressions can sometimes are

97
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
made

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,439
and may have to be enhanced by the

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
following means so initially it might be

100
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,560
really hard to see the details

101
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
so you can offer some of these

102
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,840
enhancements particularly for

103
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,920
the purpose of photography

104
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,519
oblique ultraviolet infrared or other

105
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,199
special methods can be used

106
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
here we see kind of a snow print simply

107
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,359
using a coloration

108
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,239
to create a greater contrast can really

109
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
help provide

110
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
an exposure to some of those details

111
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,479
that can be more easily

112
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,519
photographed now chemical enhancement

113
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,039
methods

114
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,719
looking at chemical enhancement reagents

115
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,719
such as crystal violet luminol

116
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,318
dehydration may also be used we saw this

117
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,560
on the title slide

118
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,318
the difference you can get with these

119
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
certain chemical enhancement

120
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
methods then we also have digital

121
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
enhancement

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,959
software such as like photoshop can be

123
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
used to enhance

124
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,438
impressions but remember there is a fine

125
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,199
line between overdoing the enhancement

126
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,878
here we see women in the woods we see

127
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,479
kind of left and right we see that kind

128
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,079
of enhancement of color

129
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,518
here we see probably a photoshop that's

130
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
gone a little too

131
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,719
far so again keep in mind that digital

132
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,239
enhancement methods

133
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,479
should only be used if absolutely

134
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
necessary and kind of as a last resort

135
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,079
because it could eliminate them from

136
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,479
being included as evidenced in a court

137
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
setting
