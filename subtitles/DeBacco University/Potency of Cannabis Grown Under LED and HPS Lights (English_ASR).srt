1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,679
going to explore the potency of cannabis

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
grown under led

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,638
and hps lights based on a scientific

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,719
article so this is a debate that

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,599
constantly goes on so let's look at some

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:19,439
scientific research and see how this

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,440
changes the potency of cannabis

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,719
[Music]

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,079
all right let's get into this highly

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,679
debated subject led versus hps lights so

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
first off this is the research article

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,439
here's the links provided fairly

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
recently published and so if you want to

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,399
go back to the original article here you

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,558
go i'm going to kind of break it down

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,719
and give you the summary of it here

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:48,078
so first off this is the great debate

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,000
hps high pressure sodiums versus led

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,000
lights however most people do not

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,079
consider this to be a debate they feel

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,759
that led lights or nothing this is kind

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,198
of the wave of the future these are the

24
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,960
old school methods they only want to

25
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,960
grow under led lights and this is kind

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
of part of that debate and to some

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,960
extent but let's look at it from a

28
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,280
scientific standpoint here

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,759
so first off this article compared these

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,159
different lights here they had one hps

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,520
light the e papillonian 1000 watt double

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,880
ended hps and then they had three led

33
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,438
lights that they were looking at in

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,319
comparison um comparing here i should

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,399
say

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,158
this is all the lights part of the study

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,520
however after their comparison of the

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,640
led lights then there were only two

39
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,560
they kept with the of course high

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,478
pressure sodium for comparison and they

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,960
kept the fluids bioengineering which is

42
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,000
now known by influenced by osram the

43
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,000
spider

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
plus led lights the first part of the

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
study really was geared to evaluating

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
leading led light manufacturers and

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
models to identify which option provides

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,118
the most uniform distribution of the

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
light at the leaf

50
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,478
at the leaf and canopy as well as the

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,719
important

52
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,200
factor at producing a consistent end

53
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,359
product so they wanted a basically the

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
best of the best for led lights at least

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,799
in their uh

56
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,039
measurements of their data collection

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
the fluence by osram the spyder x plus

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,360
model clearly demonstrate optimum light

59
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,038
distribution photosynthetic response and

60
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,759
also maintain leaf temperature within

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,000
the optimum range to achieve maximum

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,759
photosynthetic rates so that's why they

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,159
chose that one over the others just to

64
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,239
go back for a second for the two others

65
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,840
that were presented here this ultimately

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,319
is the led light that they compare to

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,239
this high pressure sodium there

68
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,598
so let's get into some of the data here

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
probably the most interesting part was

70
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,199
figure four in this study all the

71
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,598
cannabis cultivars grown under led

72
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,959
lights yielded an increase of thca

73
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,919
percentage with an average increase of

74
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,120
5.39 percent the mean of 25.06 percent

75
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,199
thca under eight led lights versus only

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,120
19.67

77
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,119
under high pressure sodium lights here

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,000
so it shows you the potency and provided

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,759
that yes led lights does yield a

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
greater percentage of thca however most

81
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,439
squares would stop here and say throw

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
out all their ap hps and go with leds

83
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,959
but let's just explore this just a

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,239
little bit further

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,319
so first off what does this generally

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,158
mean to the growers many growers would

87
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,958
think that led lights would yield them

88
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,719
more thca which is when while this study

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,319
did show that there are

90
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,560
did show this there are other factors

91
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,399
that must be taken into consideration

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,318
with indoor facilities there are other

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
environmental control factors that need

94
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,518
to be optimized to ensure quality

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,878
harvest temperature humidity

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,480
regulating that temperature keeping

97
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,039
within tight ranges

98
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,878
the intensity of the light the

99
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,400
area that the light covers there's a lot

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,919
of other factors that need to be taken

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
into consideration

102
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,679
so just don't think that led lights is

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,959
going to be your only way to get high

104
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,879
thc a levels in this example now thca in

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,840
lighting to break the 30 percent or even

106
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,000
35 percent total thc theoretical barrier

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
one does not need led lights as this can

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,239
be done with high pressure sodium lights

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,158
used during flowering so just understand

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,400
that 30 is kind of that theoretical

111
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,000
barrier even 35 percent seeing test

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
results that show

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,799
flower that does have higher than 30

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,719
percent thc total thc and that is they

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,120
are grown under hps light so i think you

116
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,120
have to have led lights led lighting

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
though can help this but all factors

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
must be taken into consideration

119
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,199
especially coverage area and related par

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,399
readings as well as feeding schedules as

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,239
well as

122
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,719
stresses and non-stresses to the

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,560
cannabis plant and again to prove these

124
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,280
total amounts we're looking of course at

125
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
getting an analytical report a third

126
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,279
party tested so we know exactly what

127
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,719
those values are coming in at

128
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,039
now for the growers general

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,800
considerations so just keep this in mind

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,720
that sure led light technology may be

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
the way of the future but at the current

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,960
time taking into full cost of initially

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,079
purchasing ownership and number of

134
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:49,198
fixtures needed hps is still price

135
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,959
competitive so keeping that in mind

136
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
there's a lot of other factors that can

137
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,359
consideration in a grow facility led

138
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,119
lights led lights do offer the advantage

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,199
of being full spectrum at least in some

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,639
cases so growers can see the plants in

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,879
their true

142
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,038
form basically without the need for any

143
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,478
filtering lenses and there may be some

144
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,879
beneficial wavelengths of the light

145
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,360
produced that can aid in cannabis plants

146
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,439
ability to produce certain compounds at

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
greater concentrations than grown under

148
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,600
other lighting but this does not mean

149
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,758
hps lights are useless and if available

150
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,479
to growers they should still continue to

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,639
utilize them because we have to consider

152
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,918
yes we've got a lot of other factors

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,478
we've got some more heat of course with

154
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,038
hps lights but a lot of times to get the

155
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,279
full power reading coverage area of a

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,918
thousand watt double ended hps you may

157
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,679
need to purchase more led fixtures so

158
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,680
again that needs to be kept in mind

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
there as well as the other kind of

160
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,280
changing over of electrical panels we

161
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,759
need to keep all of those various cost

162
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,679
repairs maintenance all in mind when

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
we're looking at a grow facility

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,439
so what's the general take home message

165
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,599
of this article well many companies

166
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,519
produce led lights but in general you

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
want to live by the motto that good led

168
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,399
lights are not cheap and cheap led

169
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,560
lights are not good hps lights can still

170
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,638
produce quality canvas and for the cost

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
are worth serious consideration

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,120
by more growers i'm not saying that led

173
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,879
lights are bad just look at the full

174
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
cost there a lot of people say oh led

175
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,759
lights run

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,439
with less wattage

177
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,360
they need less cooling and that may be

178
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,439
true but just keep in mind the mounting

179
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,879
heights as well a lot of times led

180
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,360
lights do need to be closer to the

181
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,159
planes to be effective or if if you

182
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,720
increase that spacing your coverage area

183
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,960
may not be as great so look at the full

184
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,520
picture when considering light changes

185
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,038
but if you have access to hps sites

186
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,680
don't consider them to be a horrible

187
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,038
option they may be a great option for

188
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
you to utilize

189
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,120
and may be actually more cost effective

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,120
in some cases than led lights
