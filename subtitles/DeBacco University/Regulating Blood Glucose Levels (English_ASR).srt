1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay here we're investigating how the

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,258
body goes about regulating blood glucose

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,809
levels how it has ways to both raise and

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,530
also lower these glucose levels to be

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,388
able to maintain homeostasis so we're

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,608
going to focus on the organ of the

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,618
pancreas the pancreas is located behind

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,480
the stomach it secretes a number of

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,149
digestive enzymes into the small

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,528
intestine to a narrow tube however we're

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,288
going to focus on the islets of

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,948
langerhans within the pancreas which

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,560
govern

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,480
blood glucose levels insulin is a

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,199
hormone that promotes the accumulation

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:40,558
of glucagon in liver in triglycerides in

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,109
fat cells also there's agon which

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,109
is causes the release of stored glucose

19
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:49,170
in fat breakdown so how does this look

20
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,570
well if we have too much glucose in our

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,660
blood after eating for example a high

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,759
sugar carbohydrate based diet insulin

23
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,009
will put Lucas into cells

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,049
so insulin puts insulin into cells

25
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,228
basically adipose cells take up the

26
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,819
sugar then we exercise we don't eat for

27
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,188
a while this will cause a decrease in

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,769
our blood sugar levels this will then

29
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:13,699
cause the pancreas to release glucagon

30
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:16,859
which will Stu may deliver to break down

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,978
the sugar and put it into glucose and

32
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:22,920
increase our blood sugar levels now then

33
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,810
we consume another sugar based diet here

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,090
that'll cause insulin to be produced to

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,469
put the glucose back into cells the

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,650
exercise for a while it's the how this

37
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,969
goes around and around yeah some ways

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,280
where this doesn't work properly it

39
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,959
would be diabetes it's affected

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,810
individuals cannot take up glucose in

41
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,868
the blood there's type 1 and type 2

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,379
diabetes type 1 is only about 5 to 10

43
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:48,299
percent of diabetics it's an autoimmune

44
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,750
disorder in which the immune system

45
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,790
attacks the islets of langerhans this

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,159
typically developed for the age of 22

47
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,790
often called juvenile onset diabetes is

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,109
treated by daily injections of insulin

49
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,118
so here's that normal condition where

50
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:06,899
boosting insulins being received glucose

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,459
uptake a metal cell here in type 1 we

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,530
have an autoimmune disorder where a

53
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,090
Technos outs of linked hands insulin is

54
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,800
not being produced even though it's a

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,110
fully functional receptor

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,850
so through those daily injections those

57
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,780
individuals can help correct correct

58
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,000
that deficiency

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,159
however type 2 diabetes which is the

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,590
vast majority is caused by abnormally

61
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,389
low number of insulin receptors this

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,370
develops typically after the age of 40

63
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,919
and as a result is called adult onset

64
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,319
diabetes typically you know piece

65
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,019
individuals this is treated usually by

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,750
diet or exercise because there's simply

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,640
a demand low number of insulin receptors

68
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,360
even though infants being produced at a

69
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,279
normal rate yeah there's too much

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,210
glucose in the blood insulin converts

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,580
some of them of it to my kitchen so we

72
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,420
see our glucose in the blood

73
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,370
lottie's gonna want to convert some of

74
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,919
that to the clock again so we have our

75
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,990
insulin being produced there's nothing

76
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,399
to take some of that and put it into

77
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,439
glycogen to be stored

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,879
just to see that again here's our

79
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,609
glucose in the blood very high levels

80
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,849
insulin is being released taking some of

81
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,200
that up and storing it as glycogen now

82
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,239
again the opposites occurred if there's

83
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,829
not enough glucose in the blood glycogen

84
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,180
converts some of that into glucose

85
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,250
here's our glycogen so our gluten that

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,129
actually looks like we're going to take

87
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,240
this break them down and it's going to

88
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:35,129
put them into the bloodstream so again

89
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,530
insulin is taking blood out of the blood

90
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,199
vessels been into storage and glucagon

91
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,709
is taking that and breaking it apart so

92
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,359
that there is some Lucas now how the

93
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,189
blood glucose level changes over time

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,770
we're looking at specifically a day here

95
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:52,409
we see during our meals we have this

96
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:55,530
insulin levels increasing increasing to

97
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:58,530
help reduce the keep our blood glucose

98
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,469
in a very tight range as the body tries

99
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,849
to maintain homeostasis so initially

100
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:05,699
well this may look like very large

101
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,939
spikes this is occurring in a very tight

102
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,310
range helping the body maintain

103
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:12,840
homeostasis you can see here again our

104
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,239
our blood to tarp increase here's our

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,480
liver we're having an increase in blood

106
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,129
sugar glue guns being released we have

107
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,109
that low blood sugar so what increase

108
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,389
our blood sugar here who then is

109
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,259
responsible for that that's causing the

110
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:31,120
breakdown here

111
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:34,689
then our insulin is put in our glucose

112
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,220
into storage so into those cells this is

113
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:38,560
a result of high blood sugar insulin

114
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,500
want to decrease our blood sugar it's

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,720
putting it into storage and the loop

116
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,490
goes around and around typically you

117
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
have to eat a high sugar diet to feel a

118
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,180
lot of candy you may have a lot of

119
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,340
energy I'm feel very energetic because

120
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,769
you have high blood sugar insulin will

121
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:56,169
be produced innocence typically can be

122
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:58,599
related to the sugar crash reason being

123
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:02,140
insulin may overshoot and may over

124
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,000
produce too much and causing it decrease

125
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,810
in your blood sugar causing you to lose

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,639
your energy

127
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,589
glucagon will then take a little while

128
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,199
to get started to help release some of

129
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:13,209
that blood sugar and this is kind of

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,259
going back before to help your body

131
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:16,259
maintain homeostasis
