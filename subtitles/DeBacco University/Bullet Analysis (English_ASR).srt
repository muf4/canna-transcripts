1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
so here i'm going to go over bullet

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,120
analysis because typically this may be

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,120
found at the crime scene

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,480
and how do you go about analyzing this

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,039
and what do you kind of look for in the

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,120
bullet

7
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,798
and also i'll cover the cartridge just

8
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,399
for a little bit because there are some

9
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,838
similar markings

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,440
so first off the bullet anatomy is

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,278
important to understand

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,880
first off the bullet remembers the

13
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,480
actual projectile

14
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,640
so it's actually the point that's being

15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
fired the case is the holding container

16
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
the powder the charge is the source of

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,559
the explosion energy the primer is the

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
igniter that's

19
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,199
the initiates the whole the process the

20
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,640
wad for shotgun shells is a plastic

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
separator between the pellets and the

22
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,679
powder

23
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,359
we see that located here note this is

24
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,039
present in shotgun shell blanks and

25
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,519
could potentially be deadly at close

26
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,039
range

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,559
so even if you have a shotgun shell

28
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,359
blank meaning it doesn't contain any

29
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,599
bullets

30
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,119
the water that plastic portion does come

31
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
out of the barrel with quite some force

32
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,878
if you're in close range that can be

33
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,919
deadly so don't think again that a

34
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,878
shotgun shell blink

35
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,600
is necessarily not deadly that wad can

36
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,000
definitely

37
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,840
um if it impacts someone can definitely

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,879
cause death

39
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,478
now the rifling so we're talking about a

40
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
bullet we want to be thinking about the

41
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,079
rifling of the barrel that it's

42
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,159
traveling through so in firearms that

43
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,000
rifling is that helical kind of grooves

44
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
that are machined in the inter

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,118
interior or bore surface of the gun's

46
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:18,798
barrel

47
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,400
so we see the barrel here we see a cut

48
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,479
away a nice little cut away

49
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,719
located right over here you can see that

50
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,118
rifling that rifling causes the bullet

51
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,640
to spin the projectile around the

52
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,799
longitudinal axis during

53
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,200
shooting to help it stabilize it's kind

54
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,799
of like throwing a spiral on a football

55
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
but when it goes through this kind of

56
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
travels here at a very high rated speed

57
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,118
it is spinning

58
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
there is going to be some markings that

59
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,560
do occur

60
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,680
so looking at gun barrel rifling well

61
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
traditionally sharpens

62
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
lands in grooves are replaced by less

63
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
pronounced hills and valleys so the

64
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,359
barrel bore has a

65
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,560
kind of polygonal or hexagonal or

66
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,799
octagonal cross

67
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,320
section profile we kind of see here

68
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
eight conventional groove rifling on the

69
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,279
left

70
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,959
and octagonal piling rifling on the

71
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
right so there are some slight

72
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,158
differences

73
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,118
that can occur but these differences if

74
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,040
you know how to

75
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,318
look and identify them can help you

76
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
correlate or match

77
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,560
up the potential barrel that was fired

78
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,000
from that bullet traveled through

79
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
there's also something called glock

80
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,919
rifling which is

81
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,120
a some weapons glock pistols is just a

82
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,359
name brand

83
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
do not make usable striation patterns on

84
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
fire bullets because they use that

85
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,479
polygonal rifling instead of the

86
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,479
conventional rifling

87
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,919
so one group of eight consecutive

88
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,399
matching strike in

89
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,598
agreement would be considered a match

90
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
matching evidence

91
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,759
for tool marks for this type of rifling

92
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
basically you're going to have a little

93
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,079
different

94
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,360
pattern that's going to be developing

95
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,120
because of the type

96
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,959
of bore that this rifling kind of has

97
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,719
so it's going to be a little different

98
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
set of rules or build different ways to

99
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,359
be able to match those

100
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,200
bullets up to that particular barrel

101
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480
now the firing pin and ejection mark so

102
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,000
again i know we're getting a little bit

103
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,158
away from the bullet here

104
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but you find the bullet you find the gun

105
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,399
you could find the casing as well

106
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,519
the valk of that cartridge so the firing

107
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
pin

108
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,439
here in little and where a is pointing

109
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,879
to that leaves an impression when it

110
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,079
strikes the primer it's kind of the

111
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,560
hammer point

112
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
uh which strikes the casing cakerges in

113
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
the rim

114
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,119
and of rim fired cartridges so this

115
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,319
would be again a center-fired

116
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
uh casing here um cartridge so this

117
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,039
would be important to kind of identify

118
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,280
if it was rim fired

119
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,798
it'd be off to the side now you might be

120
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,318
looking at b saying well

121
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,920
why is it if it's the center fire

122
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,158
advisor marking here

123
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,598
well b is referring to the ejection mark

124
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,280
they're called when the cartridges are

125
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:40,479
ejected from the firearm and can be used

126
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,799
to confirm passage

127
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,479
through the firearm if found at the

128
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,080
crime scene

129
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,919
we also have chamber marks so these are

130
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
found throughout the outer side

131
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,000
of the casing and are the result of

132
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,559
regulars inside the wall so the firing

133
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
chamber

134
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
so again these are just some different

135
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
patterns that you might see in the

136
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
actual casing

137
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,919
so keep in mind the bullet's going to

138
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,280
have marks that's great place to look

139
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,719
but also do not forget about looking at

140
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,158
the actual casing as well for different

141
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,158
marks

142
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,519
they have breech face marks this is

143
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,878
where there's kind of bold face

144
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,920
signature where that end kind of comes

145
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,840
in contact after

146
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,439
when the explosion occurs and when the

147
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
firearm is discharged this

148
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,639
kind of rearward movement or recoils

149
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
result of the pressure being generated

150
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
in the bullet

151
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,719
going up the barrel but this is coming

152
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
back and you can see there's also some

153
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
distinctive patterns that can be left

154
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
this action at the base of the cartridge

155
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,319
will hit the breach of the firearm

156
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,720
leaving a mark that can be categorized

157
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,360
this can again help you match up

158
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
the potential firearm that fired on that

159
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,319
bullet or that in this case

160
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,519
this particular casing looking

161
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,240
specifically at the bullet there'll be

162
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,959
striations

163
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,400
i mentioned that rifling in the barrel

164
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,120
there's going to be striations left on

165
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,519
that bullet

166
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
this acts as the gun's fingerprint even

167
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,478
the same macon model of firearm will

168
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
produce distinct

169
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,800
striations this pattern will typically

170
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,319
hold true even over time

171
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
so it's really important that when you

172
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,959
recover the bullet you don't do a lot of

173
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
physical damage to it

174
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,839
because these very distinctive

175
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
striations are kind of like the

176
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,918
fingerprint

177
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,520
to that gun as i mentioned those lands

178
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,560
and grooves those will lead to the

179
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,079
rifling

180
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
so it's important that the lands are the

181
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,599
raised portions between the grooves

182
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,038
inside the barrel after the spiral

183
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,840
grooves cut into

184
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,918
and produce the rifling now exactly how

185
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,918
they're oriented or how they're tilted

186
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,120
can tell you if it's a right twist or a

187
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,279
left twist

188
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
of that bullet which again can help you

189
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,279
match up the potential barrel or

190
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,638
firearm to the bullet that it was fired

191
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,959
from

192
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,639
these unique characteristics so the

193
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,319
number of lands in groups usually four

194
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,639
to six but can range from two to twenty

195
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,439
two

196
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,079
just the number can help you again match

197
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,439
them up

198
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,279
the diameter of the lens and grooves is

199
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,038
something you wanna look at the

200
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,359
width of the lens the depth of the lens

201
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,279
and grooves a degree of the twist

202
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
the number twist is the number of inches

203
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,198
the board is required to complete

204
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,000
a rifling spiral and you want to be kind

205
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,478
of using a comparison of a known

206
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,439
and a kind of what was found at the

207
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,120
crime scene

208
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,639
you can see here this kind of matching

209
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,959
occurs typically with a

210
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
comparison microscope because it is

211
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,918
really done on the detail level

212
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
so again you do some unique

213
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,519
characteristics to help you kind of

214
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,279
identify or match up

215
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,799
kind of the fingerprint if you will of

216
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,799
the gun or barrel

217
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,520
to the particular bullet found at the

218
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
crime scene
