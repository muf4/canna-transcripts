1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,318
looking at this nice planting here on a

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,318
large scale of cannabis plants

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,320
we want to consider how we're going to

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,320
manage weeds in between the row

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,638
that's what this video here on debacle

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,879
university will present four methods

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,960
with their advantages and disadvantage

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,210
to even idea what might be a best fit

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:26,399
for your operation

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:27,518
[Music]

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,598
all right let's go through and look at

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,079
between row weed management in a

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,799
cannabis

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,600
field so first off we have the

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,839
cultivation

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
or sterile seed bed technique the

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,719
advantages is that this physically cuts

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,640
the weeds

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,160
and this can reduce weed numbers over

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,840
the course of a season

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,599
and it can be applied on a small scale

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,440
as well as a large scale

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
the disadvantages is that this can be

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,799
challenging in rocky soil because you're

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,479
trying to disturb that top layer

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,479
it needs to be done on a regular

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,558
intervals to really be effective

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,319
this can often be offset by weather

29
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,599
events particularly rain

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,960
to reduce its effectiveness then we get

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,118
to herbicides

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,079
so the advantages of herbicides is that

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,478
they're very time

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,840
efficient method go through spray and

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,280
kind of walk away

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,799
the disadvantages is that there's

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
chemical restrictions for cannabis

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,920
production so that can limit potential

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
use of herbicides

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,799
and there's also the possibility of

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
spray drift that could damage

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
plants that you don't want to have

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
damaged then we get to mowing the

44
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,560
advantage advantages

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is that it helps establish the soil here

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,478
if we're planting a cover crop we can

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,319
mow that down here with a brush hog

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,719
the disadvantages is you need to make

49
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,478
sure that the species are a good match

50
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,000
and not necessarily just weeds but

51
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,599
intended for potential

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
benefits we're looking in between roads

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,399
we plan a nice established nice good

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,239
grass species

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
yes we can mow it and that might be a

56
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,319
really good option we don't just want to

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,759
just mow

58
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,519
quite weeds that we didn't intend on

59
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,478
planting because that could potentially

60
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,118
still build up

61
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,718
high weeds in our fields and then last

62
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,319
we have a physical barrier

63
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,839
so the advantages of a physical bear is

64
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,559
it's very effective uh

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,320
also reduces soil splash and it creates

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
clean walking paths so that can be great

67
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,519
for harvesting it's been great to keep

68
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
plants clean from the bottom

69
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,639
to the top there to eliminate any

70
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
potential soil splash which can also

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,000
potentially reduce disease

72
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,238
the disadvantages is that there's

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,919
initial cost with this setup

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,680
and the setup time in ensuring that the

75
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,919
physical barrier that you're laying down

76
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,159
doesn't get wind blown that only will

77
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,119
reduce its effectiveness but could also

78
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,280
potentially

79
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,879
damage the plants that you're intending

80
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,878
on protecting
