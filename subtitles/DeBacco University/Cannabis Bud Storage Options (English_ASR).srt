1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,160
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,640
going to go over some canvas

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,000
bud storage options some do's and don'ts

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,199
so hopefully you can have

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,519
uh select a proper location for good

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
long-term storage of what you've put so

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
much effort into

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,960
[Music]

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,599
all right let's get into canvas bud

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,439
storage options here ones to consider

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,518
well first off what not to store

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,558
cannabis in a daily would be plastic is

13
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,238
not advised

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,839
plastic can be used for short-term

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,439
storage but here we're looking at

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,120
long-term storage and in this case

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,878
plastic would not be advised

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,159
either in the plastic baggie form or

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,759
even in the plastic

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,599
container typically not advised for the

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,878
longer term storage great for short term

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,280
or transfer no problem with that

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,000
also the fridge typically not an advised

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,920
location

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,679
the refrigerator and freezer there is

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
likely an automatic defroster

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,519
that can cause swings in humidity that

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
could result in potential for plant

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,120
damage

30
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,359
particularly if you don't have a

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,039
completely good seal on everything

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,640
i want to be mindful of that

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
refrigeration temperature is a good

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,439
thing but sometimes directly in the

35
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,280
refrigerator there's too much

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,919
fluctuation of those

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,519
temperatures that occurs now what is

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,439
advised i do recommend using

39
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,759
humidity packs and two-way humidity

40
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,359
packs these are the bodiva ones

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,640
that can be used to help maintain

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,438
consistent conditions now they're

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
two-way

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,879
which means that they can help raise or

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,719
lower humidity

46
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,798
to try to keep it within that range in

47
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,200
this case both of these would be keeping

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
it as close to 62 percent humidity as

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,519
possible

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
now this does not mean that if you have

51
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,798
wild swings and humidity that you're

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
going to be able to regulate

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,159
if you're already kind of close by

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,719
inserting one of these packs it'll help

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,040
it

56
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,078
maintain definitely within the desired

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
range and they come in different

58
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,279
humidities

59
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,679
62 for cannabis tends to be one of the

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
more common ones that's utilized

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
and your general storage conditions well

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
stable inert storage container

63
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
i will talk more about those on other

64
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,039
videos on this channel minimal light

65
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,599
particularly uv light

66
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
and temperatures of 4 degrees celsius or

67
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,919
lower

68
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,000
now if there's all these different

69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,479
specialty storage options as we can see

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,639
here

71
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
does not need to be some necessarily

72
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,958
some high-end

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
store here it can be kind of simple i'll

74
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
put in a

75
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,039
closed cupboard here as long as it's

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
stable conditions the

77
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,639
material it's made out of is inert

78
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,520
minimal light particularly uv light and

79
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,479
the temperatures

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,959
are relatively cool all good advice here

81
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,518
as far as keeping your cannabis buds

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
in nice long term duration storage

83
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
there'll be more detailed videos on this

84
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
channel you're welcome to search but

85
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
hopefully this gives you just general

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
an idea to consider and you can get more

87
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,359
into

88
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,360
specifics on other videos
