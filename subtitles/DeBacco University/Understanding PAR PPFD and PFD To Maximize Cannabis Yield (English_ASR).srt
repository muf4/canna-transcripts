1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,719
so on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,558
going over a foundational lecture here

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:10,638
understanding par ppfd and pfd

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,079
to maximize cannabis yield and if you're

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,919
not familiar with these terms

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,920
this is a great lecture to pay attention

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
to

8
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,359
[Music]

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,359
all right let's go over some of these

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
foundational terms regarding lighting

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,118
so you can better understand them and

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,358
apply them to different situations

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,799
so first off light intensities

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,079
importance what's the importance of

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,759
light intensity

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,679
well the levels of light intensity can

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,079
have significant effects on post

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,759
synthetic rates which directly relate to

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,439
a plant's ability to grow

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,878
measuring the light intensity involves a

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,640
few different options

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,718
so it's important to know the background

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,280
of each we're going to cover some of the

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,679
key ones here in this video lecture

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,960
when measuring keep the distance between

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,840
the meter and the light source

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
consistent

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,359
because the light intensity is follows

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,679
the inverse

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
inversely proportional to the square of

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,118
the distance

32
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,359
this is the inverse square law so what's

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,519
important to utilize or to remember

34
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,478
is that as you move that meter away from

35
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,079
light sources

36
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,920
it tells the inverse square law meaning

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,239
the distance is going to have a major

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,118
impact on the intensity that you're

39
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,239
going to measure

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,280
so you want to make sure you're keeping

41
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,199
that consistent because even a small

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,719
distance is going to cause a massive

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,719
change potentially

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,079
in the actual intensity of light because

45
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,400
it's a squared

46
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,920
distance is squared in that equation the

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
light energy at twice the distance

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,359
away is spread over four times the area

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
and that's why it's so important

50
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,359
to keep that distance consistent meaning

51
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
when you double the distance of light

52
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,759
it will decrease by 25 so we want to be

53
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,438
very mindful

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,879
to keep things consistent particularly

55
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,398
for measuring light or looking at

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,399
developing any sort of

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,079
comparisons to keep that distance

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,840
consistent

59
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,438
now when we're measuring light a lot of

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,719
times you'll see manufacturers

61
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,919
mention lumens and lumen is a standard

62
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,599
derived unit for luminous flux which is

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
weighted according to the model of a

64
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,879
human's eye sensitivity to various

65
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,639
wavelengths

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,079
essentially contains wavelengths humans

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,079
can easily see

68
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
there's no connection to the

69
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
photosynthetic process of plants

70
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
unlike a par reading which i'll talk

71
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
about here so the term that gets tossed

72
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,039
around is

73
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,719
lumens are for humans because this

74
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,878
it takes into account that the lumen is

75
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,080
a measurement of what we can see well

76
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,840
but if we're looking at artificial

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,000
lighting we want to know what the plant

78
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,319
can utilize that refers to par

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,919
so lumen readings really are not worth

80
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,679
all that much

81
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,199
we're talking about that par that i had

82
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,959
mentioned what is parts

83
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,958
stands for this photosynthetically

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,199
active radiation

85
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,719
now par um light so that's the light

86
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,159
when we're talking now moving away from

87
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,120
lumens now we're looking at kind of this

88
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,759
idea of

89
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,360
the importance of plants so this power

90
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,359
wave light is the wavelength of light

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
within the visible range of 400

92
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,599
to 700 nanometers which drive a

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,120
photosynthesis with photosynthetic

94
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:59,919
process and we see that kind of listed

95
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,640
right or shown

96
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,639
visually right here here's the par

97
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,598
reading and this is kind of capturing or

98
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,518
measuring

99
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,079
those wavelengths that fall in that

100
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,080
range note that chlorophyll

101
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
absorption is higher in the blue and red

102
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
portions of the light spectrum

103
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,199
so two light sources can have the same

104
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,318
par output but depending on the

105
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,719
wavelengths produced

106
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,079
can have different plant performances so

107
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,158
we're just measuring and this kind of

108
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
bowl here shows kind of the photons that

109
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,039
are captured

110
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,400
it could have a lot of red and very

111
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,840
little blue or it could have a lot of

112
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,879
blue and very little red and you might

113
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
get the same

114
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,560
par reading so just keep that in mind

115
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,518
that power readings

116
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
are taking no greater emphasis on one

117
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
wavelength or another it's just the kind

118
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,158
of the collection

119
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,158
of all the photons present within that

120
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,318
light source that was shown here is also

121
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:50,158
it's not measured as below 400 and

122
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:53,280
above 700 when we're measuring in par

123
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:56,079
now ppf which is the photosynthetic

124
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,080
photon flux provides the number of

125
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
photons in the 400 to 700 nanometer

126
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
wavelength range again

127
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
that drive photosynthesis which are

128
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,518
emitted by a light source

129
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,639
this is the same range as par the unit

130
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,200
for ppf

131
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,479
is the micro moles per second and this

132
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,798
is the quantity of

133
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,479
light particles emitted per second

134
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,600
simply put the ppf exam

135
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,839
is amount per time so we're looking here

136
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
however ppf does not consider the

137
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,879
direction in which the light is emitted

138
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,879
which means it does not

139
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,199
indicate the light that actually reaches

140
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,079
the leaves as we see in the example here

141
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
we see our light source

142
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,599
we see all the light being given off by

143
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
that light source

144
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
well if the plant is down below that

145
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
light source these kind of

146
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,959
areas here where the light is being kind

147
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,199
of reflected in upward direction

148
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,198
it is being produced but not necessarily

149
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,759
captured by the plant

150
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,840
so this leads us to the ppfd which is

151
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,240
the photosynthetic photon flux

152
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,079
density this provides the number of

153
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
photons again and that's 400 to 700

154
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,039
nanometer wavelength range that drive

155
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,639
the photosynthetic process

156
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,319
which are emitted by a light source in

157
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
the same range as the previous two

158
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,918
talked about this unit again is micro

159
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,120
moles

160
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,519
per meter squared per second so

161
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,879
this unit tells you how many photons

162
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,680
which drive

163
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,038
synthesis impact the area per second

164
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,759
simply pfd is the amount

165
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,360
per area also per time so this is kind

166
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
of giving you the idea of now we have

167
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
this little collection vesicle at the

168
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
bottom here

169
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,119
how many are actually being accumulated

170
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,720
per that area

171
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,639
over a set number of interval of time

172
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
so now we're using a reflector we're

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
trying to eliminate the loss we're

174
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,679
trying to capture

175
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,680
as many of those light wavelengths as

176
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,639
possible one of those photons as

177
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
possible

178
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
of different wavelengths now when we

179
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
compare par

180
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,800
to ppf and ppfd par is the

181
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
is a generic term still used in common

182
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
speech referred to as the energy flux or

183
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,600
photon flux

184
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,679
typically it's a unit is watts per meter

185
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
squared ppf is used

186
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,038
for the amount per time usually micro

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,399
moles per second

188
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,279
and ppfd is used for the amount per area

189
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,399
per time

190
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,519
micro moles per second per meter square

191
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,560
times second

192
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,599
ppfd helps define the intensity of light

193
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,360
over a given area so again instead of

194
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,479
just measuring those photons

195
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,160
produced by the light well now we're

196
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,120
looking at how many we're collecting

197
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
ideally hitting

198
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,959
the leaf surface however there's

199
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,360
limitations to these

200
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,839
in the sense that all of these are bound

201
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,038
by that same 400 to 700 nanometer

202
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,799
wavelengths of light

203
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,079
however in particular with cannabis

204
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
research where uv

205
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,318
and far red wavelengths are of interest

206
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,919
these above terms do not take into

207
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
account these wavelengths since they are

208
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,719
outside of that 400 700 nanometer

209
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
range so to take into account the

210
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,440
greater wavelengths there's pfd that's

211
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
taking now going beyond that limitations

212
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,279
before

213
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,479
of just 400 to 700 nanometers so

214
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,399
pfd or photon flux density

215
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,598
is a measure of the number of photons in

216
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,239
the 300

217
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,719
to 800 nanometer wavelengths passing

218
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
through

219
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,880
particular area per second so now we've

220
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,759
expanded that range

221
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,519
from all the way down to 300 all the way

222
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,759
up to 800 nanometers

223
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,959
the unit is micro moles per meter

224
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,680
squared per second

225
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,000
it's the amount per area per time

226
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
measuring that 300 to 800 nanometers so

227
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,439
this is not

228
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,319
limited to the 400 to 700 talked about

229
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,519
previously

230
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,598
those photosynthetic wavelengths

231
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,680
they take into account far red and also

232
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,120
ultraviolet radiation so this can be

233
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
very important particularly

234
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,560
when we're talking about cannabis

235
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,879
production which is why this pfd

236
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
is considered kind of the unit to start

237
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,560
to take a look at

238
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,840
now as i mentioned units are important

239
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,240
so always check the units used

240
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,279
in any work you're reading micro moles

241
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,120
per meter

242
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,878
squared per second is key and what ppfd

243
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,478
is measured in and you see here

244
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,160
different units have different um

245
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,639
can we can have numbers associated with

246
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,120
that so i only weigh 58 well in what

247
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,560
units

248
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
standard chicken masses you know if

249
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,038
you're making up units or not following

250
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,720
certain units

251
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,079
it will allow you to do better

252
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
comparisons

253
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,439
or at least make a potential for

254
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,000
comparison if you keep track of the

255
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,918
units

256
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,759
that a particular manufacturer might be

257
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,680
posting or what a particular scientific

258
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,120
study might be showing

259
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
so when we're looking at how do we get

260
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
those numbers well light sensors are the

261
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
primary instrument

262
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
used to quantify the light intensities

263
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,598
of horticultural lighting systems

264
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,120
these sensors work by using an optical

265
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,360
filter to create a uniform

266
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,399
sensitivity to par light growers will

267
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
use this style

268
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,399
for a point in time measurement but some

269
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,919
options to connect these to data loggers

270
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,639
can allow for an accumulation of

271
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,639
readings

272
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,240
for different day-to-day comparisons

273
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,080
which can be quite useful

274
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,759
it's just an example here of one of the

275
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,278
meters you can kind of use them to get

276
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,200
an idea of the density of light

277
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,600
just as a point in time but also link it

278
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,800
here and get an overtime

279
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,000
so when we're measuring that ppfd now

280
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,479
apogee the mq620 extended range pfd

281
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,278
sensor

282
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,159
allows for uv and far red photons to be

283
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,838
measured

284
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,919
research has shown the value of adding

285
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
uv in far red in particular with canvas

286
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,319
production

287
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,239
while this meter now can start to

288
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
measure some of that range

289
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
the 1040 nanometer top cutoff also means

290
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,639
that the sensor will measure thermal

291
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
outputs of hps fixtures and other broad

292
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,919
spectrum lights

293
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
so the sensor is intended for use only

294
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,639
in led environments

295
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
what does that just generally mean well

296
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,958
when we get to these higher nanometer

297
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,119
kind of

298
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,518
wavelengths we could also be getting

299
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,360
into kind of the thermal output

300
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,039
of certain lighting which might cause

301
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,399
readings to be artificially high

302
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,000
which is why these are typically used

303
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
more in led environments where you're

304
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
not getting quite those high thermal

305
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,240
outputs

306
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,759
as you would with a hps or high pressure

307
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,839
sodium light

308
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,919
so how can this help to maximize

309
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,240
cannabis yield kind of putting this

310
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,519
together here well since canvas is a

311
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
high light

312
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
tolerant plant there are more potential

313
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,799
options when it comes to lighting

314
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,000
unlike a lettuce crop that needs lower

315
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,240
intensities canvas is a high

316
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
intense light plant with the

317
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,278
ever-changing artificial lighting market

318
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
understanding these terms can help

319
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,559
growers make informed decisions which is

320
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,120
kind of the whole point of this entire

321
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,479
channel

322
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,639
to allow you to get to gain some

323
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,399
information also with cannabis the

324
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,159
secondary compounds are also important

325
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,919
for branding plants with wavelengths

326
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,559
outside of the typical par

327
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,479
or ppfd spectrum may be advantageous

328
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,399
when it comes to maximizing yield

329
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
at least knowing what is being produced

330
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
within that wavelength range

331
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
might help make better informed

332
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,959
decisions when you're starting to make

333
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,720
adjustments

334
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,039
now with all of this research and all

335
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,920
this information a couple people here

336
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,559
uh to thank uh in the sense that

337
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,078
compiled some information some research

338
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,838
these are great people to kind of go

339
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,120
through and take a look at as far as

340
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
some other research that they may have

341
