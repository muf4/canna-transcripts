1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,679
going to go over some caterpillar

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,599
identification and control

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,439
as well as at the end show you two

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:16,910
different species of caterpillars

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:20,000
feeding on cannabis plants

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,278
[Music]

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
all right let's get into caterpillar

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,839
identification and control on cannabis

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,320
well first off there's many different

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,480
types of caterpillars sadly all that in

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,558
some way negatively impact cannabis

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,558
these would be the issue covered here

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,679
but realize there's are even more

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,479
than these just in the list provided

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,519
so first off painted lady identification

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,439
so they're typically

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
two to five leaves may be webbed

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,519
together you might kind of see this kind

20
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,878
of like

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,280
like cocoon like structure and and this

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,919
is kind of this ragged chewing injuries

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
will also

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,198
be evident in that particular area the

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,439
caterpillars

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,479
within the webbed leaf kind of shelter

27
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,960
there are notably

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,000
spiny and early stage larvae are pale

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
brown

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
as they age they become variable marked

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
with black and yellow

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,840
with considerable range in the overall

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
coloration you can also see kind of the

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,600
what the butterfly looks like

35
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,200
as well as that kind of spiny look here

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,839
to the actual caterpillars it's

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
important to

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,200
identify this as well as others at all

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,118
stages of their life cycle

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
we also have the salt marsh caterpillar

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,640
identification and this is

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,079
damage to hemp by salt marsh caterpillar

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
is likely to be minimal

44
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,239
peak feeding occurs late in the season

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
and is limited mainly to the foliage

46
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,280
so here we see some saltwatch

47
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,199
caterpillars shown

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
some of the range in colorations so it

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,719
is a little bit more variable it's not

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
just kind of like one standard look

51
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,798
um so just be aware of that when we're

52
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,560
looking at identifying the caterpillar

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
you might be finding on your cannabis

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,280
plant we also have the yelly

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
yellow woolly bearer for identification

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,239
and does have a yellow coloration it

57
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,798
does look very woolly

58
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,798
damaged by hemp is likely also thought

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
to be minimal uh by this

60
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
caterpillar peak feeding occurs also

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
late in the season

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,200
and season and is limited to basically

63
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,719
the foliage

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,159
so keep in mind that just because you

65
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,520
find a caterpillar on your plant doesn't

66
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,959
mean they're doomed

67
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,719
some of this feeding occurs late in the

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,598
season some of it might be minimal but

69
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,719
still worth

70
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,079
a proper identification the zebra

71
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,318
caterpillar identification

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
here in hemp damage limited smallmouth

73
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,479
foliage scattered throughout the

74
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,159
planting

75
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,679
damage to hemp by the zebra caterpillar

76
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,239
can be expected to be minimal

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
and insignificant to crop yield kind of

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
a distinctive one

79
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
both in the caterpillar stage a little

80
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,000
bit

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,599
less so in the actual adult stage there

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,280
now more brown a little even more able

83
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,518
to blend in here

84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
kind of that neat bright yellow stripes

85
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,080
those very distinctive

86
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,598
black lines on white background then we

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
have the variegated cutworm

88
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,639
and this appears to primarily feed on

89
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,319
hemp leaves

90
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,399
however it is known to tunnel into

91
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,919
developing flowers and fruit of other

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
crops so be sure to inspect

93
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,439
developing buds it is known to be a kind

94
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,319
of tunneler

95
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,598
so it happens on other species why not

96
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,878
and hemp you know it's typically found

97
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,598
on the outer portion

98
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,199
it has the ability to tunnel uh so just

99
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,639
be mindful of that

100
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,560
then we have the managing of the

101
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,000
caterpillars so calpers are

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,158
most effectively controlled and they're

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,199
small most pesticides will have little

104
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,280
to no effect on bigger caterpillars

105
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,919
most are based on bt as the active

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
ingredient bacillus thyroid genesis

107
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,359
chemical control should be used as a

108
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
last resort as proper fertility

109
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,239
irrigation sanitation should all prior

110
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,080
be prioritized over pesticides there's

111
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,878
also on some of the larger ones in small

112
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
applications

113
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,039
could be hand removed now let's get into

114
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,878
actually seeing some of these

115
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,120
caterpillar sadly in action

116
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:49,518
feeding on cannabis plants enjoy

117
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,680
all right in this video we see an army

118
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
worm eating a cannabis plant

119
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
now the audio is not necessarily true to

120
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,000
the actual what's going on but we can

121
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,798
see in real time

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,959
just how aggressive one of these

123
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
caterpillars can basically be

124
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,640
these worms are how quick they can eat

125
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,158
and devour a plant

126
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,238
uh you can see here really close to the

127
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,399
bud so that's of course of concern

128
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,000
and usually where there's one well none

129
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,519
pictured in the image here

130
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,439
i'm sure there's a few more and this

131
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
implements more scouting as well as

132
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,199
control

133
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,440
in addition to army worms we also have

134
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,560
another caterpillar pest here

135
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,439
this is a winter moth of feeding on a

136
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,199
cannabis plant

137
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,199
located in a high tunnel
