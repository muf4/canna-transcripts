1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:06,599
okay this is gonna be a very quick

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,880
overview of eukaryotic cells looking

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,119
here's an example of just a model one

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,440
this is an animal cell and looking at

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:15,508
some of the components and what

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,300
basically allows you to look at this and

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,100
define it as a eukaryotic cell we're not

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,939
going to go over any of the individual

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,550
organelles

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,350
that'll be saved for another video so

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,359
first off you care excels the domain

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,890
Eukarya what's it include if you looked

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,960
at my video on ProCare as soon as we

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,820
talked about archaea and bacteria here

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,230
looking at basically the rest the

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,159
protists the fungi the plants and the

17
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,819
animals here

18
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,919
these are eukaryotic cells so what's

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,488
eukaryotic cell well they contain memory

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,429
bound nucleus if specialized organelles

21
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:50,128
a plasma membrane and are actually in

22
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,409
comparison much larger than prokaryotic

23
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,089
cells some cells example plant cells

24
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,519
have a cell wall not switch this is

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,649
indicating here so the key part here is

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,000
these memory bound organelles and it's

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,948
what makes them distinctly different

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,728
than our very simple more primitive

29
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:08,548
prokaryotic cells these organelles for

30
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,739
example are basically little

31
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,650
compartments and they perform very

32
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,269
specific functions the isolate reactions

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,820
from one another so it allows them to be

34
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,840
membrane down this is a nice

35
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:23,399
representative cell there's 14

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,460
organelles basically identified in this

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,960
other videos we'll go through these but

38
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,359
if you're able to kind of recognize some

39
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,699
of these I quit number nine is clearly

40
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,719
the mitochondria notice the folds in

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,340
their e1 and to write nucleus is the

42
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,828
larger structure nucleolus is the

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,430
smaller structure in there and so on and

44
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:46,529
so forth so again being able to see the

45
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,570
fact that this cell has organelles puts

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,099
it in the category of eukaryote and in

47
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,309
understanding what all of these do we'll

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:56,609
be safe for another video two classes of

49
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,960
organelles our endomembrane system these

50
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,179
are organelles that communicate with one

51
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,949
another via channels these are

52
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,100
completely endoplasmic reticulum the

53
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,689
Golgi apparatus and there's the other

54
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,848
type of organelles the energy week

55
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:10,439
related organelles the might occur in

56
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,269
the chloroplasts these are both

57
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,409
independent and self-sufficient they

58
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,630
kind of generate their own

59
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:18,509
energy no slot folds in both of these

60
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:21,150
high surface area to volume ratio on the

61
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,859
mitochondria present in all cells and

62
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,140
remember our chloroplasts only present

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,730
in plant cells because they go through

64
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,769
the process of closed synthesis a nice

65
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,869
comparison between prokaryotes and

66
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,270
eukaryotes cells good way to kind of go

67
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,860
down the list and see if you can be able

68
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,450
to recognize or identify certain

69
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,310
characteristics of one which is the

70
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:44,609
other being able to compare and contrast

71
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,890
in two makes for an excellent quiz or

72
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,870
test question so going through and

73
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,189
looking at the type of nucleus remember

74
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,680
you carrots have that true nucleus and

75
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:54,750
double membrane proteins just have a

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,270
nuclear region they look really true

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,210
define nucleus dealing a circular and

78
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,310
prokaryotes linear and eukaryotes and so

79
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,710
on and so forth so you look again pause

80
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,629
the video and compare the two and look

81
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,760
back at the pro Kerik video if you'd

82
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,930
like to review that one and be able to

83
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,209
compare both of these different types

84
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,290
because you're probably gonna see it

85
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,290
somewhere in the future
