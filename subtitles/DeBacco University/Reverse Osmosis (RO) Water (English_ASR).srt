1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
so here I'm gonna talk about reverse

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:07,349
osmosis water are often referred to as

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,300
simply RO water so if I go into kind of

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,399
reverse osmosis kind of interesting what

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,679
as Moses is and what how that operates

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,150
in a general sense this kind of works

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,850
its way backwards with filters and

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,289
membranes so first off before we talk

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,510
about eating osmosis let's talk about

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,769
diffusion diffusion is the movement of

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,050
molecules from an area of high

12
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,089
concentration to an area of low

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,670
concentration so where do we see that

14
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,768
will we see the drop of food dye

15
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,289
diffusing out in the container here area

16
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,119
of high concentration really spreading

17
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,159
out to an area of low concentration over

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,988
time now as this occurred we'll simply

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,029
the natural movement of the molecules

20
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,609
here will eventually kind of stir this

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,670
up and allow it to become homogenized

22
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,280
here so as Moses is the movement of

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,170
water through a semipermeable membrane

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,179
from less concentrated solution to more

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,250
concentrated solution so what's the semi

26
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,988
permeable membrane referred to here it's

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,939
a membrane or only some things can pass

28
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,769
through see the large red molecules

29
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,479
can't pass through here with the smaller

30
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,159
purple green and yellow ones can it's

31
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,769
semi permeable some things can pass

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,930
through we see the evidence here moving

33
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,149
from less concentrated solution to more

34
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,740
concentrated so here we have a less

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,420
concentrated solution here's our semi

36
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,269
permeable membrane the water's going to

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,490
move across we see that here where that

38
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,978
water level has now increased on this

39
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,929
side and decreased on this side a delta

40
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,049
change in a change in height and we'll

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,430
notice at the end the concentration of

42
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,320
dissolved salts on the left and right

43
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,549
side is the same here we could see

44
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,889
there's much more water than there are

45
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,130
the dissolved salts because water moved

46
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,710
across here we now have an even spread

47
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,509
between these two the states between the

48
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,640
semi permeable membrane in this case the

49
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,430
dissolved salts cannot move across that

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,460
so this is osmosis as it naturally

51
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,200
occurs we talk about reverse osmosis now

52
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,059
there's an apparatus used to separate

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,430
the dissolved solids from water but

54
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,659
utilizing a semipermeable membrane so

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,909
many of the same terms we just talked

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,890
about the separation of dissolve solids

57
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,200
from water is what's occurring and this

58
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,909
forces pure water through a membrane

59
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,590
with the goals to produce as close to

60
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,929
pure water as possible with an

61
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,610
electrical conductivity and EC of zero

62
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,610
or as close to zero as possible

63
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,158
often to reduce cec water by nearing

64
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:21,729
zero by removing the minerals is the

65
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:23,318
reason why reverse osmosis is used it's

66
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:25,539
used quite frequently especially for

67
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:27,968
hydroponic production as a result that

68
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,949
filters out my filters are utilized to

69
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,509
separate out and clean water from

70
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,738
wastewater so it'll be kind of this

71
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:34,658
constant flow through I see a lot of

72
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,849
tubing's here there's a wastewater

73
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:39,878
there's a there's a clean water and

74
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:41,888
there's a end result or as Moses reverse

75
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,739
osmosis and water and that's the water

76
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:46,750
you're gonna want to use so what it does

77
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,180
is what or what it can do is it can turn

78
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,500
salt water into freshwater but there are

79
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,079
filters or membranes that need to be

80
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,299
changed so we can see here natural

81
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,790
osmosis we want to take these where

82
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,230
these few mean salt particles are moving

83
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:01,568
across this area program to this side

84
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:03,818
what the reverse osmosis it's working in

85
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:06,759
the opposite way it's taking water and

86
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,259
forcing it across this membrane where it

87
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,638
doesn't want to go and there will be a

88
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,590
couple molecules that will sneak through

89
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,169
but for the most part this will be very

90
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,819
close to pure water through these

91
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,379
membranes and these need to be changed

92
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:20,259
over time because they can clog based on

93
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:21,728
the water you're trying to purify you

94
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,078
also want to keep the system clean to

95
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:24,639
help reduce the chance of microbes

96
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,859
developing in the system they can

97
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,599
develop sometimes on these membranes and

98
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,669
they need to do the new to be changed

99
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,929
regularly anyway but it's just a good

100
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,150
idea to just make sure you're not

101
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,310
allowing algae growth on them putting on

102
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,389
a sunny location just take extra

103
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,280
measures to keep them as clean as

104
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:43,090
possible so the last as long as possible

105
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,930
so you can produce quality RO water for

106
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,930
your grow operation
