1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
going to break down a scientific article

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:11,080
that looks at plant structure effects on

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,080
chemical uniformity in cannabis plants

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,759
[Music]

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
all right let's take a look and see how

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,359
plant structure affects chemical

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
uniformity in cannabis

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,880
so first off this is the research

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,039
article um here if you want to look at

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,439
it in more detail i'd recommend you do

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
because they do get into some great

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,439
specifics of their pruning methods you

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,280
might want to read this article

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,718
once you find the pruning method you

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,239
think you want to investigate further

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,920
you might want to go back here to this

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,558
original source

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,800
so first off plant morphology and bud

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,640
location so plants shoot growth pattern

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,718
and shape is commonly manipulated by

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,878
growers worldwide by numerous techniques

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
including planting densities trestling

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,960
plant hormones and by the physical

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,960
removal of plant organs and that's

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,640
according to the researchers there in

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
addition to the physical location of the

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,799
inflorescence on the plants in relation

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,719
to the light source it was also

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,879
investigated in this study it was we'll

31
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,359
see both these factors contribute to the

32
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,560
quality of the total harvest so we want

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,478
to keep in mind that not only the

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,439
structure of the plant but in relation

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,920
to those buds into the intensity of the

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,279
light can also impact their overall

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,359
quality

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,879
so here's the description of some of

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,239
their pruning methods and they go

40
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,399
through them and they're kind of they're

41
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,399
pretty they're quite extensive uh here

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,840
which is great they have a control which

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,880
is great and a defoliation this bb

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,960
lr is bottom branches and leaves removed

45
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,599
commonly referred to as lollipopping so

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,839
where you see what they said vblr you

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,438
can think of that as lollipopping then

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
they went through and they have primary

49
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,039
branch removal secondary branch removal

50
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,798
single prune and double prune i kind of

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,960
highlight the double prune here and

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,600
that's pruning the plants twice at the

53
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,599
duration of the single prune and a

54
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,158
second time at the transition to the

55
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,959
short day or flowering treatments this

56
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,320
just a reminder uh in this trial

57
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,319
they stated that this experiment was

58
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,078
conducted in a randomized

59
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,079
random experimental design with six

60
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,079
replicates replicated groups for each

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,879
treatment was arranged in three rows out

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,200
of which a plant from the center row was

63
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,759
then sampled here so this gives you an

64
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,519
idea of their general structure based on

65
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,719
the different plant architecture

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
manipulation treatments that they

67
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,479
mentioned here

68
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,238
so let's kind of look at the data now so

69
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,000
we kind of learned all the backgrounds

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
there well now let's get into the actual

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
data component of the architecture

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,598
related to the cannabinoid yield the

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
results revealed that pruning the plants

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,919
twice during cultivation was the optimum

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,759
practice for increasing yield and other

76
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,919
treatments decreased or did not affect

77
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,679
yield quality so i know there's a lot of

78
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,280
numbers here but we're looking at the

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
different architecture manipulation

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,878

84
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,679
there's a lot of numbers here but what

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
we're noticing is i highlighted it here

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,400
with a little kind of green outline box

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,959
here

88
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,280
is that the double prune method for all

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,239
of the treatments here had the highest

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,039
rate of return in grams per plant of the

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
various cannabinoids provided here and

92
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,679
there is some variability we are talking

93
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,598
about plants we are talking about kind

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
of a living organism here

95
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,798
some had very close similarities to a

96
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,878
a being the highest number and then

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,560
subsequent letters indicating

98
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,959
significant differences from a

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
statistical ten standpoint using a two

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,199
keys hd test

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,959
being different from from the comparison

102
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,199
there so again the kind of take home

103
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
message here we can definitely see

104
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,679
the double prune method improved all of

105
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
these particular cannabinoids there so

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
that's where you can go back to the

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,158
original article look some more of the

108
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
description of the details of that

109
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,158
particular pruning method

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
now they also mentioned or looked at

111
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,199
influence

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,039
sampling locations so influences or

113
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,280
blood sampling locations one through

114
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,639
five kind of shown here on the plant and

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,318
this is an image of a control plant

116
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,839
which basically didn't have pruning just

117
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,518
to give you an idea of where that

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
sampling may have occurred

119
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,799
trimmed influences was dried at 24

120
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,519
degrees celsius and 55 air humidity for

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,200
14 days in an environmentally controlled

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720
chamber in the dark so it gives you an

123
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,159
idea of their kind of drying and curing

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,919
process

125
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
now light penetration

126
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,439
so therefore the architecture of

127
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,519
manipulated plants can be utilized to

128
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,519
increase yield biomass and

129
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,918
standardization but the cannabinoid

130
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,758
yield should be addressed by other means

131
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,399
a considerable reduction of light

132
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,160
inception down the chute was observed

133
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,918
and the extent of spatial

134
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,080
standardization of the cannabinoid

135
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,918
profile correlated with the effect of

136
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,240
plant architecture and light penetration

137
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,680
to the lower parts of the canopy so what

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,519
does that mean let's give a summary of

139
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,519
that basically

140
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,039
as we see here just an under plant shot

141
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,799
not from the study but just a random

142
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
plant with lights above it the

143
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,439
penetration of that light diminishes

144
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,799
quite quite substantially so as you get

145
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,600
deeper into that canopy the light

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,759
penetration becomes less and less and

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,840
less and this suggests that low light

148
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
availability at the bottom of the plant

149
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,478
or in deeply shaded regions of the plant

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,800
is a powerful inducer for reduction of

151
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,719
those chemical standardizations

152
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
meaning those buds that are in the shade

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
that are further away from the lights

154
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
are simply going to yield less

155
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,560
cannabinoids so having good plant

156
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,319
structure but also exposing those buds

157
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
in some way to the greatest amount of

158
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,038
intensity of light coming down in this

159
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,918
case

160
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,599
was advantageous to increase those uh

161
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,519
cannabinoid profiles there and

162
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
standardizations

163
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,038
so the light and buds so how does this

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,720
kind of right relate to

165
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,240
many growers in support of the screen of

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
green method highlight the idea that

167
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
maximizing light exposure will improve

168
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,079
bud quality which this study kind of

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
confirms there and this is support of

170
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,519
this screen of green method where all

171
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
those buds are kind of grown on the same

172
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
uh platform there the same plane all

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,080
pointing up all getting the maximum

174
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,399
amount of light however though

175
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,159
keep in mind that the added labor in

176
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,638
time to properly perform this screen of

177
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,840
green method so when an operation is

178
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
looking to maximize plant growth and

179
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,719
efficiency the screen of green may not

180
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,439
be the most advantageous of pruning

181
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,800
methods but for those that may be with

182
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,120
plant restriction numbers can only grow

183
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,560
so many plants and really it's not the

184
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
grower doesn't have the main focus on

185
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,639
efficiency and quick turnover times this

186
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,439
is why the screen of green method is

187
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,199
probably so popular with many growers

188
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,918
because it is a way to kind of produce

189
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,600
more of those top quality a buds from a

190
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,120
single plant

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,919
so lastly optimizing that plant

192
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,918
structure so the double prune method um

193
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,758
as stated in this article

194
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,519
is that allows for maximum light

195
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
exposure to as many buds as possible

196
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,159
it's proven to be advantageous and this

197
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,918
gives the idea that slightly smaller but

198
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,080
well structured plants

199
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,478
can be top quality producers so you

200
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,879
don't necessarily need some giant plant

201
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,758
to have high quality high yielding

202
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,079
production smaller more manicured better

203
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,080
trimmed better pruned better allocation

204
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,519
of light to buds ratios can be

205
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,959
advantageous now we don't want to

206
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,799
necessarily go too small make it you

207
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,239
know a little bonsai plant

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
but look at this study i think it

209
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,519
presents some good information that some

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,079
growers may have known but kind of gives

211
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,000
you some scientific background and may

212
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,800
maybe you find a new pruning method that

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
can help increase your yields uh without

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,079
really having to change that much since

215
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
i do still understand your strain or

216
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,680
cultivar does this pruning method or

217
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,120
that architecture change

218
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,639
you could see an improvement in your

219
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
yields best of luck
