1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
okay here we're looking at population

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:08,549
growth models that can be applied to the

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,190
world's population estimating different

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,460
growth scenarios is being low medium or

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:17,489
high or we can in this case mushrooms or

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,300
plants or just about anything we as a

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:22,979
population we can apply growth models to

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,730
so we're gonna start here by applying it

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,099
to an example of yellow perch which is a

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,368
freshwater fish question is how many

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,899
more deaths occurred in 2001 then burst

12
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,988
based on this data compared to the year

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,969
2000 this is the equation revenues this

14
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:42,509
Delta or change in an archangel

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,480
population size over the change in time

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,890
equals the birth rate minus the death

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,589
rate we're gonna use this data right

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,649
here so quality of analysis is located

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,390
higher intervals year 2000 and 2001 in

20
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,109
the year 2000 the population of perch

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,840
was 16,000 and the population declined

22
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:06,290
to 12,000 in the year 2001 therefore

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,180
4,000 more deaths occurred than births

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,240
no make a note of this it's not as

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,890
simple as 4,000 perch died remember that

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,500
burst didn't cease we're looking at the

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,868
difference between our birth rate and

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,030
our death rate look at the quantitative

29
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,969
analysis putting it into the equation

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,540
here we have that 4,000 more deaths than

31
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:30,150
births occurred from the year 2000 to

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:33,030
2001 so while birth still occurred there

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,650
were so yellow perch being born the

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,409
difference between those that diagnose

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,170
that were born was 4000 more deaths that

36
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,790
occurred now there's different types of

37
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,228
curves that want you just to be in

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,509
general familiar with we have an

39
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,328
exponential one where it's is continue

40
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,250
to increase at a very rapid rate it's

41
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,438
not linear its exponential it's much

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,019
quicker in a logistic curve here where

43
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,429
we see a rapid increase and then a level

44
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,718
and offer a plateau and that occurs

45
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,549
looking here at a exponential growth

46
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,728
curves this is the growth rate of e.coli

47
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,310
if we applied the same kind of idea the

48
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:12,810
change in population size over time

49
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:16,239
equals the maximum of per capita growth

50
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,650
rate of the population one of the most

51
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,049
common examples of exponential growth

52
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,110
years bacteria because they can multiply

53
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:26,140
at a very fast rate each bacteria can

54
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,080
split into two cells in Dublin this male

55
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:30,279
this may only take 18 22 minutes for

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,650
this to occur depending on the

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,449
conditions for example if we only start

58
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,569
with one bacteria which doubles every

59
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:39,068
hour since it reproduces asexually by

60
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:39,909
the end of the day there's looking at a

61
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:42,759
day count

62
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,909
we start with one bacteria doubling in

63
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,280
this case every hour by the end of the

64
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:51,068
day we would have over 16 million

65
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,640
bacteria if it follow this exponential

66
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:55,899
growth curve that's exponential growth

67
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,238
as soon as the population is growing

68
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,310
without limits at its maximum rate I

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,019
don't see that here however there are

70
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,329
environmental limits no matter what

71
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,159
system we're talking about so while we

72
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:07,780
do have an exponential phase here

73
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,409
theoretically that would continue on

74
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,659
forever

75
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,239
however there this doesn't happen

76
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:14,859
because of environmental limits yeah

77
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,719
this is plateauing and you can even have

78
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:19,209
reverse occur where we in the death

79
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,280
phase that occurs the logistic growth

80
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,560
model here is no matter how fast

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,539
populations grow they eventually reach a

82
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,000
limit and that's kind of an inherited

83
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:30,009
plateauing this is imposed by shortage

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,539
of important Bayern mental factors it

85
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,969
could be nutrients it be water through

86
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,888
space it could be light any combination

87
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:37,568
of these depending what organisms and

88
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,030
what you graphic region we're talking

89
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:42,578
about those are something called

90
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,680
carrying capacity so the character path

91
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,019
is a maximum number of individuals and

92
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,389
earing can support and symbolized by the

93
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,450
letter okay so here we have time and

94
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,489
population size early growth is rapid

95
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,378
it's almost exponential here growth

96
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,919
begins to slow there's kind of a point

97
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:01,030
here and let growth Falls to zero that

98
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,340
doesn't mean that there's zero

99
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,930
individuals the growth rate will fall to

100
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,389
zero the growth rate reach that carrying

101
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,150
capacity that kind of maximum number of

102
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,639
individuals that a particular region can

103
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,889
support so a is showing an exponential

104
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,319
curve which really does not occur in

105
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,939
nature we have this more logistic curve

106
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,339
we have exponential for a short period

107
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:23,319
of time and a leveling off those

108
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,209
organisms approach we call or termed

109
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,550
their carrying capacity

110
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:29,258
as a population approaches its carrying

111
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,060
capacity the growth rate slows because

112
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,759
of women factors logistic growth

113
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,829
equation accounts for this graphical

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,770
plot of n which is known individuals

115
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:40,448
versus T time gives an s-shaped super

116
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,859
model growth curve you see that here

117
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:43,870
start with individuals we have

118
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,490
exponential phase with a stationary

119
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,470
phase with things level off in this

120
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,620
example because of a death phase that

121
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,970
falls back down over time showing a nice

122
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,240
image of comparing the two of

123
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,949
exponential a versus logistic growth

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,930
exponential assumes unlimited resources

125
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,960
for populations exhibit exponential

126
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,610
growth villainous G shaped curve or

127
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,560
wristed more realistically we have this

128
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,348
logistic growth model which has a

129
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,598
carrying capacity populations exhibit

130
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:12,668
logistic growth where expansion

131
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:14,860
decreases as resources become more

132
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:16,959
scarce and levels off when the carrying

133
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,598
capacity of environment is reached

134
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,799
resulting in this s-shaped curve and

135
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,810
this is one that's more true for

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,699
biological systems so again we're using

137
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,519
this model here for what's the carrying

138
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:30,430
capacity of this piece you see this only

139
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,948
takes hours it goes very quickly you

140
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,150
manatees that carrying capacity so

141
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,310
should be at a look at a graph and

142
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:38,918
determine a carrying capacity and also

143
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,319
the time it takes to reach K for that

144
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:44,589
carrying capacity so looking at are you

145
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,649
specifically it takes about what's the

146
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:49,329
carrying capacity is about 13

147
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:52,839
individuals you could say for this given

148
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:54,819
environment takes approximately 30 hours

149
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,859
for this to occur over all this one's

150
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,620
pretty easy it's one a little bit more

151
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,389
complicated so the Paramecium here

152
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,098
what's the carrying capacity and how

153
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,019
long does it take to reach that well

154
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:06,339
some populations fluctuate greatly to

155
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,709
make it difficult to define that

156
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:10,119
carrying capacity some overshoot in an

157
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,698
undershoot so we're kind of looking at

158
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,629
where does that level and off occur so

159
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,639
take a look what's the carrying capacity

160
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:18,490
in this population and how long has it

161
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,728
taken to reach that well a simple answer

162
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:24,069
is if you're invested about 130 s and C

163
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,810
here it takes approximately about a

164
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,569
hundred days for it to kind of level off

165
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,610
and reach that determination

166
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,978
so hopefully this is helpful and

167
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,338
