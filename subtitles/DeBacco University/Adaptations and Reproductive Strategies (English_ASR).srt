1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,318
okay here we're gonna look at

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,290
adaptations and reproductive strategies

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,269
here so starting with a life history of

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,759
adaptations in general well life history

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,219
is a complete lifecycle of an animal you

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,660
were looking at the salmon life

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,189
histories are diverse with many

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,740
different organisms having different

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,960
adaptations to their environments chosen

10
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:25,198
salmon here is they choose to run up to

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,118
freshwater streams of - they were born I

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,300
can see that they end up spawning in

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,549
extremely shallow water concerns is a

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,130
fish that spends most of its life out in

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,468
the open ocean I just run up to these

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,770
extremely shallow gravelly kind of beds

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,590
to spawn that's an example of a life

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,289
history adaptation to get away from some

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,379
predators here it gives its fry or its

20
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,480
small babies here a chance at survival

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,420
before entering and spending most of

22
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,549
their lives in the ocean now life

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,559
history adaptations there's two main key

24
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,479
ones that we want to focus on there's

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,578
something collared are selected and the

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,109
next one's going to be K selected so

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,420
it's been a moment here on our selected

28
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,250
adaptations these are selected

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,680
adaptations or populations that favor

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,590
exponential growth model they have a

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,229
very high rate of increase and they're

32
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,909
followed by a rapid rate of decrease so

33
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,650
it's kind of like the boom-bust model

34
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,960
here of adaptations where they have a

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,270
rapid rate of increase they have a rapid

36
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,589
rate of decrease our selective

37
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,390
reproductive strategies are more

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,219
opportunistic they have a short

39
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,920
maturation period and also a short

40
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,469
lifespan example here B the mosquito

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,409
there's many small offspring and usually

42
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,509
one early reproductive cycle they have

43
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,100
no parental care and a very high death

44
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,290
rate so you can see that here with

45
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:46,039
ladybugs mosquitoes would be examples

46
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,990
since the rabbits can improve it

47
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,909
multiplied they're very rapid rate in

48
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,578
the hail massive decrease in populations

49
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,280
in days to more evident here with our

50
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,798
mosquitoes and insects here where we

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,079
have a very short life span no parental

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,420
care and sadly a very high death rate

53
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,758
now in contrast to that either they are

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,840
selected so in contrast to are selected

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
there's something called

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,479
K selected adaptations these are

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,270
populations that experience competitive

58
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,789
logistic curve

59
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,830
of growth in the favor of reproduction

60
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:20,530
near the carrying capacity it's our

61
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,450
general adaptations case selected

62
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,060
individuals have a long maturation in

63
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:27,819
lifespan the example would be elephants

64
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,699
here are bears and whales they have few

65
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,579
but large offspring usually several late

66
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:36,250
reproductive cycles did extensive

67
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:40,030
parental care and as a result of that a

68
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:43,469
very low death rate so keep in mind idea

69
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,360
to compare case selected adaptations to

70
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,219
the unconscious that they are selected

71
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,560
ones and what animals may fall in this

72
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,060
and why that's a tenth ages for them and

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,800
kind of so that what animals may fall on

74
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,490
ok selected and why it's advantageous

75
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,130
for those individuals looking in general

76
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,750
here at parental care strategies most

77
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,060
natural populations exhibit a

78
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,629
combination of the arcade adaptations or

79
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,490
get to extreme examples here so base my

80
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,859
level kind of more are selected and more

81
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,310
K selected we're look at the kind of the

82
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,520
species of barnacles and wasters for

83
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:21,219
example they can produce about 500

84
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,780
million fertilized eggs per year name

85
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,270
this energy into producing this many

86
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,580
offspring as possible but as a result

87
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,400
they provide no parental care and as

88
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,090
results have very small portions of that

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,920
15 million year actually survive species

90
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,110
such as gorillas they only give birth

91
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,359
approximately once every five years

92
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,250
however they miss a significant amount

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,890
of time and energy into ensuring the

94
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,319
survival of their offspring so in this

95
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,899
case the gorillas and chimpanzees they

96
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:54,039
choose to have less offspring but put

97
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:57,460
more energy into care boys and barnacles

98
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,979
put no energy into care and they just

99
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,140
put all the energy into odds of

100
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:04,539
producing as many individuals as

101
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,949
possible you can see here the Frog and

102
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:09,129
the rabbits are kind of more in the

103
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,659
middle here chimpanzees and gorillas we

104
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,759
have one extreme and oysters and

105
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:15,069
barnacles being the other when it comes

106
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,858
to parental care strategies and both of

107
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,379
these are able to succeed in the global

108
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:24,810
environment but you could see that their

109
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:24,810
strategies are very different
