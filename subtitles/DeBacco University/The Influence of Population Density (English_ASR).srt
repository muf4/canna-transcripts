1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay here when I take a brief overview

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,919
of the influence of population density

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:10,679
the example image here would see a very

4
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:14,039
densely packed population or population

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,599
of high density so we have two main ways

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,669
to influence this we have density

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,320
independent effects these are effects

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,720
they're independent of the population

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,089
size but still regulate growth

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,429
most of these are aspects of the

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,349
external environment such as weather

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,989
related events such as droughts storms

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,140
and floods are also physical disruptions

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,299
such as fire in road construction in

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,609
contrast the density independent effects

16
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,649
we have something called density

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,149
dependent effects these effects are

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,820
dependent on the population size and

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,859
after regulate growth these effects have

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,558
an increase in effect on the popu as the

21
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,628
population size increases so the more

22
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,640
people you have the greater influence

23
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:55,349
these effects may have only the

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,020
increased population will be a birth

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,030
rates or emigration a neutral change

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,198
would be migration within an area the

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,180
way to decrease population density

28
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,780
dependent factors B through death rates

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,740
and emigration so if we look at a graph

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,969
here is the picture here we see the line

31
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:20,368
a line B and line C which one of these

32
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,829
curves shows the effect of density

33
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:26,489
dependent factors and which one of these

34
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:29,609
curves shows density in dependent factor

35
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:32,188
keeping in mind our density independent

36
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,900
ones are externally such as they could

37
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,149
be examples of droughts storms and

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,280
floods density dependent could be birth

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,520
rates or death rates

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,899
immigration or emigration so the answers

41
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,009
here if you look at these graphs here

42
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,849
you're welcome to pause the video and

43
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,489
take a guess yourself answers would be

44
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:52,649
density dependent would be B here

45
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,289
because we are limiting our population

46
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,879
growth and it is the independent factors

47
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,549
can be like storms and floods and

48
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:03,089
droughts and floods so I could see a lot

49
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,770
more variability that occurs in saloons

50
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,990
our population density remember carrying

51
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,549
capacity is the maximum amount of

52
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,109
individuals in particular environment

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,510
can hold but we want to maximize

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,280
population productivity

55
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,620
harvesting organisms so this could be

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,938
for example fish in the ocean the goal

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,519
of our sea urchins for commercial

58
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:22,949
purposes is to maximize net productivity

59
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,158
this area here would be the maximum

60
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:29,068
sustainable yield or optimum yield lies

61
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:30,509
partially up the similar curve so if

62
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:32,280
we're looking at harvesting individuals

63
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,439
it's really the maximum air we want to

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,299
harvest this will allow the population

65
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,400
kind of bounce back and help will

66
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,109
regulate itself we don't want to harvest

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,189
it all the way down here we don't want

68
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:43,379
it to go all the way up to the very

69
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:46,109
maximum it's kind of in the middle here

70
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:50,009
is the maximum sustainable yield of a

71
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:52,170
population on three the area where we

72
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,818
can be able to harvest individuals in

73
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:56,429
this case could be example for fish

74
00:02:53,818 --> 00:03:00,108
without hurting the total population

75
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,109
that naturally exists
