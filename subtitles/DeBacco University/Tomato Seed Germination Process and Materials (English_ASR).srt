1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,278
I'm going to provide you with a basic

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,258
guide on tomato seed germination and the

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,289
materials you need to basically allow

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,780
this process to happen so first off the

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,539
checklist you need plastic cells growing

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,669
medium containers heat matte light with

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,989
the timer and humidity dome can be

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,179
advised depending on your particular

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,399
location I'll go over these a little bit

10
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,079
more detail so first off the plastic

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,640
cells well typically they're all the

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,070
same area they're usually about a 10 by

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,260
10 inches by 20 inches and the higher

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,420
the cell count the smaller the plug size

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,239
so if you're dealing with that same area

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,450
in a 512 cell tray those gonna be very

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,159
very small cells 98 cell tray and that

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,250
same 10 by 20 air there's gonna be much

19
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,648
larger cells the 128th are the typical

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,320
standard that's used for most crops

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,079
including Tomatoes here if you're a

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,480
large operation you may want to consider

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,910
a vacuum cedar while they are typically

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,968
around $600 it's very efficient method

25
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,218
is you can do about 120 flats an hour

26
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,099
and it's about 15,000 seeds in one hour

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,560
I included a link to youtube video about

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,379
it and also a link to where you can look

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,240
at prices for those now growing medium

30
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,129
there's something called seed starting

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,959
mix which is finer and it's important

32
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:18,569
for small seeds like tomatoes for good

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,039
soil and moisture contact if you're up

34
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,169
potting going from a small container to

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,700
a larger container then you can use more

36
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,950
traditional potting mixes can be

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,450
considered Pro mix is often considered

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,859
to be the standard but there's many

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,280
different types out there for

40
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,810
consideration all the containers you can

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,909
depend on the final planting spot and

42
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,100
method you choose to use cal pots are

43
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,960
biodegradable on the soil it needs to be

44
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,609
planted so the rim is that exposed to

45
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,188
the air so if you're starting something

46
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,719
in a cow pot go plant that directly into

47
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,819
the field and don't have to worry about

48
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,200
it plastic pots are cheap and widely

49
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,209
available and you would have to kind of

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,210
transplant the tomato out of that if

51
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,429
you're going into the soil are a field

52
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,468
application there's also a fabric bags

53
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,320
that can hold plants all season if soil

54
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,298
is not conducive to planting in this

55
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,459
could be for very small operations this

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,680
could be for people selling plants that

57
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,449
want for in markets that want to be put

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,170
on a patio or something there's just

59
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,919
another option there for tomatoes seed

60
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,509
germination

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,699
after that sealing germinates is gonna

62
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,919
need light they're starting them indoors

63
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,079
that can be a concern there's many

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,849
options and the goal is to supply your

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
plant light so it doesn't get too leggy

66
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,810
a lot of people use shop lights because

67
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,479
they're a cheap option they're kind of a

68
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,250
poor selection because they need to be

69
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,329
kept almost touching the plants they

70
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,300
don't really don't produce a great

71
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,010
spectrum of light t5 fluorescents are

72
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,680
higher output lights and they're much

73
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:44,849
preferred option despite their increased

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,890
cost ceramic metal halides see mh's our

75
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,139
current recommendation due to the less

76
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,708
bulbs and improved light production over

77
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:54,539
our traditional t5 s and LEDs might be

78
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,550
the best option but for just looking at

79
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:58,519
seedlings probably not at the cost

80
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,439
probably is not justifiable at this time

81
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,289
whenever we're using we do want to be

82
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,569
mindful of the light age in the life

83
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:08,069
expectancy of the bulb were using and

84
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,989
even though they said my producing light

85
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,519
that we can see and appears to be bright

86
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:17,039
it may not be of high planted value

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,200
media domes can also be considered great

88
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,569
for the germination process to reduce

89
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,459
the need for watering which may disrupt

90
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,680
the radical as that little tiny tomato

91
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,569
seed starts in Germany for especially

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,489
small and fragile seedlings

93
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,560
it can also consider a misting system

94
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,530
depending on the production and scale to

95
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,810
live the fine mist find moisture to the

96
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,789
medium and also increase the humidity in

97
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,110
the propagation area and then there's

98
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:41,969
good old fashioned watering can is

99
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,620
another thing just be careful that

100
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,349
you're not disturbing the seeds too much

101
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,319
or you might disrupt that delicate

102
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,120
germination process heat mat is a good

103
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,459
idea to get a thermostat there's not one

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,129
already included goals to have that soil

105
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,450
be around in 70 to 75 keep in mind in

106
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,659
this case warmer is not better

107
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:03,060
anything over 85 can hurt or decrease

108
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,039
your germination rate this is kind of

109
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,449
that overview that basic process there

110
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,060
start seeds about six weeks before

111
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:12,328
intended planting day I would advise

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,108
germination mix trays with a high cell

113
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:18,418
count we're gonna have a smaller area so

114
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,918
I save just about a 120 you want to put

115
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,779
it in an area where the seeds gonna be

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,788
around 7 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit

117
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,159
typically that be supplied as bottom

118
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:29,209
heat and using an efficient for a light

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,210
would be recommend it
