1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,379
okay here we're going to be looking at

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,150
the three primary nutrients now the

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,730
reason why I have the picture here is

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,839
typically these three primary nutrients

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,519
are ones that were going to be kind of

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,679
rescuing the plant with it could be

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,539
feeding the plant and our ones that if

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,670
they show a deficiency would be the

9
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,559
first we would go through and add or at

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,990
least rule out if it's not the nutrient

11
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,549
deficiency that we notice first one

12
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,079
being nitrogen so we're looking at a

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,609
fertilizer value the three numbers that

14
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,799
are indicated there are nitrogen

15
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,330
phosphorus and potassium nitrogen is a

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,130
key component of proteins and

17
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:34,140
chlorophyll both which are involved in

18
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,090
the synthesis and transfer of energy

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,890
it helps plants with rapid growth of

20
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,230
leaves it gives that merkon that

21
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,600
satisfaction of adding fertilizer and

22
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,308
seeing the plant grow nitrogen often

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,109
comes from fertilizer applications and

24
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:48,628
can be fixed from the air by legumes and

25
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,549
also some soil bacteria however while

26
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,979
gives that nice rapid growth of leaves I

27
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,509
caution you because over-application can

28
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,009
cause plants to have long Internode's

29
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,659
brittle dark green leaves it can be

30
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,549
difficult to route when cuttings are

31
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,919
taken we see here with the giant pumpkin

32
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,319
the example what it looks like a plant

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
that is overfed and nitrogen get these

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,459
kind of bloated dark green leaves these

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,530
really long stretch stretch to the

36
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,839
stalks here and also get some splitting

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,659
that can occur all these are negative

38
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,189
effects of adding too much nitrogen now

39
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,590
phosphorus is an essential part of the

40
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,658
process also for photosynthesis it's a

41
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,060
critical component of DNA as we see here

42
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,469
in that sugar backbone it encourages

43
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,909
root growth and blooming and it's

44
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,129
typically added if you see a bloom

45
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,170
fertilizer typically it'll have a lot

46
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,688
more elevated levels of phosphorous in

47
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,460
it also comes in fertilizer it's the

48
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,099
middle number keep in mind and it's also

49
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,629
present in manures if you over add

50
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,399
manures while there are great organic

51
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,679
source of nutrients a lot of times you

52
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,409
can over add your phosphorus I have the

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,600
match stick here because there's

54
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,579
phosphorous in the area where you strike

55
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,828
it against the box of the mattress some

56
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,328
sort of rough and surface

57
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:56,158
last one is potassium as our primary

58
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,529
nutrient it's absorbed by plants in

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,530
larger amounts in other mineral elements

60
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,478
except nitrogen in some cases calcium I

61
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,299
can see here being added in very large

62
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,189
bags to be spread on a field potassium

63
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,849
is supplied by plants by soil minerals

64
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,870
organic materials and also fertilizer

65
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:13,919
it's involved with carbohydrate

66
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,110
metabolism fruit from

67
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,208
and disease resistance as you're getting

68
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,520
later in season typically potassium

69
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,229
demands will increase in the plant I

70
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,510
just remind you that potassium is

71
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,699
represented by the letter K phosphorus

72
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:28,439
by the letter P keep those straight and

73
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,349
try not to get those confused a lot of

74
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,310
students will mix up potassium and

75
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,310
phosphorus
