1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,640
okay here we look at the path that food

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:07,638
takes to the stomach now it's not this

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,839
kind of nice even path in the woods

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,210
there's a couple of interesting things

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,879
that do happen and how we get food to

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,440
move down on a controlled manner we're

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,778
going to investigate that further here

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,789
so starting with the pharynx now that's

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,948
colored here in purple

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,810
it's the throat as you may know that as

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,359
its involved in both digestion and

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,640
respiration so this is not dedicated

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,460
only to the digestive process it's

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,980
receiving food from in the air from the

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,370
mouth so here's again our oral cavity

16
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,558
here and the nasal cavity so air is both

17
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,649
coming in when food enters the fairies

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:48,539
involuntary muscles contractions close

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,910
off the air passageway so we see our

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,489
pharynx we're closing off the air

21
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,078
pathway to allow food to go down the

22
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,218
esophagus which is right here

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,230
we don't want food to go down this way

24
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,090
into the trachea because this is leading

25
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,649
to our lungs and it's gonna lead to

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,030
choking so we want

27
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,770
there's involuntary muscles when food

28
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,349
enters this will get closed off so that

29
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,629
our food can enter the esophagus

30
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,780
continue down his path towards the

31
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,548
stomach now the Swan of a bolus part is

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,469
fog the tongue moves back and forth in

33
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,110
the mouth you can see we're looking at

34
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,450
that food bolus here the soft palate

35
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,549
will elevate yours our tongue soft

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,978
palate will elevate pushing back walls

37
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,868
of pharynx this stimulates neurons to

38
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,179
send impulses to the Swan Center in the

39
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,909
brain and muscles will contract and

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,259
raised of earrings you see here so again

41
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,969
here's where we don't want the food to

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,250
go down this is leading ultimately to

43
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,750
our lungs the glottis which is right

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,239
here it's pushed back against the

45
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,000
epiglottis which keeps food out of the

46
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,039
respiratory tract and in the esophagus

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,420
we see that occurring here see it's open

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,549
here allowing air to come in and out

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,649
here we're closing that off to allow

50
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,840
food to continue down to the esophagus

51
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,030
and here once it's passed it can open

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,219
back up and we can breathe again

53
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,750
allowing our gas exchange so it's

54
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,849
important in this process occurs and we

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,500
close off that so if you choke we get

56
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,209
something you know goes down the wrong

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,068
pipe that's literally where this term

58
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,569
comes from because it's going down here

59
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,359
the TREC get instead of the esophagus

60
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:18,009
a little zoomed in version here the

61
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,269
epiglottis is a very important structure

62
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,699
here and that's representative right

63
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:23,468
here this is a flap of cartilage that

64
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,060
covers the windpipe turns swallow and

65
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:27,188
prevents food from entering the larynx

66
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,810
we don't want food to go down here so

67
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:31,628
when we're swallowing those tongues

68
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,878
moving this is the epiglottis closing

69
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:37,449
off here allowing food to go down the

70
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:38,919
esophagus and not the trachea now the

71
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,869
esophagus in the stomach the esophagus

72
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,988
is a muscular tube that connects the

73
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,579
fairness to the stomach swine's Center

74
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,139
stimulates successive waves of

75
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:50,469
contraction so how do I get that food to

76
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:52,959
move down there well peristalsis is if

77
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:56,199
you or seeing in this image moves full

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,989
fluid along the esophagus to the stomach

79
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,000
this food is moving along in a very

80
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:02,560
controlled manner and we may think all

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,329
just gravity is doing that we'll notice

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,639
actually it's a controlled set of

83
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,169
muscles it's kind of like squeezing a

84
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,260
toothpaste as you're working it down

85
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:12,969
this way if you were to be on your side

86
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,098
or even upside down in an extreme case

87
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:16,239
daily food would still move to the

88
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:19,388
stomach because of the muscle

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,949
contractions that's occurring now the

90
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,139
esophagus is its location it's a hollow

91
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:26,169
muscular tube it's about ten inches long

92
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:28,780
about two centimeters are about eight

93
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,909
tenths of an inch wide it could be solid

94
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,128
food and lipids to the stomach

95
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:34,298
ultimately I put this image here so we

96
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,918
can kind of see where it's located in

97
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,840
relation to the heart just remember

98
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,879
there are other organs involved here and

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,709
in this case it would be behind the

100
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:43,658
heart here that would be where our

101
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,250
esophagus would be located so it's

102
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:47,439
behind the heart when we're looking at

103
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,739
the end topical organization of all our

104
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,419
organs the movement of the digestion

105
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,400
materials this muscular layers to just

106
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,229
subtract it's smooth muscle this

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,569
peristalsis is the key part has a

108
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:01,269
rhythmic contractions and it's allowing

109
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:02,978
that food to be pushed down here moves

110
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,750
food through the digestive tract also in

111
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,090
alternating waves of muscle contraction

112
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,009
relaxation we kind of see that indicated

113
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,989
here we have alternating contraction

114
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:13,388
relaxing rejection is actually moving

115
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:16,060
that food through the digestive system

116
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:19,780
it can also be used here from mixing of

117
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,608
that food items also we have the stomach

118
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,019
and the gastric glands movement of the

119
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,759
food from the esophagus to the stomach

120
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:27,740
is controlled by a rain of food muscle

121
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:31,000
called a sphincter here we see these

122
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,199
is open here we have the center closed

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,930
humans lack kind of a true sphincter and

124
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,160
thus can be bigger jet eat food items it

125
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,348
was a true sphincter would not allow

126
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,569
that to occur we want this sphincter

127
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:44,240
though to be very functional because now

128
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,129
I don't want food to be able to add to

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,460
the stomach we don't want all the high

130
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:52,038
stomach acid that we have here entering

131
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:53,478
our esophagus if we do have a failure of

132
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,899
this finger that's how we get heartburn

133
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,758
it's the high amount of hydrogen ions so

134
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:01,339
very low pH the hydrochloric acid

135
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,259
entering our very sensitive esophagus

136
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,469
causing that burning feeling on

137
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,470
ourselves
