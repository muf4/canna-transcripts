1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
have you ever heard the term rosin

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,240
related to cannabis and wondered what it

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
was

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,519
this debaco university video will help

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,080
explain

6
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,839
exactly what this is and talked a little

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,920
bit about the extraction process it

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,920
takes to make rosin

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,118
[Music]

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,278
so what is rosin from cannabis well

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,039
let's get into that answer right here on

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,359
this video lecture

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
so description of the method of making

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,480
rosin well

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,119
the desired material is broken down into

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,919
roughly 0.2 to 0.5 gram increments

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,718
and placed on a rectangular shape inside

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
a filtering

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,920
mesh we kind of see a little bit of that

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,679
picture right here

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,840
and kind of see that process going on up

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,079
here as well material inside the mesh

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,879
filter is placed in between two sheets

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,799
of parchment paper and a rosin press is

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,519
preheated to desired temperature

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,320
typically increased up from 250 degrees

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,120
fahrenheit

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,679
or 122 degrees celsius the exact

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,358
protocol

30
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,759
might depend on the machine might depend

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
on exactly uh what you're looking at

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,478
extracting here

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,400
you can kind of see an example of that

34
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,159
quick version of that process here

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
and then we see here setting the

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,680
temperature here

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,759
keep in mind 250 degrees fahrenheit or

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,118
122 degrees celsius be aware of the

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,799
units

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,239
now the process there you can kind of

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
see kind of the end process coming

42
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,959
through here is that the mesh of the

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
materials placed

44
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,599
in the preheated rosin press and at a

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
constant pressure is applied and kind of

46
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,359
see the press going on right up here

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
within one to five minutes the rosin

48
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,519
will have been extracted from the mesh

49
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,959
bag

50
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,118
and should be followed down the

51
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,280
parchment paper pressure is released and

52
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,078
the resulting rosin extract is cooled to

53
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,079
allow it to

54
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,279
solidify you kind of see it here in the

55
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,279
liquidy portion

56
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
that would then be cooled to then

57
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,280
produce that kind of

58
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,920
solid portion that could then be applied

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,200
to the next given situations

60
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,799
so the resulting end product what does

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
that solid product kind of look like

62
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,680
well

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,520
the resulting product of the rosin press

64
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,079
is the rosin it's solvent-less

65
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,840
extract that contain upwards of 80 thc

66
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,118
and holds many of the terpenes from the

67
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
original plant material

68
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,360
this is part reason why it is so popular

69
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,519
you can see examples of that here

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
could also have like artisan versions of

71
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,280
rosin we're kind of making

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,959
art almost with a rosin end product

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,039
now what are the advantages of ros and

74
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,680
we can see some other examples of

75
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,280
press indicated here the advantages of

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,239
rosin is that the method is completely

77
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,520
solventless

78
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,920
making rosin one of the purest

79
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,360
concentrates available relatively simple

80
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,958
and easy process with minimal

81
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
specialized equipment required

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
cost effective when compared with other

83
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,559
extraction methods and rising prices are

84
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
not limited just to commercial

85
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
operations

86
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,200
here releasing a hydraulic jack pump

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,598
that could be used to

88
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,399
pump up a car to change a tire can still

89
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,439
be applied

90
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
here how are the disadvantages of rosin

91
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,318
are that high pressure

92
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,518
rosin presses can be extremely dangerous

93
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,518
if they're misused

94
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,120
it's also easy to burn the extract if

95
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
not properly pressed and after that

96
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,480
temperature can be so critical

97
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
professional grade rosin equipment can

98
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,639
become costly however it's still much

99
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,760
cheaper

100
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,199
than a standard closed loop system now

101
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,039
we're talking about ros and just one

102
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,318
other point that i did want to mention

103
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,400
is that the difference between live

104
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,399
rosin and live resin

105
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,158
so do not confuse the two end products

106
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,640
rosin which has been the focus here

107
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,280
is considered to be salvo solvent-less

108
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,039
extract

109
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,239
that maintains the chemical profile of

110
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,400
the plant without the risk of

111
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,000
potentially hazardous chemicals

112
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,640
resin is a solvent-based extract

113
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,598
resins usually comes derived from butane

114
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,598
hash oil

115
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,839
that is made with live or freshly frozen

116
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,238
plant material and processed in a single

117
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
pass

118
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
extraction it's used to capture the

119
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,319
plant's terpene and cannabinoid profile

120
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,560
by processing the resin glands before

121
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,639
the plant is dried and cured

122
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,759
so keep in mind that while these may

123
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,199
look really quick

124
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,199
uh the same and there might only be one

125
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,958
letter difference the end product

126
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,479
is very different so it's important to

127
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,039
understand the difference between the

128
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,438
two

129
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,798
and the focus here has been rosin i did

130
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,560
not want to leave you out with just a

131
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,599
little description of what resin is and

132
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,400
how it's different

133
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,399
than the production of live rosin
