00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,160
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,000
going to go over some more

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,599
of the specifics when you're looking at

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,080
flipping your plants or transitioning

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,160
them

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,160
from the vegetative to the flowering

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,359
cycles

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,199
[Music]

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,118
all right let's go over flipping indoor

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,118
cannabis plants from the vegetative to

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,879
flowering cycles

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,800
so first off the change when we're

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,000
looking at making that change

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
uh growers growing photoperiod dependent

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,119
or even autoflower plants need to

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,840
realize their plants need to go through

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,079
a shift

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
from reducing leaves to flowers now in

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320
autoflowers of course that will happen

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,760
naturally

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
photoperiod dependent you have the

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,960
opportunity to decide when that change

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,200
occurs

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,799
so because with photoperiod dependent

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
strains growers have more control over

26
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,320
when this actually happens

27
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,839
there needs to be a consideration for

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
how to best prepare the plant

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,039
to maximize your growing efficiency also

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,718
if you're using

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,719
light sources that have strong red

32
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
wavelengths such as high pressure sodium

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
this will increase intensities for

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,118
plants to stretch

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
so just be mindful if you're in a

36
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,400
ceiling or height limited growing

37
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,640
situation

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,719
now the photoperiod itself well for

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,079
photoperiod dependent cultivars a simple

40
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,640
switch from an 18 plus

41
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,679
hours of continuous light to 12 hours of

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,719
continuous light

43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,759
will shift the plant at any age to focus

44
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,158
on flower production

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
and development autoflowers are based on

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,920
the

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,280
days old and the day that the plants

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,799
will shift from vegetative to flying

49
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
will depend on the exact strain

50
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
grown so keep in mind with those

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
photoperiod dependent you have the

52
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,759
option

53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,600
you could do it really really small i

54
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,239
could do it in the really tall doesn't

55
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,078
really

56
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,679
matter to the plant once it's exposed to

57
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,239
that 12 hours it's going to go through

58
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,560
and produce

59
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,920
those development of those flowers as

60
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
growers need to be mindful of

61
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
how our plants look so we can maximize

62
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,280
the efficiency

63
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:52,959
now light limitations with the

64
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,320
photoperiod dependent photoperiod

65
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,839
dependent strains will only

66
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,519
allow growers to provide it with 12

67
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
hours of light should be the maximum

68
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,879
light intensity

69
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,839
in supplementing with carbon dioxide so

70
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,599
their plants use

71
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
highlight intensity since the duration

72
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,919
will no longer be the 12 hours per day

73
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,199
why is that light intensity important

74
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,679
well the goal is to try to maintain a

75
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,399
high

76
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,280
dli which stands for daily light

77
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,200
integral

78
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
so because you're reducing the duration

79
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,759
of lights you're limited by how much

80
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,520
increasing the intensity is advised now

81
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,159
to allow plants to utilize that higher

82
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,239
intensity

83
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,680
sampling with carbon dioxide enrichment

84
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,920
for indoor locations

85
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
it will allow plants to utilize a

86
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,079
greater percentage

87
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,439
or intensity of light

88
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
now when we're looking at photoperiod

89
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,000
independence such as autoflowers what do

90
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,598
we do with

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
those if we're choosing to grow those

92
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,799
plants however the advantage of

93
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
autoflowers being photoperiod

94
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
independent is that they can handle

95
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,159
longer durations of light to help

96
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
maximize light which is important

97
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,439
considerations for growers

98
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,959
since the days of plant production are

99
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,239
limited what does that mean

100
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,159
since it doesn't matter kind of what you

101
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,239
expose them to for light

102
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,359
running them running lights longer for

103
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,439
autoflowers can help

104
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,440
increase productivity because you're

105
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,878
giving them a better chance

106
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,120
to go through and produce those

107
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,959
necessary sugars and cannabinoids

108
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,158
however while the cost of running lights

109
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,080
and potential cooling

110
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,079
should also be factored in because

111
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
running plants for 20 hours at high

112
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
intensity with carbon dioxide can help

113
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,679
maximize the harvest from these plants

114
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,598
because this will maximize the dli the

115
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
daily light integral that those plants

116
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,318
receive

117
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,399
if you are increasing the intensity keep

118
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,079
in mind there's only so much plants can

119
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
use under ambient carbon dioxide levels

120
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
so enriching that environment

121
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,878
will increase the intensity that they

122
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,399
can utilize

123
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,000
now as i mentioned ceiling height is an

124
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
important consideration so if your grow

125
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,560
space is ceiling height limited this can

126
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,878
impact

127
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
when the flip is made for photoperiod

128
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:41,439
dependence

129
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,439
and or the pruning style you use for

130
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,239
autoflowers remember that just because

131
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,719
plants are

132
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
in flower development mode doesn't mean

133
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,039
that they will stop

134
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
growing in vertical height they still

135
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,079
will continue to grow in height

136
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,238
while not as much as is in the

137
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,319
vegetative stage if you are growing a

138
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
sativa dominant strain this will stretch

139
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,798
more than an indica dominant in

140
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,280
morphology regardless of the increase in

141
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,519
height

142
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,598
can be around 50 percent so just keep

143
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,080
that in mind just because they stop

144
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,280
they're going to continue to grow this

145
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
is important when considering the

146
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,239
distance plant should be kept from

147
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
lights you're using

148
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
overall this height limitation tends to

149
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,319
be more of an issue for smaller grow

150
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,399
tents

151
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,839
than actual grow rooms but just because

152
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,198
the ceiling is high doesn't mean

153
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,758
you have to also consider where the

154
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,240
lights are hanging as well

155
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
now plant age so with autoflowers plant

156
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,319
age determines the transition point

157
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,359
for photoperiod dependent growers may

158
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,719
decide to

159
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
make the change in the photo period

160
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,320
based on the plant's age again to

161
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
maximize productivity and efficiency of

162
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,199
their grow operation

163
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,879
the best age is dependent on many

164
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,280
factors such as pruning style

165
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,879
if physical space of the growing air and

166
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,319
physical space of the growing area

167
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,918
however general starting point is to

168
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,040
float plants into flower when they have

169
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,560
reached about half

170
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,240
their total height you want them to

171
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,079
reach just as a heads up

172
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,840
now looking at up potting plants so this

173
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,439
is another important part of the process

174
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,799
many growers take the time around

175
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,478
flipping their plants to change their

176
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
containers or up pop their plants

177
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,719
this is typically a good idea however be

178
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,478
sure not to plan everything on the same

179
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,400
day might be great for the grower

180
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,680
not so great for the plants idea the

181
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,120
plants should be up potted and then

182
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,639
growers should wait about three days

183
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
before altering the photo period to

184
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,918
induce flowering

185
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,959
simply to reduce the stress that's going

186
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,240
on the plant

187
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,839
after the potting process that's going

188
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
to be a stress on the plant and if you

189
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,839
flip it the same day that could be too

190
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,879
much and could stunt the plant

191
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,000
potentially so what you're planning for

192
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,478
this stretch this kind of gives you just

193
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
a little bit of a kind of an image here

194
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,680
uh as an example in this case the pla

195
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,639
the tent height is

196
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
7 feet or 84 inches we see right here

197
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,879
the top

198
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,399
of the tent to the bottom of the lights

199
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,560
is 21 inches

200
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,560
so we're looking basically right here

201
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,918
with 16 inch spacing between the plants

202
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,079
and lights required

203
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,359
to give a total of 63 inches of grow

204
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,079
space remaining

205
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
and that is located basically right here

206
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,159
so the container is

207
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
13 inches tall resulting in total of 50

208
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,439
inches

209
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,639
of equipment height space being taken up

210
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,759
so just because you have this total

211
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
height of the grow tent

212
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,800
you also have to consider the distance

213
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,400
your

214
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,079
lights are hanging from the top the

215
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,439
distance the soil line is

216
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,359
up from the bottom so this limits 34

217
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,079
inches of plant height in the growing

218
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,080
space

219
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,839
so when plants reach 50 percent of

220
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,478
possible growing space in this case

221
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,318
17 inches the flowering photo period

222
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,439
should be initiated at least as a good

223
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,600
starting point

224
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,519
so here we're thinking oh 7 feet 84

225
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,199
inches plenty of growing space

226
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,519
well really when it comes to actual

227
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,319
plant space you only have about 34

228
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,918
inches

229
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,080
so again take all these factors into

230
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,599
consideration so you don't get caught

231
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,439
with your plants running into the lights

232
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,039
or having to do something

233
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,959
that's not going to be very plant

234
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,478
conducive take into consideration the

235
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,839
actual growing height initiate that

236
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,439
flowering halfway through

237
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,599
and that should offer you a very good

238
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,240
starting point for your plants to

239
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,680
determine

240
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,598
when you should flip them from the

241
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,160
vegetative photo period to the flowering

242
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,159
one
