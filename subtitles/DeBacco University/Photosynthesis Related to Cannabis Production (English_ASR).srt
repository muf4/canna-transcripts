00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,759
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,439
where i'm going to go over

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,129
photosynthesis related to cannabis

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,300
production

5
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,300
[Music]

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,118
all right let's look at some of the

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,640
plant physiology and relate it to

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,239
cannabis production

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
so first off we have to understand the

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,239
basic equation and this is the basic

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
photosynthetic equation

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,518
any reactant in reactants here on the

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,719
left

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,640
can be a limiting reactant as far as

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,960
generating sugars and oxygen

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
so carbon dioxide is easily a limiting

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
factor especially during high light

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,959
intensities

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
so as growers to maximize plant

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,920
production typically sugars

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,439
in the end we want to make sure the

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
carbon dioxide the water and the light

23
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,159
are not

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,520
going to be limiting as far as the plant

25
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,279
is concerned

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
so we'll start with the light component

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,759
well that light spectrum

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,198
and remember we're looking here at the

29
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,479
visible light spectrum so if you look

30
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,238
here we can see all these different

31
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,599
wavelengths of light correspond with

32
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,279
different colors

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
overall the reds are the longer

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
wavelengths compared to the

35
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,799
violets in the blues here and these are

36
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,478
all measured in nanometers

37
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
and for plants we're seeing some

38
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,599
increased importance with also the

39
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,920
ultraviolet spectrum

40
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,319
as well as the infrared which are areas

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,439
outside of the visible spectrum

42
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,118
so looking at a comparison spectrum

43
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,798
this is a representative solar spectrum

44
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,799
looking at basically the sun

45
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,320
this is the kind of we're looking here

46
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,159
is the output of the sun

47
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,919
and what it produces as far as different

48
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
wavelengths go and wavelengths are

49
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
measured in nanometers

50
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,920
so this is sampled from 350 to 850 just

51
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,959
to give an idea of

52
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,079
the representative solar spectrum so

53
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,478
when we're looking at plants well

54
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,039
chlorophyll is important chlorophyll

55
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,679
in any form relates to the green

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
pigments

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
found in the mesosomes of cyanobacteria

58
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,118
and

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,479
in the chloroplast of algae in plants

60
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,359
chlorophyll is essential in

61
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,078
photosynthesis

62
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,560
allowing plants to absorb energy from

63
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:56,718
light

64
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,399
taking that light energy and ultimately

65
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,839
going to go and convert it to chemical

66
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
energy such as sugars

67
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,960
chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
in the blue portion of the

69
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,640
electromagnetic spectrum

70
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
as well as the red portion but don't

71
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
take that to mean that it's only

72
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
absorbing those

73
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
even though we see the green color that

74
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,239
means it's reflecting green

75
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,159
there is some green light that is still

76
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,719
absorbed within plants

77
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,318
conversely is a is a poor absorber of

78
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,959
green or near green portions of the

79
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,439
spectrum

80
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,120
which reflects producing the green color

81
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,959
of chlorophyll containing tissues

82
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,039
but it still is absorbing some of that

83
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
green light two types of chlorophyll

84
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,000
exist

85
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
in photosynthesis plants uh they are

86
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,719
chlorophyll a

87
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,878
as well as chlorophyll b now looking

88
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,919
here plants absorbing more than just

89
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,439
chlorophyll

90
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,280
so while chlorophyll does get a lot of

91
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,878
attention we also did take into

92
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
consideration more than square fill and

93
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,840
chlorophyll b

94
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,439
there's also different compounds that

95
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,598
are absorbing different wavelengths

96
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,560
this is allowing the plant through

97
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,280
basically what's called an

98
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,959
antenna complex to utilize more of the

99
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,519
wavelengths of light that it's exposed

100
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
to

101
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
so this is helpful to the plant because

102
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
it's not just needing these finite

103
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,518
little wavelengths

104
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
it's being able to utilize a greater

105
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,519
portion of the light it's exposed to so

106
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
here's that kind of utilization of

107
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
different wavelengths of light and i get

108
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
my sources right here kind of gives you

109
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,238
a nice little visual comparison here

110
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,759
where we're seeing that green light yes

111
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,158
it is absorbing less

112
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,000
but less does not mean in this case zero

113
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,919
so as a result this you can see that

114
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,919
definitely in that bluer purple range

115
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,079
and whereas that orange and red range

116
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,280
we're seeing a greater percentage of

117
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
relative response

118
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,759
but all wavelengths are being utilized

119
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,840
in some way with plants

120
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
so here's a research article looking at

121
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,439
kind of the photosynthetic response here

122
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,039
with variations with the photosynthetic

123
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,000
photon flux densities

124
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,519
abbreviated ppfd so that's going to be

125
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,959
important here and this is a great

126
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,400
article if you wanted to research it

127
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,840
further

128
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
so when we're looking at cannabis

129
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,640
because this is focused initially on

130
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,760
cannabis here

131
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,958
is that canvas is a high light intensity

132
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,438
plant

133
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,519
sunlight has a light intensity of

134
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,039
measured in that photosynthetic

135
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,680
photon flux density of 2000 micromoles

136
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,239
per meter squared per second however is

137
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,640
not economical to provide

138
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,878
this light level for an indoor operation

139
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,199
canvas is often given around a thousand

140
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,000
micromoles per second to aid in plant

141
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,159
quality

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,918
in comparison a low light intensity

143
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,880
plant such as lettuce can grow well in

144
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,478
only 200

145
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,159
micromoles per second squared we can see

146
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,599
that evident right here where it almost

147
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
grows produces a little bit larger

148
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
leaves

149
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
compared to the higher light intensities

150
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,439
so this is why it's important

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,439
to try to find research on the

152
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,879
particular crop that is of interest

153
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,478
of you so that ppfd and temperature how

154
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,680
do these kind of correlate or how do

155
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,519
they kind of relate

156
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,439
it's important to take all environmental

157
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,799
conditions into consideration

158
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,639
so keep in mind that for the

159
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
abbreviation ci's

160
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,079
internal co2 concentration ca's external

161
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
concentration

162
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,758
looking particularly at cannabis leaves

163
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,439
here

164
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
so what the researchers found is that a

165
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,639
combination of 30 degrees

166
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,000
celsius in temperature and 1 500

167
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,960
micromoles

168
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,199
measured with a ppfd may be best

169
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,399
suitable for indoor cultivation of

170
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
cannabis plants in this case the

171
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,399
cannabis sativa that they were looking

172
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:09,680
at

173
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,758
so this kind of gives you an idea of the

174
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
light intensity but also the temperature

175
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
to maybe set as your targets if you're

176
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,439
looking at maximizing

177
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,280
yield of cannabis so when we're looking

178
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,759
at light we also need to consider the

179
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,879
light

180
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,080
quantity and also the light quality so

181
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,719
light quantity or dli which correlates

182
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,959
more with biomass and dli is the daily

183
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
light intensity that it's getting so

184
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,560
more light equals more plant

185
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,478
at least following the biological curve

186
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,399
or plateau so it's not a linear

187
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,879
x kind of or an exponential curve it's

188
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,038
just kind of this plateauing region here

189
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,038
light quality or color which is a par

190
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,599
reading impacts the morphology of the

191
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,360
plant

192
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
so if you give your plant more of the

193
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,600
red wavelengths it has a tendency to

194
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,879
stretch more

195
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
it has it more of just the blue

196
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,199
wavelengths it tends to stay more

197
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
compact

198
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,960
closer internet you can also see here

199
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,199
that with light intensity

200
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,879
photosynthetic rate some areas can be

201
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
light limited some can be carbon dioxide

202
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,959
limited and this all goes back

203
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
to that photosynthetic equation and we

204
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,918
could hopefully see now

205
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
how those different components from an

206
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,519
equation you may have learned previously

207
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,519
now relates to cannabis production
