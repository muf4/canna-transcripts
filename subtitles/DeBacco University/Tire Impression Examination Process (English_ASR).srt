1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
so here we're going to look at tire

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,160
impressions and the examination process

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,679
for those tires being able to understand

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,759
the different types of tread

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,879
and what to look for so it's all going

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,119
to be covered here

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,480
in this video lecture so starting with

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,679
crime scene evidence versus

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,679
the known so the tire trade examinations

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,278
compare tire impressions recovered from

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,000
the scene with tires

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,599
taken from a known vehicle those two

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
categories of tires are the suspect the

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,879
vehicle

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,240
is suspected to have or be at the crime

16
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,238
scene and then we have

17
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,679
vehicles we need to also eliminate these

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,599
are vehicles it could be the police

19
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,000
ambulance or other sources for known

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
purposes all tires should be seized from

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,238
the suspect's vehicle

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,399
to allow an adequate comparison and

23
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,878
picture should be taken here as we see

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,679
also with the indication of that what's

25
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,920
red on the sidewall as well

26
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,519
these are class characteristics so keep

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
in mind class characteristics can be

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
used to eliminate suspects tire

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,320
or suggest a tire could have made the

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
track

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,759
these characters include the size the

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,359
tread design and wear marks

33
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,640
these aren't individual characteristics

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,198
they're just saying the same clasp with

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,079
the same

36
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,719
general type of tire could have made

37
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,478
those

38
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,239
particular tracks again we're looking at

39
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,560
some of the details here and this is why

40
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,359
images and photographs from the scene

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
can be so

42
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,400
important i mean this can lead to a

43
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
visual comparison these tire impressions

44
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
that result of transfer from

45
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
um tread detail entire against a

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
substrate in this case it could be

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,239
kind of this sand could be the actual

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,640
asphalt could be snow

49
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,280
it could be mud impressions can be made

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
here

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,118
it can be two or three dimensional

52
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,719
forensic examinations

53
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,719
can begin with visual comparisons to

54
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,560
eliminate tires which do not match the

55
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,200
impressions it's a great way to kind of

56
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,159
quickly eliminate or quickly classify

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,880
certain prints

58
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,320
just by using the visual cues known

59
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,560
tires collected should be inked

60
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,559
and have 3d impressions made for

61
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
comparison purposes

62
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,920
keep in mind you want to look at the

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640
entire tread you don't look at small

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,799
section

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,239
forensics examination continues with a

66
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,520
full circumference test of the

67
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,319
impressions this is where kind of like

68
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,879
ink the tire

69
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,599
you want to ink the entire circumference

70
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,478
of the tire

71
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,479
not just a small section impressions are

72
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,120
superimposed on known

73
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,679
impressions over cast or the original

74
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,239
tire

75
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,159
the goal is to try to find consistencies

76
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,400
or a unique abnormality

77
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,919
which such as a point of damage or

78
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,239
something caught in the tread

79
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,280
to try to match up that particular tire

80
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,400
with being present

81
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
at that part of the crime scene general

82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
tire

83
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
evaluation other factors that should be

84
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,318
investigated include the

85
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,840
tread design we want to be looking at

86
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,159
the

87
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
tread dimensions and noise treatments

88
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,680
potential wear features

89
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,680
and random individual characteristics as

90
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,360
you mentioned it could be a damage point

91
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,920
in the tire or potentially even a small

92
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,480
stone

93
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,679
caught in that tire because that can

94
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,199
lead us to the individual

95
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
characteristics that can help us

96
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,598
kind of use to identify an exact tire

97
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,079
remember individual characteristics can

98
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,238
change

99
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
over time that's why it's important try

100
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,719
to get the match to be as close as

101
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,959
possible

102
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,959
you could have the refilling point a

103
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,400
plug point be a nail in the tire

104
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,000
be the different wear marks different

105
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
cracks in the tire

106
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,199
or something kind of unique that's that

107
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,040
is wedged in that

108
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,560
end rubber there so again these are

109
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,560
individual characteristics and this can

110
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
really help solidify an argument

111
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
that that tire was present at the

112
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,000
particular scene that was documented

113
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,200
obtain an inked of the known standards

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
this is where it's important to kind of

115
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,119
get that instead of said that entire

116
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
circumference of the tire you can use an

117
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
ink surface that's longer than the total

118
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,959
circumference of the tire to ensure you

119
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
get everything

120
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,519
also have the surface to receive the ink

121
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
of equal or greater length so here's the

122
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
ink area you want to make sure you ink

123
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,958
the entire tire

124
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,719
you want to have an area where you can

125
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,360
transfer that tread over the entire

126
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,878
surface

127
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,640
because the goal is to obtain a full

128
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,120
circumference in compression

129
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,839
for that tire then we have something

130
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,759
called tread

131
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,598
blocks and these are tread designs are

132
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,959
comprised of tread blocks which vary in

133
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,759
size to help reduce

134
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,360
noise the arrangement never repeats and

135
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,798
is different on each side

136
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
which is why a full circumference

137
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
impression is so important

138
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,479
because you'll have the manufacturers

139
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
have different dimensions for those

140
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,560
tread blocks

141
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,199
to help reduce overall noise of the tire

142
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
while it's being driven you want to

143
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,719
offer comparison of the ink to the cast

144
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,478
so it's advised to pass the ink

145
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,280
compression directly over the cast to

146
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,199
try to identify

147
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,638
corresponding tread blocks and take that

148
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,360
and kind of kind of shift it to see if

149
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,079
you can get

150
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
different areas to match up the match is

151
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,120
found this can

152
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,960
the specific tire segment can be

153
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
compared to the actual tire

154
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,719
directly which can really strengthen an

155
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,680
argument

156
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,440
actual um to cast tire comparison the

157
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
blue tape is used to show the matching

158
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,759
segment

159
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
that the cast corresponds with because

160
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,319
the caster mirror is only going to be a

161
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,758
small portion of that tire

162
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,599
so here we're trying to determine well

163
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,360
where is it within that tire

164
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
so do you notice something unique either

165
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
in the cast would be a little harder to

166
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
see

167
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
or the actual tire well when you're

168
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
looking at

169
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,800
very close and look at looking at the

170
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,758
visual the photograph overlaid on top of

171
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,240
the cast shows

172
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,319
on this correlation where this stone

173
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
placement is an exact match so just go

174
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,199
back for one second here you can see

175
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
that there's these stones caught in the

176
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,879
tire and if you look very carefully

177
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,240
might get an indication of that stone

178
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,680
also showing up on the cast when you

179
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,560
kind of overlay those two

180
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,400
over one another it's very probable that

181
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,839
this tire made the cast impression at

182
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,359
the crime scene so here it's very

183
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,399
possible that with this visual match

184
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
that you have these individual

185
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,478
characteristics

186
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,360
that this kind of stone here matches up

187
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,159
with the cast

188
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,319
and the original tire indicating that

189
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,639
it's very likely or very probable

190
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,839
that this tire made the cast impression

191
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,840
found at the crime scene
