1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
okay here we're looking at nematodes are

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,500
nematodes you can see here both

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,570
pronunciations are fine they are not as

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,359
segmented worms meaning that these are

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,820
in fact animals so while they are very

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,149
small these are animals that can infect

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,250
plants now they're often overlooked and

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,439
they can affect the roots as well as the

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,149
leaves of plants the most commonly found

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,740
in the soil without and compete on the

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,229
roots that's probably their most notable

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,659
for root-knot nematode being worn that's

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,700
often talked about but they can there

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,170
are some that can infect the leaves as

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,910
well

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,320
now the identification you see here

17
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,929
these small worm-like structures they

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,109
are very simple organisms most are small

19
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:45,649
but can be a wide range from zero point

20
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:49,439
three millimeters to up to eight meters

21
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:51,929
long so keep in mind that size isn't

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,558
necessarily a way to positively identify

23
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,359
these because the range is so wide they

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,399
are non segmented worms they said these

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,320
are animals we're talking about there's

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,299
only about 20,000 species with some

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,609
actually being beneficial so what do you

28
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,500
think that all nematodes are negative

29
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,569
impacts on plants there's actually some

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,549
beneficial ones and they can be used to

31
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,179
help control other organisms for example

32
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,070
white grubs in lawns now we're to look

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,600
for these other typically found in soils

34
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,868
and can affect the roots you do the

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,158
first area people look for microscope is

36
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,009
often needed for positive identification

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,229
due to the fact that they are so small

38
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,969
for the most part and there are some I

39
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:31,590
get quite large but many of the

40
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,840
parasitic ones and ones that feed on the

41
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,180
plants are on the smaller end of that

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,310
scale they can also have a delayed

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,710
almost a three-week delay impact on

44
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,030
plants so when we finally start to see

45
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,709
some negative effects

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,409
well that initial infection could have

47
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:48,000
occurred up to three weeks ago and this

48
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,118
is in part why keeping records and

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,530
documentation is so important how to

50
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,390
prevent them while management is a

51
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,609
challenge so sanitation is highly

52
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,859
recommended invitations can reduce by

53
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,170
following soil for outdoor operations in

54
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,209
media solarization what this

55
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,000
solarization refers to is we're kind of

56
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,649
covering the area in this clear plastic

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,560
heating this soil up to extreme

58
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,539
temperatures causing the nematodes here

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,860
which are again animals to die

60
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,359
essentially

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,160
keep in mind that these will reduce the

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
nematodes mainly only in the upper six

63
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,689
to twelve inches of soil and do not

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,799
provide a long-term solution so this is

65
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,289
good for areas where you may have

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,390
increased pressure you may want to go

67
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,370
through and do this once I'll pull the

68
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,379
plastic up or take the media out kind of

69
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,330
remix it and do it again to ensure

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,930
you're getting an even kill throughout

71
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,880
the entire profile there otherwise those

72
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,349
become the very surface if they are

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,329
living below that where your roots tend

74
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,879
to go you just simply have infection

75
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,210
occur again how to control them well

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,759
because these are animals the products

77
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,620
usually used to control them are harmful

78
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,349
to humans and many as a result of

79
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,340
restricted use requires a license to be

80
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,919
able to use them there's strict

81
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,349
protocols involved few against target

82
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,149
the soil it need to be applied and are

83
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,099
then covered in seal to allow liquid

84
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,740
vapors to infiltrate the soil particles

85
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,659
again pretty harsh environment here

86
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,580
we're in a previous slide just to go

87
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,379
back for one moment we're saying this is

88
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,980
simply covering this and causing the

89
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:19,319
heat of the Sun to kind of surface

90
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:21,179
sterilize and Solarize the soil here

91
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,419
we're covering the soil but also adding

92
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,730
a fumigant a pesticide there if you're

93
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,609
an outdoor operation rotating broccoli

94
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:31,289
cauliflower grain sorghum or millet came

95
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,330
the lower root-knot nematodes if that's

96
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,919
your particular issue but keep in mind

97
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,530
that that's recommend these are grown

98
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,319
for two consecutive seasons so this

99
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,090
isn't grow broccoli for one year and

100
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,409
then go back and plant it looking at

101
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,090
maybe growing broccoli and cauliflower

102
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,729
and then back to your host crop

103
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,340
sometimes isn't an option of her some

104
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,069
growers but if it is this can be a way

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,209
to help try to reduce those numbers

106
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:56,129
biologically without adding any

107
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,259
pesticides or fumigants to the soil

108
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,359
because again these are animals and they

109
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,030
can those pesticides typically have a

110
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,250
lot of harmful effects to humans are in

111
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,050
the environment in general so it gives

112
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,120
you a little bit of that brief overview

113
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,580
of nematodes and hopefully it's to

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,830
understand a little bit more about these

115
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,180
animals now they can impact plants but

116
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,250
also the fact that they can be

117
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,250
beneficial in some regards
