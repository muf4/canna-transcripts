1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,588
so looking at light wattages and

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,569
voltages is important we've ever been

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,699
looking at lighting I might see things

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,849
they're offering in different voltages

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:14,279
and you know and maybe you got the wrong

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,870
one shipped to you also wattages might

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,028
be wondering what that is wouldn't help

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,439
explain that a little bit here so we're

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,300
talking about what it is in this case

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,000
and volts I think these are the same

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,800
volts in the same 120 volts or this one

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,809
has a crowning plug has nothing to do

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,460
with the waters or the volts but is

14
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,308
advised that you buy something that does

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,660
have the grounding plug attached to it

16
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:34,800
so first off Watts this might be what

17
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,449
you're most familiar with if you're at

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,189
to change light bulbs because it's the

19
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,410
amount of energy it takes to produce a

20
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,839
certain amount of light so these are you

21
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,459
know 60 watt light bulbs indicated here

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,350
the higher the wattage the more power

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,200
the fixture uses and ideally the

24
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,939
brighter the light it will produce this

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,620
preferred white is so for full sized

26
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,689
vegetative plants and flowering plants

27
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,968
focus on four six hundred or thousand

28
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,409
watt lights most growers are focusing on

29
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,329
the six hundred of the thousand watts of

30
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,799
particular anythings small and this is

31
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,530
not gonna allow for maximum yields it's

32
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,908
better used for clones or seedlings

33
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,700
thousand watt bulbs we see here this

34
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,170
could be the pro 1000 double-ended watt

35
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,960
bulbs are considered to be the stands

36
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,400
for North America by most growers other

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,039
person world or other growers will use

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,659
600 as kind of their standards typically

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,479
we're seeing the thousand Watts being

40
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,830
the general standard here now the other

41
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:24,750
terms for my be familiar with in the

42
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,140
sense of electricity this diagram shows

43
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,780
a perfect example we have amps which is

44
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,430
the amount of charge or current flowing

45
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,739
through the circuit over a period of

46
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,659
time we have the volts which is like the

47
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,789
pressure in line causing the current to

48
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,219
flow through the wire it's the push and

49
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,780
we have ohms of measurement indicating

50
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,670
the amount resistance applied to a

51
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,530
current so we want to keep the ohms as

52
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,750
small as possible because we don't want

53
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,430
to restrict this flow this is kind of

54
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,399
what caused excessive heating and

55
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,100
potentially lead to fire now we might

56
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,829
hear 120 volt system versa to turn a 40

57
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,319
volt system all the plugs do look vastly

58
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,809
different it's more than that then just

59
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,758
what the outer plug is 120 volts with

60
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,990
most appliances run on so if you have

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,030
something requires a high amount of

62
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:12,930
energy such as a dryer let's up leaving

63
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,919
run on 220 or 240 volts Watts is equal

64
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,469
to volts times

65
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,208
amps so it's just an example here we're

66
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,959
looking at changing the volts and how it

67
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:26,699
relates to amps we have in this case a

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,890
1200 watt appliance or required motor or

69
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,079
a light or something to that nature so

70
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,989
we're keeping that the same however in

71
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,450
one case we're going to buy 120 volt

72
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,209
supporting light and application by 240

73
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:42,060
volt light well the 120 volts going to

74
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,069
draw 10 amps well the two Coreys only

75
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,610
going to draw 5 amps so what does this

76
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,079
mean

77
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,290
other than the outlets look differently

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,719
so the 240 volt requires less current or

79
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:54,509
amps and a smaller conductor can be used

80
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,300
smaller wire can be used which can be

81
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:58,979
advantageous the 240 is the world

82
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,010
standards while the United States still

83
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,299
use the 120 volt is its standard so then

84
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,729
keep in mind if in parts of the world

85
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,560
where that be located you could see why

86
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,199
in some cases the 240 volt is

87
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,569
advantageous so because of the less amps

88
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,799
requiring a smaller conductor that can

89
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,799
be used to transfer that energy
