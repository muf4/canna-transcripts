00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,359
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,679
well i'll be presenting the advantages

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:17,759
and disadvantages of some water sources

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:19,359
if you're looking at growing outdoors

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,279
all right let's get into water sources

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,118
for outdoor canvas production providing

7
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,118
with some examples and some advantages

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,879
and disadvantages of each

9
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,640
so first off water sources when it comes

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,839
to campus plants they do need water

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,760
when it comes to supplying them with

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,399
water from sources other than natural

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
rain

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,840
growers need to know how to maximize

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
their plants performance

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
with the water they have available and

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,759
many times growers may have

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,359
different water source options so which

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,399
one is quote the best or which one

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,238
should they choose

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,480
going to provide you with some advantage

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,159
and disadvantages of each

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,078
so first off pond water so if we're

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
looking at we have an irrigation pond

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,840
the advantages of irrigating from pond

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,119
water is that it's typically available

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,239
in large quantities

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,079
because we have to remember we're going

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,799
to need the water to irrigate the plants

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,878
the most

31
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,959
during times of drought however the

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,920
disadvantages are that it does

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,000
typically need a multi-filter system you

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
can't just throw a pump in here and pump

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
out of it

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,799
in most cases you typically need some

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,239
sort of multi-filter system to either

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
take particulate out

39
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,920
or to ensure you're not going to be

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
spreading any of the algae potentially

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
that may be growing in that

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
water as well then we get to city water

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,719
so the advantages of

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,840
city water is that or tap water may be

45
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,959
called also is that it's easy to get and

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
it typically requires

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,158
minimum modifications you can literally

48
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,560
just hook a hose up

49
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,840
go irrigate shouldn't be a problem there

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
however what of the disadvantages of

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,719
using city or tap water is that it can

52
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,719
be costly

53
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,319
compared to other sources mentioned here

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,640
and limited areas have this

55
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,679
as an option particularly if you're in

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,519
distant areas

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
or they may not be able to supply enough

58
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,359
water or at least justify the cost

59
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,919
for the volume of water that you may

60
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,640
need to water your plants

61
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
then there is also well water so well

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,879
water

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,680
is supply plants in very remote

64
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,599
locations

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
a lot of times you can potentially have

66
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,400
a well

67
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,399
dug or basically bored down and

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,480
irrigate water that might irrigate with

69
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
water at a location that might be very

70
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,359
distant

71
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,039
it's also a free water source and put

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
free in quotes there simply because

73
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,159
there is some costs associated with the

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
well itself

75
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,239
digging the well maybe running power to

76
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,318
the well getting that set up but as far

77
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
as the cost of the water itself

78
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,919
this case is basically free the

79
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,799
disadvantage of using well water is you

80
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,039
have to be

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,719
careful in dry years depending on how

82
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,000
deep that well is what its replenish

83
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,840
rate may be

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,680
also keep in mind that the water that

85
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,159
you're getting pumping up from the well

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,719
is often a cold temperature and this

87
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,878
might

88
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,560
slow down growth of plants because they

89
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,959
typically like warmer water

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,878
i want to check also the quality for

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,920
water but with well water in particular

92
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,919
you want to check the

93
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,439
temperature to make sure it's not too

94
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,119
cold especially in the early part of

95
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,439
germination and propagation

96
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,878
so you don't stunt the plants hopefully

97
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,318
this was a nice little review

98
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,158
of looking at the different options that

99
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,158
you might have for outdoor irrigation
