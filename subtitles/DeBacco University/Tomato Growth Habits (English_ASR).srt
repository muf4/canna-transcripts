1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
okay for going through some of the seed

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,830
catalogs you might see Tomatoes

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,169
organized by growth habits and what are

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,669
some of these terms mean well they all

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:13,349
look like they produce great tomatoes

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:15,000
but the growth habits is referring to

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,710
how the plant is going to be I mean

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,140
really tall it's going to be short and

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,670
squatty what's it gonna look like now

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,990
some of the terms you're gonna see are

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,449
what's called determinant semi

12
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,640
determinant in indeterminate now

13
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,220
determinant is just as the name implies

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,018
grows to a set height set determined

15
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,390
height they typically produce a harvest

16
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,369
in the compressed window typically over

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,620
about a month or sell Simmonds

18
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,869
determinate varieties grow taller than

19
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,509
they're in determinants but not quite as

20
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:45,149
tall as the in determines these semi

21
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,099
germans usually requires taking in

22
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,170
determines grow forever theoretically

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,170
speaking at least they typically yield

24
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,640
over a longer period of time so want to

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,320
be thinking about these different growth

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,049
habits and how they may fit your

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,149
operation now determines are more common

28
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,280
in tunnel growing conditions where

29
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,409
there's a limited final plant height

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,989
they're determined they're a set height

31
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,090
if you have a certain sort of roofing

32
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,039
areas or cover you may want a

33
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,159
determinant variety might fit that

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,560
situation better semi determines try to

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,359
provide the best of both worlds they

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,850
kind of give a range here

37
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,769
they top out at a greater height then

38
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,199
determines and can fit covered

39
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,390
operations will not limit the yields as

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
the height matches the typical growing

41
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,618
season they're trying to grow that plant

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,629
to the point it's gonna reach the top

43
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,750
when it reaches the top ideally the

44
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,969
growing season will be over in

45
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,489
determines will grow all season and can

46
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,810
reduce a continual harvest they can get

47
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,759
wild and out of control they're not

48
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,740
pruned and they can grow bases

49
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,359
throughout the year but this stake

50
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,429
height that you you should be considered

51
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,560
is an example here an extreme example of

52
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,840
a indeterminate variety growing and

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,189
taking up a whole large area the in

54
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,570
determine scene kind of think of them as

55
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:59,758
like Jack and the Beanstalk where they

56
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,819
will continue to grow some people will

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,950
grow them up a staking and then allow

58
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,319
them to grow back down to the soil

59
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,640
surface so again these are just the

60
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,439
different types of growth habits to

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,738
consider when selecting your tomato

62
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,739
seeds
