1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay so here we'll look at grow nutrient

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,750
formulations typically you'll see

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,780
companies market the word grow on their

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,388
fertilizers and at least four have and

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,459
what that kind of equates to is a larger

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,618
amount or percentage of nitrogen that

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,630
they contain keep in mind it's nitrogen

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:22,320
phosphorus potassium this is a twelve

9
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:24,149
six six the six three three a seven nine

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,420
five and so on and so forth there's no

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,948
set fertilizer ratio typically grow

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,920
nutrients will simply just have more

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,600
nitrogen so this is containing more

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,309
nitrogen the goal is to produce a

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,350
greater plant growth more leaf growth

16
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,628
more top growth you might know if you

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,100
are planning on cloning the plant you

18
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,359
may want to watch how much nitrogen you

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,520
feed your plants because that can

20
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,829
potentially negatively impact your

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,379
ability to clone that mother plant going

22
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,210
forward now that nitrogen I mentioned

23
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,948
this nutrient is very quick at things so

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,320
it's better to focus on feeding just

25
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,858
enough because it's easy to over feed

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,628
with this nutrient if you are six

27
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,059
suspecting a nitrogen deficiency as some

28
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:04,679
nitrogen-based fertilizer water it in so

29
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,590
it gets to the root zone wait about

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,700
three to four days if you see a change

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,219
in the plant response and it was

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,478
nitrogen if you don't then move on to

33
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,548
something else don't keep adding

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,759
nitrogen it also comes in different

35
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,280
forms we have urea here calcium nitrate

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,469
and blood meal all kind of ways of

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,280
delivering nitrogen very different

38
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:28,408
amounts this is 13% and this one is 46%

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,159
nitrogen so that will adjust the amounts

40
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,270
that you do add to your plants

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,090
remember that growth formulations may

42
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,578
have higher nitrogen number but there's

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,710
other nutrients to consider phosphorus

44
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,029
and potassium do not simply apply for

45
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,009
the nitrogen and ignore the other

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,930
nutrients that you're adding this must

47
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,299
be taken into consideration as you plan

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,759
your long term grow cycle so for example

49
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,920
this nutrient here says grow we think

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,469
it's high nitrogen it is contains 7

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,478
percent but 4 percent phosphorus in 10

52
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,269
percent potassium so if you're just

53
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,459
focusing on the nitrogen here you could

54
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,289
be over adding on the potassium end of

55
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,078
things so this is where I got a look at

56
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,270
the entire nutrient blend and applying

57
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,068
it kind of as part of an entire program

58
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,580
for the growth cycle and not just

59
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,989
focusing on one particular nutrient

60
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,240
vilasa is called flushing the media

61
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,370
where plants may involve adding water

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,930
just like the total toilet bowl here

63
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,280
where you're flushing with about three

64
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,110
times the volume of the media to help

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,090
remove excessive salts in nutrient

66
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,830
buildup that may have occurred however

67
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,479
this is in part we're careful additions

68
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,790
are important you want to kind of

69
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,530
selectively add your nutrients there's a

70
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,780
help reduce the chance of building up a

71
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,209
set excessive salts which can damage the

72
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,349
root system reduce it your need to flush

73
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,729
the plants when you're flushing the

74
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,340
plants here you're kind of potentially

75
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,750
wasting out some nutrients so if you

76
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,219
kind of want to be very careful on your

77
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,289
feeding program throughout the entire

78
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,180
grow cycle so you're at sufficient as

79
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,179
possible in minimizing waste
