1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
now when people say growing cannabis a

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,160
lot of people think of the plant the

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,120
soil

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,480
the water the fertilizer the substrate

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,559
lighting and all of that

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,679
however we also particularly for indoor

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,959
growing need to be

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,879
aware of the importance of of hvac jobs

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,719
so this debacle university video is

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,679
going to cover the importance and some

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,599
of the details

12
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,879
associated with an hvac job if you're

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,910
considering that and

14
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:34,000
merging that with the cannabis industry

15
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,679
[Music]

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,280
all right let's get into hvac jobs in

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,000
the cannabis industry

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
so first off the general job description

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,280
is that it performed

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,558
skills mechanical maintenance duties in

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,439
the inspection repair

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,718
installation and alteration of heating

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,558
ventilation

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,079
air conditioning and refrigeration

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,919
systems and related equipment

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,000
and facilities perform preventative

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,640
maintenance and routine servicing

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,238
of that equipment so there's a lot there

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
but for indoor facilities where you're

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,519
really creating a specialized indoor

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,478
growing environment

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
this is a very important job because

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,118
we're trying to maintain those

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,118
consistent conditions

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,920
as a result made to heat one day cool

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,400
another day add humidity reduce humidity

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
there's a lot going on here now the

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,280
day-to-day activities of someone

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,118
specializing in hvac and

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,840
kind of in the cannabis industry is

41
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,759
inspect repair modify hvac equipment

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,359
that's your heating ventilation air

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
conditioning equipment

44
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,280
that can be referred to condensers and

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,640
chillers and pumps

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,439
valves so there's a lot going on even in

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,359
a small

48
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,118
cannabis growing facility you want to

49
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,560
conduct regular preventive maintenance

50
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,560
inspections that could be changing

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
filters out for example

52
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,560
inspecting units as far as boilers go or

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
gas or electric operated air

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,719
conditioning systems

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,719
as well as evaporative coolers the goal

56
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,519
the hvac person is to repair

57
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,200
or replace defective parts indoor units

58
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,200
and equipment in their controls and that

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,680
can be thermostats

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
fan controls heat exchangers safety

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
valves

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
and a whole bunch of other things as

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,719
well they operate a variety of hand

64
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,799
and power tools welding torch vacuum

65
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,959
pump testing equipment

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
to ensure that all the parts and tools

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,598
inventory is present

68
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,958
and working properly now what are some

69
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:19,598
qualities if you're looking at pursuing

70
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,759
this as

71
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,199
a potential career well work is

72
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,759
performed while standing sitting or

73
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,238
walking

74
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,919
so being physically fit is important

75
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,120
also requires the ability to communicate

76
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,439
effectively in speech

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
vision as well as hearing requires use

78
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,560
of hands and simple grasping of fine

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,318
manipulations

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,759
requires bending squatting crawling

81
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:38,000
climbing and reaching so there's a lot

82
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,479
of

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
physical um labor involved here

84
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,679
installing all this not always not in

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
the easiest part of to be on your side

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,439
through things like that

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,759
requires ability to lift carry push or

88
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,000
pull medium weights up to 75 pounds

89
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,318
aquarius activities involve being around

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
moving machinery exposure to mark

91
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,479
changes in temperature and humidity

92
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
exposure to dust fumes as well as gases

93
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,518
typically high school diploma or gd

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,200
certificate is required

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,439
two years documentation of hvac

96
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,280
journeyman level operation maintenance

97
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,719
and repair experience in the hvac and

98
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
refrigeration trade is

99
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,519
also highly sought after so what's the

100
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
connection to the cannabis industry

101
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,158
well the cannabis industry is widely

102
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,560
considered to be the fastest growing

103
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,759
industry and heavily reliant on hvac

104
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,519
technicians

105
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,719
typically hvac techs will have little to

106
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
no knowledge of what it takes to grow

107
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,000
cannabis

108
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,919
and that can be perfectly fine there is

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,439
a need for technicians who specialize in

110
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,039
various areas of hvac

111
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,039
but understand the needs to create a

112
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,120
healthy cannabis growing environment

113
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,639
which creates a new area of study in the

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,239
hvac canada space

115
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,479
and if you do have some sort of

116
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,439
background in plants having the hvac

117
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,598
background as well

118
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,799
can really make you a potentially a

119
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,839
highly sought after

120
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
future employee
