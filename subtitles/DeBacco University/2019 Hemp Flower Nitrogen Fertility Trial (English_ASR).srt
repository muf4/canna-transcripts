1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
many growers rightfully ask how much

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,960
nitrogen should i fertilize my hemp

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,439
plants with

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:16,559
and this trial will hopefully answer

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,640
that question

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,599
so here on tobacco university i'm going

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,480
to provide you

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,439
a summary of the 2019 hemp flower

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
nitrogen

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,480
for fertility trial hope you enjoy it

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,079
and

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,240
hope it answers a lot of questions for

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,799
you now first off where did i get this

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,399
information well from uvm this is

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,238
up in vermont extension service

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
they provided a great trial and

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,078
hopefully here you can see

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,600
the source if you want to find out more

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
information from the vermont extension

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,399
service

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,719
this kind of gives you an idea and they

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
were looking at evaluating the impact of

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,039
five different nitrogen application

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,198
rates

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,280
on the growth habit yield flower quality

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,439
and whole plant nutrition concentration

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,719
of hemp we'll provide you with a summary

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,079
here

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,040
so first off how much nitrogen well grow

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,960
growth many crops need to fertilize each

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
year with nitrogen to help ensure plant

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,000
growth over the season

33
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,760
over adding can lead to potential

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,959
negative environmental impacts and

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,200
unnecessary increased

36
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,319
cost to the grower nitrogen can be

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,478
variable in the soil

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,359
so there is a june nitrate test which

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,400
can help provide an

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,079
idea of what it is in specific fields so

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
that's great for growers to know

42
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,359
and to utilize and take advantage of

43
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,359
that particular test

44
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,799
however what is the target for cannabis

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,959
how does it respond

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
compared to traditional nitrogen

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,599
application rates

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,759
and this kind of trial helped answer

49
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,399
some of those questions so what was the

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,159
design

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
of the trial that's important with any

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
kind of trial you're looking at

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
well tribal is initiated in a broader

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
view research farm

55
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,719
up in vermont that's in the northern

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,399
part of vermont and the experimental

57
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,478
design was a randomized complete block

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,439
design with four replications

59
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,879
plots consisted of five plants spaced

60
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,039
five feet apart in a row

61
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,798
and a plot treatments consisted of five

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,759
nitrogen application rates

63
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,520
listed in pounds of nitrogen per acre

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,239
including a control which was zero

65
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,719
pounds

66
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,079
75 pounds 100 pounds 125 pounds and 150

67
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,759
pounds of nitrogen

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,200
per acre so what was the fertility rates

69
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,840
here that we can see

70
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,958
well the plots within the individual

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
trials here

72
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
receive nitrogen fertility in split

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,520
applications over an eight week period

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,039
starting on the 28th of june in the form

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,159
of ammonium nitrate

76
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,079
plus sulfur iron 2800

77
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,239
applied directly to individual plants as

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,480
we can see here in table three weekly

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
hemp nitrogen fertility rates

80
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,878
we see the application rate we see the

81
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,598
up in gallons per acre

82
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,959
we see the weekly application rate here

83
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,159
in gallons breaker and then in

84
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,598
milliliters

85
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,120
per plant here and the treatments are

86
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,280
zero of course they're across the board

87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,000
75 pounds of the acre 100 pounds acre

88
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,719
125 pounds of the acre and 150 pounds of

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
the acre

90
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,318
this also gives growers a great way to

91
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,759
convert the stated typically that

92
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:02,958
they'll find pounds of the acre

93
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,598
to something might be a little bit

94
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,120
smaller for their operation

95
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,039
now what about other nutrients well

96
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
based on the soil test results

97
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,639
no further nutrients were required for

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
production of hemp this is kind of an

99
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,039
example here of the results

100
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,079
and everything was pretty much within

101
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,919
the optimum range

102
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,319
or excessive as we see here with

103
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,439
phosphorus and potassium

104
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,759
so it was determined that we could

105
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,959
really just look at the nitrogen here

106
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,959
and not worry about any of the other

107
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,759
nutrients

108
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,959
so transplanting and cover cropping so

109
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,759
the four week old hemp

110
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,439
seedlings were transplanted on june 19th

111
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,039
into a seed bed prepared with

112
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,959
conventional tillage

113
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,719
a cover crop mixture of tillage radish

114
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,360
and annual rye grass was planted between

115
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,439
rose

116
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,080
on the 26th of june so it gives you a

117
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,000
little background here of the conditions

118
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,000
now for irrigation irrigation was

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,919
applied a weekly basis at a rate of 8

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,479
000 gallons of water per acre

121
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,199
delivered via drip tape no irrigation

122
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,759
duration

123
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,438
and amount was modified based on weekly

124
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,079
rainfall this wasn't just a guaranteed

125
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,639
amount

126
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,640
based on the natural rain that occurred

127
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,759
adjustments were made

128
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,878
now pre-harvest each plot flower samples

129
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,120
were taken from the top

130
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,518
eight inches of colas and sent to be

131
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
analyzed for cannabinoid and terpene

132
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,918
profiles

133
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,759
the plant harvest process on october

134
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,000
21st all plants were harvested

135
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
and broken down the flower buds were

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
dried at 80 degrees fahrenheit or

137
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
ambient temperature with airflow until

138
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,319
dry

139
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,279
enough for storage without the risk of

140
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,360
molding

141
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,079
a subsample of the flower bud from each

142
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
plot was dried in a small dehydrator

143
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,599
and wet weights and dry weights were

144
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
recorded in order to calculate the

145
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
percent moisture

146
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,240
of the flower buds the percent moisture

147
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,719
at harvest was

148
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,319
used to calculate the dry matter yield

149
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
after middle

150
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,159
three plants were harvested and measured

151
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,399
and collected the remaining two plants

152
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,840
were harvested on october 28th and

153
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
shipped to be analyzed for whole plant

154
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,039
nutrition

155
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
concentrations now keep in mind that

156
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,000
were those five plants so they kind of

157
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
looked at the middle three

158
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and then they went back and took the end

159
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
two there so again just kind of

160
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
understand the parameters of this

161
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,599
particular trial

162
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,680
now growing season weather is outdoor

163
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,439
growing weather is always important

164
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,519
july was simply hot and dry compared to

165
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,120
the 30-year average august and september

166
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,038
were slightly cooler than normal

167
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,879
october had warmer above average

168
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,839
temperature and precipitation

169
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,360
and shows that they accumulated 2 211

170
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,679
growing degree days

171
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,038
which is about 197 more than the

172
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
historical average

173
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,800
many of these due to the mid season heat

174
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,638
hemp plants receive supplemental

175
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,600
irrigation to account for precipitation

176
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,439
deficits

177
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,280
although the growing season throughout

178
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,879
the growing season as needed

179
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,119
and again here's your temp here's the

180
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,279
weather data here just give an idea

181
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
of how it was compared to quote a normal

182
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,959
year

183
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,319
the plant height and the plant weight

184
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,638
well plants uh

185
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,560
height did not significantly differ

186
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,160
between nitrogen application rates here

187
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,759
shown in table five

188
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
whole plant weight was highest when

189
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,160
grown in 75 pounds nitrogen to the acre

190
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,759
125 and 150 pounds the acre rates

191
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
so see that comparison here looking at

192
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,360
plant height and then the whole

193
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
weight of the plant that's where we did

194
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,120
see some differences

195
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
now the flower bud in yield which is

196
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,478
what everyone usually goes to we're

197
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
looking at hemp flower

198
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,959
at harvest a composite sample of flower

199
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,199
material was collected from each plot

200
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,879
and then dried down this was used to

201
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,199
determine the flower dry matter

202
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,800
and calculate dry matter flower yields

203
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
there was no significant difference

204
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,199
among treatments for dry matter yields

205
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,360
or yields at eight percent moisture

206
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,600
whole plants receiving or while plants

207
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,120
receiving 150 pounds of nitrogen per

208
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
acre application rate

209
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,600
had the highest wet bud weight the dry

210
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,279
matter yields overall

211
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
but also had the highest amount of

212
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,279
unmarketable flower material at 78

213
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,598
pounds to the acre compared

214
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,879
to the next highest rate of 100 pounds

215
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,680
nitrogen to the acre

216
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,719
with only 9.1 pounds of the acre of

217
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,560
unmarketable

218
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,639
material so it's important i just look

219
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
at the total material produced

220
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
but also consider the amount that's

221
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
unmarketable because that's going to cut

222
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,079
into overall profits

223
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,919
unmarketable flour included any flour

224
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,359
that had suffered from disease

225
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,359
rot soil contamination or otherwise

226
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,879
damaged flower material so that's how

227
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
they were defining that unmarketable

228
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,560
flower

229
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,439
now for the cannabinoids note that only

230
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,280
one variety

231
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,038
and one source of fertilizer was tested

232
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,119
in this higher

233
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,038
rates nitrogen source and other

234
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
macronutrients or micronutrients

235
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,680
may have some impact on cannabinoid

236
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,079
profiles that was not expressed here

237
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
so again kind of a limited data set here

238
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,079
based on this trial

239
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,280
now for terping profiles we can see them

240
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,359
listed here

241
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,359
based on treatment for some of the

242
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,720
common terpenes all presented

243
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,400
in parts per million and see the kind of

244
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,160
the ones in bold here and we could see a

245
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,159
lot of variability amongst all the

246
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,560
nitrogen treatments there was no clear

247
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,639
winner here as far as terpene profiles

248
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,000
go so indicating here a little bit that

249
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,439
75

250
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,439
uh definitely looks like it had a little

251
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,319
bit more here but again not very

252
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,680
consistent

253
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,439
but at least we don't see a trend here

254
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,478
with 150 always produce the highest

255
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,680
terpene levels that

256
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,318
obviously here was not the case now the

257
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,840
results from that this 2019 trial is

258
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
that the hundred pounds of nitrogen per

259
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,959
acre rate

260
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,840
showed over one percent higher values

261
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,000
for cbd

262
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,279
compared to the next highest values and

263
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,519
results suggest

264
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,359
that nitrogen rates may have an impact

265
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,478
on cbd concentration

266
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,320
but not thc concentrations for this t2

267
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,038
cultivar that was studied

268
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,278
despite minor yet not statistically

269
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,278
significant differences in yields

270
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,519
flower quality differences in the form

271
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,240
of cannabinoids and terpenes were noted

272
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,159
with changes in nitrogen rates note that

273
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
the 100 pounds of the acre rate yield

274
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,240
the highest cbd percentage by weight

275
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,278
while this was not significantly

276
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,440
different than the 125 or 150 rates

277
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,360
this 75 pounds per acre rate had the

278
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,839
highest levels of terpenes

279
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
but the lowest cbd percentage so again

280
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
you have to look at what you're

281
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,759
ultimately going to be looking at for

282
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,759
harvest or marketable yield

283
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,879
now what's the general kind of end

284
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,200
result here what's the general

285
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,879
suggestion for canvas production

286
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,560
well looking at this data here

287
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,720
summarizing it and one kind of

288
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,119
quick slide here growers should be using

289
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
100 pounds per acre of nitrogen as the

290
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,159
target when it comes to cannabis

291
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,759
production

292
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,919
this will offer the best chance at a

293
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,080
quality yield with reduced chance of

294
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,838
negative environmental impacts

295
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,959
so again just adding more nitrogen is

296
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
not necessarily going to get you more

297
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,759
yield

298
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,799
targeting that 100 pounds to the acre of

299
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,958
nitrogen

300
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,919
would be recommended based on the

301
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,799
extensive

302
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,360
data and trial information presented

303
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,359
here
