1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,719
here we're going to look at some of the

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:07,340
specifics in regards to adding carbon

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,540
dioxide to a hydroponic grow set up

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,609
specifically carbon dioxide should not

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,678
be added to the water this can adjust

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,410
the pH we can affect nutrient

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,320
availability to the plants roots need to

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,000
respire so they need to actually consume

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,859
oxygen and they'll actually give off

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,850
carbon taxing themselves so we're

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,430
talking about carbon dioxide enrichment

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,320
for hydroponics it is not directly

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,649
relating to the aquatic or the water

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,450
nutrient based environment should be

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,850
added to the growing environment as this

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,430
can be beneficial not to the water again

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,350
with a great control over conditions of

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,049
the grower this is a possible to further

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,210
maximize plant productivity in addition

20
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,189
to the introduction of carbon dioxide

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,719
enrichment I want to make sure that our

22
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,250
nutrients are all lined out where they

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
need to be we're maintaining a good pH

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,628
temperature and EC a parts per million

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,128
why make sure also our lighting is

26
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:58,769
maximized we're getting a good part

27
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,119
level to the plants our timers and

28
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,550
everything is functioning properly both

29
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,349
for our hydroponic pumps and also our

30
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,329
lighting and also I put a picture here

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,949
for ventilation so if we're venting the

32
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,679
area we want to make sure we have a

33
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,990
properly matched sized fan for our grow

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,640
operation if we oversize the family

35
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,140
could be pulling out the carbon dioxide

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,009
that we're going to be carefully and

37
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,349
precisely adding to our operation so is

38
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,269
it worth it well in one word you yes if

39
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,349
you're maximizing other conditions so

40
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,390
keep in mind that if you're just going

41
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,039
to add co2 to get bigger yields that may

42
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,719
not be the case you've got to make sure

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
your lighting is maximized gotta make

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,840
sure nutrients are all dialed in

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,150
everything else is going well this is

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,000
one way to help increase or lift the

47
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,859
potential maximum yield tank system can

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,390
be used if you are using a generator

49
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:43,978
that produces Heat so keep that in mind

50
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,019
a lot of times with hydroponics there's

51
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,060
enough other pumps running that may also

52
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,950
generate heat Jenners will also produce

53
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,629
other gases as a byproducts this is

54
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,549
again can also increase the moisture

55
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,618
which may be something you do not want

56
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,020
to increase any more in a hydroponic

57
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,780
setup so at the end keep in mind that

58
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,158
come and I said is worth it don't add it

59
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,560
to the water and make sure you're

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,290
maximizing all your other conditions and

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,878
your venting system is not overly size

62
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,868
so you're not pulling out the vital

63
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,539
carbon dioxide

64
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,770
use a controller and at a timer and if

65
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,629
you should be able to

66
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,400
see some benefit with adding carbon

67
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:21,139
dioxide allowing your plans to more

68
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,140
efficiently produce sugars
