1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,359
here we're going to look at telomeres

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,000
which are shown here is the

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,160
end caps of chromosomes they're a nice

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
bright pink contrasting color here

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,280
they're kind of the glowing image here

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,519
in the black and white and they're

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,000
circled and zoomed in on the cartoon

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,559
image

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
up just above me now why are these

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,038
important why are we looking at them and

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,879
what are they

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,480
well it's important because these end

13
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,320
caps get shorter with each

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
cell division so here we see a cell

15
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,839
going through a series of divisions

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
you see the telomeres slowly being

17
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,640
degraded

18
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,039
you can kind of think of this as being

19
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
like the eraser on a pencil

20
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,320
the more times you're going to go

21
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,879
through and use it the shorter that they

22
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,719
get

23
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
an average cell will divide between 50

24
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
and 70 times before the cell ends up

25
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,640
dying

26
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,679
as each cell divides the tolerance at

27
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,719
the end get shorter and shorter

28
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,719
these kind of a theory or a limit on

29
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,759
how short the silvers can get through

30
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,920
each cell division

31
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,359
and eventually when they're too short no

32
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
longer present on the chromosome and

33
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,878
that cell has gone through enough

34
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,198
division steps and that cell will

35
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,158
naturally basically die

36
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,000
and be replaced hopefully by other cells

37
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
now we kind of have here

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,599
that showing that cartoon image of when

39
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,159
you're kind of young you have those

40
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,679
nice large end caps to get older we see

41
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,000
that kind of getting shorter

42
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,799
and sadly as we age it's getting even

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,719
shorter

44
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,720
um to the point here where it can only

45
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,319
divide so many times

46
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,400
basically gone that chromosome is

47
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,438
unprotected and that cell will go

48
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,240
through a natural death process

49
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,519
now the telomerase is a ribonuclear

50
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,280
protein it's an enzyme

51
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,719
what does that mean well we're looking

52
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,519
at protecting the ends

53
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,959
of the chromosomes or end caps and it

54
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,560
goes through the process that we call

55
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,000
reverse transcriptase

56
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,000
this forms dna from an rna template so

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
it's reverse transcriptase

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
we're forming dna from that rna template

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,720
we're going kind of

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,720
backwards it acts without that dna

61
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,000
template has its own rna template that's

62
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,000
stored inside

63
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,118
that's then used to kind of reverse

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,879
transcribe

65
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,759
a dna from that now the end result ends

66
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,599
up being that

67
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,040
this dna is extended each time it's

68
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,679
copied however

69
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,159
other mechanisms restore the length in

70
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,360
germ

71
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,439
cells so somatic cells as your

72
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
natural body cells germ cells remember

73
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,159
your sex cells

74
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,759
somatic cells do not have enough

75
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,680
termites to keep this process

76
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,759
going so they'll lose that terminal

77
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
length and this is thought to result in

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,120
that cell's

79
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,318
natural death process however many

80
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
cancer cells

81
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,560
have actually found ways or have

82
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,760
mechanisms to increase the length

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,680
of this telomerase or activity

84
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,598
this is causing them to become immortal

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,879
because if we slowly reduce the

86
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,839
telomerase um the telomeres of the

87
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,919
chromosome

88
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
and that cell ends up dying well cancer

89
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,719
cells simply just

90
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,480
increase the length kind of put like a

91
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,479
permanent cap over it

92
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,159
to keep its length consistent and

93
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,759
therefore resulting

94
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,519
can become immortal because they won't

95
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,079
go through this natural death

96
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,080
process
