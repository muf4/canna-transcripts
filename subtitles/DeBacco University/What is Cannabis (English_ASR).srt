1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,169
I think this title presents a question

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,200
that a lot of people have and that is

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,969
well what is cannabis so we're gonna

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,080
look at noon investigate look at the

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,309
background for what cannabis actually is

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,679
so first off what is the naming

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:19,169
bluejeans canvas is probably indigenous

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,509
to the wet habits of the Asiatic

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,449
continent here this is probably likely

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,340
where it was originated or grown I do

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,840
have a couple links here for some

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,910
sources if you want to go ahead and take

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,009
a look some of the information that I

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,308
have here try to put in a summary of

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,350
this so where'd Kim's cannabis originate

16
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,049
okay this has a long coexisted with

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,820
mankind which led to early domestication

18
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:46,078
of the plant it's shown up in a lot of

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,238
old records so it's been around human

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,109
interactions for a very long period of

21
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,089
time because price.when reason why it's

22
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,789
been around is its diverse amount of

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,120
uses so it could be used as textiles for

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,058
fibers such as hemp clothing or in this

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,429
case a handbag also a narcotic or

26
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,289
psychoactive compounds so it kind of

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,140
serves potentially two different

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,299
purposes now what's the difference

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,099
between cannabis hemp and marijuana so

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,950
this is a very kind of key and important

31
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,459
distinction here chemists the plant is

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,359
tall with a stiff upright stem divided

33
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:26,280
into serrated leaves and these

34
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,728
collateral hairs it's used to produce

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,939
hemp fiber and also a psychotropic drug

36
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,799
that specifically hemp so Tammis is kind

37
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,039
of a broad category that includes both

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,380
hemp and marijuana hemp specifically the

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,618
cameras plant grown for fiber or other

40
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,810
non psychoactive components typically as

41
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,478
a high medical value due to the CBD the

42
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,350
cannabinoid produced it needs to have

43
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:56,039
less than 0.3 percent THC to be

44
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:58,949
confederate classified as hemp now a

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,689
plant called marijuana will may look

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,939
very similar to hemp and almost

47
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:05,099
indistinguishable what defines it as

48
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:08,728
marijuana is a cannabis plant that is

49
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:11,789
high in THC and it's currently federally

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,860
legal so THC is that psychoactive

51
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:15,689
cannabinoid that gets you the

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,050
what's associated with cannabis or

53
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,609
marijuana is the high hemp is at less

54
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,370
than three point zero point three

55
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,720
percent THC and typically grown for its

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,280
fiber or its medicinal CBD value so hemp

57
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,740
and marijuana are both classified on

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,400
cannabis hemp is going to be by far our

59
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,110
focus here now current or modern

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,330
cannabis is represented by many

61
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,910
cultivars cultivated varieties that are

62
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,070
often unstable taxonomic foundations

63
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,560
they'll hear these names that for

64
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,489
example isn't called green crack all

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,810
this crazy names very unstable taxonomic

66
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:56,520
foundations the names are very variable

67
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,709
so it gets into how do we name cannabis

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,840
well an application of the taxon systems

69
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,610
in the genus cannabis together with

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,939
sativa and indica a distinction should

71
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,780
be avoided the sativa indica not really

72
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,879
a great correlation to the plant may

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,000
indicate the morphology of the plant but

74
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,650
doesn't go much beyond that the whole

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,599
goal here is kind of to use the

76
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,510
international code for a nomenclature

77
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,659
for cultivated plants or even aid the IC

78
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:28,829
and CP and is not man Terry uses beats

79
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,659
to sit epithets so sativa or indica or a

80
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,640
combination of the genus name and

81
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,729
cultivar epithet in any language and

82
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,099
downed by single quotation marks so an

83
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:40,018
example would be cannabis and then in

84
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,810
single quotation marks would be the

85
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,409
cultivar that be used so this defines

86
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,250
the name of that cannabis cultivar

87
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,949
there's been literally hundreds of

88
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,590
cannabis cultivated varieties developed

89
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:55,289
and named by medical patients and also

90
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,019
recreational users the downfall to

91
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:59,819
utilizing or adopting this system is

92
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,879
that few of these have been treated as

93
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,319
the real cannabis cultivars and having

94
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,229
been regularly named and registered

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:12,000
according to the proper channels so the

96
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:14,159
name such as CR super Lemon bud that

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,589
green crack Skywalker or all kind of

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,959
just names used by recreational users

99
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,369
and really don't have any core meaning

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,680
as far as the proper way to name a plant

101
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,509
with a lack of a standard this is

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,009
causing a major issue but dick

103
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:31,349
with marijuana strains that lack an

104
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,699
adequate description for this reason

105
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,570
their names cannot be accepted as

106
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,219
cultivar the epithets so any strain that

107
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,500
has not been formally described as a

108
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,480
cultivar for example the so called Sour

109
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,079
Diesel should be named is file as

110
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,069
follows the cannabis strain Sour Diesel

111
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,379
with their popularized name without

112
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,420
single quotation marks having in mind

113
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,420
that their names have no Texan avakov

114
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:59,160
elyda t so just because Sour Diesel is

115
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,000
very common high THC form of cannabis on

116
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,189
the East Coast

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,129
really that names is kind of tossed

118
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,689
around and doesn't have that true

119
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,779
taxonomical background because there's

120
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,430
lack of a standard so see here a blood

121
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,829
of Sour Diesel here's above Argo

122
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,829
blackberry really these names are just

123
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:20,180
kind of out there and used but aren't

124
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:20,180
really scientifically backed
