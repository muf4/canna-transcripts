1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
okay I'm gonna give you a brief overview

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,810
of the digestive system this image here

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,970
shows a great summary of the organs

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:11,910
involved and also their orientation in

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,280
the body this image here gives you the

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,750
same orientation but gives you a little

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,519
bit more description for some of these

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,410
areas so it's important to have a

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,198
general sense of what's occurring where

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,560
and why what the necessary functions are

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,990
of some of these essential organs now

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,879
why do we consume food well consume food

13
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,709
to gain energy and a healthy diet

14
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,229
contains more carbohydrates than fats

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,120
it also contains lots of proteins you

16
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,128
may remember from macromolecules

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,399
carbohydrates are important for storage

18
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,189
of energy but also provide energy

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,899
quicker energy that can be that simple

20
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:47,549
monosaccharides into sugars proteins

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,920
make up much of the structure of cells

22
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,099
and also can speed up chemical reactions

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,379
in the form of enzymes lipids are for

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,689
long-term storage of energy here's the

25
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,789
food pyramid indicating items at the top

26
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:00,988
we should be consuming less of and at

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,910
the bottom we should be consuming more

28
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:04,948
of which you can see the foundation is

29
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,489
based in daily exercise in weight

30
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:10,259
control for a healthy lifestyle

31
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:12,989
continuing on oftentimes we hear in the

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,760
news about someone being obese or the

33
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,890
obesity epidemic and the percentage of

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,689
people being obese well how is that

35
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,239
determined it's determined through the

36
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:24,029
body mass index and that's abbreviated

37
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,759
BMI in short what it does is it compares

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,259
someone's weight to someone's height so

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,379
if you kind of get an idea where you may

40
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,618
fall for your BMI based on your weight

41
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:37,199
in pounds and your height here and again

42
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,009
both metrics in US customary are

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,420
provided here

44
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,290
so you're looking to pause the video and

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,329
see where you fall in this area

46
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:48,060
continuing on essential substances for

47
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,429
growth so we do consume food but we have

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,170
some essential substances for growth so

49
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,729
many vertebrates aren't enabled to

50
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,129
manufacture one or more of the twenty

51
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:58,530
amino acids needed to make proteins so

52
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,658
while there's only 20 total humans are

53
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,909
unable to synthesize eight of those

54
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,590
twenty there's a couple listed here

55
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,110
leucine lysine phenyl alanine valine are

56
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,140
essential because those must be obtained

57
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,470
through the food meaning our body cannot

58
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:19,199
factories in addition we cannot

59
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:22,229
synthesize certain polyunsaturated tats

60
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,599
and we also need to be consuming trace

61
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:27,299
elements so a trace element there's a

62
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,370
couple listed here they are required in

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,510
small amounts nothing that we need in

64
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,280
large amounts but they are essential so

65
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:37,259
iodine zinc manganese are just a couple

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,610
examples here of trace elements that are

67
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,469
important for our body to function

68
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,660
properly

69
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:44,340
lastly vitamins essential organic

70
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,409
substances required also in small

71
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,930
amounts in humans require at least 13

72
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:51,299
different vitamins vitamin C or absorb

73
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,189
ik acid if not obtained in the diet the

74
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,510
disease scurvy will develop so it just

75
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:57,629
gives you an idea of some of the

76
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,009
importance of some of these components

77
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,109
that are essential for growth

78
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,769
it may not be needing large amounts that

79
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,600
are needed at least in some way

80
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:08,759
continuing on our digestive system

81
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,919
function to acquire nutrients we have

82
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,429
the ability to break down substances

83
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,199
here hydrolysis catabolism here what's

84
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,390
happening here is large molecules are

85
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,859
being broken down into small ones water

86
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,649
is being consumed in this this is

87
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,170
releasing energy hydro lysis using water

88
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,989
to lyse or break apart molecules this

89
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,578
releases energy typically valves

90
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,569
oxidation reactions in glycolysis would

91
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,890
be an example so big in our complex

92
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,979
molecule here and breaking it down into

93
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,629
simpler ones now if there's a way to

94
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,699
break things apart so you put things

95
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,169
together anabolism here using raw

96
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,569
materials that synthesize essential

97
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,879
components dehydration synthesis is the

98
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,650
process here small molecules are some of

99
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,620
them to large ones and water is produced

100
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,659
dehydration water is being lost here he

101
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,829
uses energy to construct new bonds and

102
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,030
typically involves reduction reactions

103
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,370
putting it all together here cattle ISM

104
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,640
and of like reactions here here's our

105
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,280
glucose here we have our two different

106
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,738
pathways so just to remember we're

107
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,759
cattle catalyzing something here

108
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,108
we're breaking it apart and here we are

109
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,879
putting things together so if there's a

110
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,000
way to put things together there's also

111
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,108
a way to break things apart and here

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,930
we're seeing our carbohydrates or sugars

113
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,668
broken down to glucose glucose can be

114
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,550
assembled into starch

115
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:31,589
which is a complex glucose chain of

116
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,598
molecules see the same thing here that's

117
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:34,739
being broken down proteins being broken

118
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:37,468
down to amino acids

119
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,478
you see citric acid cycle you see fatty

120
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:41,848
acids being assembled into more complex

121
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,860
fats and phospholipids so as you can see

122
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:47,699
it's a very complex system that

123
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,870
everybody has to simplify a little bit

124
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,939
more there's mechanical and chemical

125
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,649
digestion mechanical and chemical

126
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,259
digestion of food takes place in many

127
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:58,138
steps being in the mouth and ending in

128
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,990
the rectum and this provides another

129
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,269
quick summary of where mechanical and

130
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,310
chemical digestion occurs in the

131
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,378
different regions of the body so good to

132
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,699
kind of review that and have an idea of

133
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:13,800
what's being broken down where in

134
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,840
digestion handles each nutrient

135
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,150
differently so there's not just one path

136
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,038
that we can run all nutrients through we

137
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:21,870
had in the max hydrolysis again taking

138
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,610
our more complex molecules and breaking

139
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,050
them down we see proteins into amino

140
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,908
acids carbohydrates and the

141
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,329
monosaccharides nucleic acid into

142
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:33,180
nucleobases lipids ultimately into fatty

143
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:35,240
acids they can be reabsorbed we see the

144
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,650
liver playing a very important role here

145
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,900
have their lymphatic system here with

146
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:42,989
blood fibre and cellulose being broke

147
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:45,448
down into T C's large molecules our

148
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,829
digestion before absorption occurs so we

149
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,689
need to break them apart before we can

150
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:50,250
absorb them in the body they can be

151
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,649
absorbed some can be absorbed without

152
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,478
processing but many require special

153
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:58,679
transport for this to occur in digestion

154
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,870
breaking the molecular bonds into large

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,490
organic molecules carbohydrates proteins

156
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,370
lipids and nucleic acids our main

157
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,769
macromolecules process called hydrolysis

158
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,579
it's divided into target classes so

159
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:15,060
looking here we see proteases amylase

160
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,310
nuclease lipase all of these are enzymes

161
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,528
breaking things down

162
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,870
nucleus breaks and nucleic acids amylase

163
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:23,968
breaks down starch or carbohydrate

164
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,250
protease breaks down proteins lipase

165
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:28,168
breaks down fats for lipids so we can

166
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,028
see an example also here of what's

167
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:32,158
occurring in the esophagus the stomach

168
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:34,468
the liver the pancreas in the small

169
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,509
