1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
okay we're gonna be looking at the

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,879
saturated media extract from soilless

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,460
media so I'd be wondering what this

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,199
exactly is the way you kind of think

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,410
about this is it's kind of like a soil

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:16,410
test for your soil less media so you

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,300
want to be taking your soilless media

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,250
and sending it to the lab and calling it

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,130
soil so you're not going to get really

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,500
that accurate or representative results

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,910
your soil less media because it contains

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,599
no soil needs to be treated differently

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,480
and the saturated media extract or SME

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,590
is the way to go to get accurate results

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,569
I've included a couple links down here

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,359
if you want some more information such

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,750
as from UConn soil testing lab and also

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:46,259
UMass again about this SME for soilless

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,450
media now this SMA is considered to be

20
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,909
the standard for testing the soilless

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,949
media and picture the pallets here kind

22
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,839
of that standard that gold standard it's

23
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:55,289
the one that is highly regarded in the

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,510
field

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,948
so this soilless media want to be

26
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,929
running to SME we don't want to be

27
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:02,159
sending this in as a soil sample again

28
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,109
because it's gonna use different

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,228
extraction fluids and not give us the

30
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,489
accurate results that you need

31
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:10,319
there's sample instructions so a little

32
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,209
different than that soil test if you

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,849
watch that lecture there I need to

34
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:18,478
provide a reputable and adequate sample

35
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,739
size for the lab the SMB through sample

36
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,810
directions independent fertilizer

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,089
regimen and method of production will

38
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,439
influence which we have so the pictures

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,390
of the legos here you don't wanted to

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,769
send them a bunch of random blocks gonna

41
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,109
have something that could mass together

42
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:34,978
and tell a good story or in this case

43
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:37,739
produced this Lego figure of Yoda to

44
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,450
tell a story of what your grow is going

45
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:41,158
to look like if you're kind of

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,079
haphazardly going through and sampling

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,399
and that really following the rules well

48
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:45,629
it's just like sending a bunch of blocks

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,790
you're not going to get some results

50
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,890
back is that really gonna help you you

51
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,320
send a quality sample and you can paint

52
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,019
a better picture of what's going on with

53
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,789
your plants the key is to be consistent

54
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,798
so birds need to be consistent with

55
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,810
their sampling and also consider the

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,259
following questions if comparing results

57
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,719
so if you take an example of a sample

58
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,859
early in the grow and it later I'm gonna

59
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,469
be able to compare those results

60
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,389
accurately you need to consider the age

61
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,620
or the stage of development of the plant

62
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,268
what the growing

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,370
you're using what's the fertilizer

64
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,989
program is there so release fertilizer

65
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,019
mixed in is there a plant problem going

66
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,539
on all of these factor into trying to be

67
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,269
consistent the sample you give the lab

68
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,280
and also allowing comparisons to be able

69
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,049
to occur if you're looking at the same

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,658
grow cycle and also the consider these

71
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:36,390
if you're comparing different grow

72
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:39,780
cycles or different plants on different

73
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,609
age groups lastly this SME procedure

74
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,169
what they do in the lab then what do you

75
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,000
think I miss the whole procedure here

76
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:47,219
they simply make a paste like tooth

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,139
paste here with soil and water and they

78
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,090
take the liquid portion which is the

79
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,858
extract they separate it from the solid

80
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,739
portion for pH disciple salts and

81
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:57,329
nutrient analysis so the procedure can

82
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,099
be very similar to a soil test but

83
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,650
exactly the details of how they go about

84
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:04,738
this is slightly different and therefore

85
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,739
you should be targeting the test in the

86
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,090
lab that matches the type of sample that

87
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,370
you're sending them so you get

88
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,590
representative results back so that

89
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,590
you're able to make informed decisions
