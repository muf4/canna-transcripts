1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,479
thank you for attending another debaco

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,559
university video

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,839
in this video we'll be looking at

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,519
cannabis compounds

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,280
kind of a general introduction to the

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,160
three main classifications

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,039
of compounds that cannabis can produce

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,278
so the first

9
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,399
major category here would be

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,640
cannabinoids

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,038
this is the word cannabinoid refers to

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,118
every chemical substance regardless of

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,960
structure or origin that joins with

14
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,719
cannabinoid receptors in the body

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,480
and the brain so while this is thought

16
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,960
of to be cannabis exclusive

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
it's actually not two cannabinoids that

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,239
are produced in high amounts though

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,558
in cannabis would be thc and cbd and

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,039
these are chemical compounds secreted by

21
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,199
the

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,439
cannabis flowers that provide relief to

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,920
array of symptoms including pain nausea

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,718
anxiety as well as inflammation

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
thc has that strong psychoactive effect

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
meaning it makes a person high that

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,640
euphoric

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,239
and we see the chemical structure

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
located up in

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,038
this direction over here and then the

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,959
cbd down a little bit lower over on

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,079
this side is thought to have

33
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,320
anti-psychoactive effect that controls

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,920
or moderates the psychoactive high

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,839
caused by thc and anxiety it's also been

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,719
shown to have some potential medical

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,478
benefits

38
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,158
when we're looking at reducing seizures

39
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,599
just as one example

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
you can notice their chemical structures

41
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,280
are very similar so just be mindful that

42
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,199
small changes

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
in chemical structure can have profound

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
effects and we're seeing

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,079
most know everything the difference

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,798
between uh thc

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,959
and cbd located right here with the

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
bonds located in this region

49
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,438
then we also have something called

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,439
terpenes so terpenes are aromatic oils

51
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,438
that color cannabis varieties with

52
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,919
distinctive flavors like citrus berry

53
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,000
mint pine plants produce terpenes

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
naturally to repel predators and also

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
attract pollinators so again not unique

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,959
to cannabis

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
but definitely notice as you hear a lot

58
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,199
of people talk about

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,118
terpene profiles regarding a cannabis

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
flower or end product

61
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,718
the plant stripping profile can be

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,320
influenced though by many factors that

63
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,319
can be climate weather

64
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,000
the age of the plant maturation the

65
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,799
fertilizers the soil type

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
the time of day and also the season so

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
those can all

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
impact the terpene profile that a plant

69
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,039
may have

70
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,839
lastly we have flavonoids here and these

71
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,280
are a class of plant secondary

72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,159
metabolites that have a polyphenic

73
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,080
structure

74
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,759
widely found in fruits vegetables and

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
certain beverages as well

76
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,439
flavonoids are responsible for the color

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
and aroma flowers and in fruits attract

78
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,560
pollinators

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,480
and sequentially fruit dispersion to

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
help in seed and sport

81
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,840
germination and the growth and

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
development of seedlings as well

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
flavonoids protect the plant from

84
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,839
different biotic and abiotic stresses

85
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,360
and act as unique uv filters you might

86
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,878
be associating that with maybe a

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
blueberry as it ripens

88
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,479
you can see there's different flavonoids

89
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,919
here as they go as they go through the

90
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,840
maturation process

91
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,518
some plants for example poison ivy will

92
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
produce kind of a reddish tone to their

93
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
leaves

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
and those are flavonoids to help protect

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,598
these young leaves from

96
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,199
the harsh uv light and they'll select

97
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,518
green up over time

98
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,318
so just a quick overview here of the

99
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,719
three main classifications of compounds

100
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,719
produced by the cannabis plant
