1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay human goers some basics of soil and

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,628
wellness you may think this is an area

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:08,759
where kind of worms live keep in mind

4
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:11,910
that there is an organic mineral matter

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,080
that composes 75% typically five percent

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,079
organic matter which contains

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,028
microorganisms and macro organisms then

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,618
50 percent of it is actually defined as

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:24,210
air and water this is what makes up soil

10
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:26,129
so again what is soil well it's mineral

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,599
based material that also contains air

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:29,250
water inorganic matter

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
times people I think it hung upon the

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,719
organic matter keep in mind air and

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,250
water are also a vital components

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,259
they're good for growing plant

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,869
conditions 25 percent air 25 percent

18
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,280
water 50 percent solid compacted soil

19
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,429
this is where we're kind of squeezing

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,620
out some of that air still retaining 25

21
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:49,469
percent water but increasing that solid

22
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:52,169
percentage poorly drained soils we also

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,300
have that 5 percent air they've

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,309
increased that water amount quite a bit

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,599
so while the salad is still 50 percent

26
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,038
here that matches the good growing

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,570
conditions in this case we have an

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
excessive amount of water

29
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,090
suffocating those roots reducing plant

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,079
performance a particle size so the size

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,060
of particles determines the

32
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,158
classification to the impact and open

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,930
space between those particles most soils

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,479
are a mixture of different particle

35
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,939
sizes Clay's defined as less than point

36
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,099
zero zero two millimeters it's the

37
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,429
smallest of the particles gravels told

38
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,140
artists to mills - about 75 millimetres

39
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,280
sand and silt and clay are going to be

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,879
the three we're going to kind of focus

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,368
on here

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,519
silt is that point zero zero two so I'm

43
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:34,859
basically clay up to 0.05 millimeters

44
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,719
and sand would be larger that 105 to

45
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,250
about that two millimeters could see

46
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,289
just in comparison well we may think of

47
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,009
sand particles being very small it is

48
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,810
clay there's actually the smallest again

49
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,478
how do those look well we have clay

50
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,640
soils sandy soils we have baloney soils

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,399
here so clay being comprised of those

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,780
smallest particles and then alone kind

53
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,599
of being in the middle and sand being

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,489
the largest well clay soils contain the

55
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,578
small so particles they have a tendency

56
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,048
to pack together reducing air spaces

57
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:06,599
greatest amount of surface area and have

58
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,459
a great impact on soil properties this

59
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,318
soil will crack when dry and tendency to

60
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,259
stick to equipment and if you've ever

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,829
worked with clay like a pottery class it

62
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,019
has a very

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,810
a similar consistency in extreme cases

64
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,270
to something like that and kind of see

65
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,920
here were we having that stickiness

66
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,610
appearance here that sheeting that

67
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:29,399
occurs this would be very indicative of

68
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,850
a clay or very very small particle based

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,340
in soil field test to determine clay I

70
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,259
simply take a sample of the soil in your

71
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,030
hand at little water and try to form a

72
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,399
ball as we see here and then attempt to

73
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,229
squeeze the ball into a flat ribbon the

74
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,060
ribbon reaches about two inches long or

75
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,949
more before breaking this is a sign you

76
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,300
have clay soil because those small

77
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,449
particles are able to hold themselves

78
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,340
together and this is kind of one quick

79
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,349
way you're not a 100 percent accurate

80
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,629
way we could play to give you an idea of

81
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:00,750
does that soil contain a lot of clay

82
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,699
based particles sandy soils there's a

83
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,379
largest of the soil particles it's very

84
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,539
easy to cultivate and sand however they

85
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,819
tend to dry out quickly it can be easily

86
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,519
flushed in nutrients so while they can

87
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,500
support plants because of their large

88
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,810
particle size typically water can drain

89
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,310
through them in soak in nutrients so

90
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,840
there's white if you don't see a lot of

91
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,229
plants being grown in desert regions

92
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,330
where it's all sand simply because of

93
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:27,810
the low rainfall and the tendency for

94
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,239
this soil to dry out anyway loamy soil

95
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,610
that's a combination of particles about

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,550
equal parts which is about 40% of sand

97
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,620
40% of silt offers many properties that

98
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,750
supports plant growth it can hold

99
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,000
nutrients which is great while still on

100
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,949
water to percolate through and air to

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,830
infiltrate which is great however

102
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,109
there's a large range of lonely soils

103
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,200
kind of see three different subsurface

104
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,750
areas of loam here the dark brown is the

105
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,780
fine kind of sandy loam subsurface layer

106
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,840
is kind of this pale brown is I guess

107
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,479
it's kind of also along those sandy loam

108
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,129
lines and the red clay is a red clay

109
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,199
loam so you kind of see some variability

110
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:11,009
that does occur but in general loamy

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,839
soils do favor crop development the soil

112
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,699
triangle so it's important to try to be

113
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,259
able to read this just on an initial

114
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,449
kind of overview take you can see that

115
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,858
clay is a great influence but you'll

116
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,329
notice there's of course three sides of

117
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,359
this triangle but how we'd go about

118
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,550
reading that is if we had soil had 30%

119
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,620
clay and 30% scene

120
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,740
so we take that 30% line go over here

121
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:37,658
see where intersects our 30% line right

122
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:39,158
here so 30 and 30 here and 34 33 60 40%

123
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:41,379
would have to be still to see this line

124
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:43,360
it comes down here all three intersect

125
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:46,840
right at this point here indicating that

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,479
soil would be a clay loam so again you

127
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,239
take your three percentages of clay silt

128
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:55,060
sand sand and wherever those intersect

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,620
would give you the soil type and you'll

130
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,810
notice that clay again because it's

131
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,360
small particles high surface area has a

132
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,199
great influence on the type of soil may

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,629
be classified as sand very difficult be

134
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,250
considered a fully ZN soil and you can

135
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:12,029
see those lonely soils are kind of here

136
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,288
there's a true loam clay loam sandy loam

137
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:16,658
sandy clay loam all these different

138
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:19,060
forms of classification but you can see

139
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:22,718
how I can kind of eat this soil triangle

140
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,908
a lot so you don't want to use soil if

141
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:26,168
you're growing in containers you want to

142
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,089
go out and dig a bunch of soil put it

143
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:30,279
containers and go grow in it this isn't

144
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:32,679
advised it's often heavy in mineral base

145
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,809
which can lead to issues utilized in

146
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,759
indoor operations the water holding

147
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,918
properties are not conducive to

148
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,960
container growing outdoors oil is great

149
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:42,939
for outdoor operations just because

150
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,348
plants may grow good outdoors doesn't

151
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,509
mean that will translate into the high

152
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:48,930
stress environment of indoor container

153
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,930
garden
