1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
so here we're gonna talk about the

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,929
basics of proteins now the reason why I

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,120
don't have a static image here but one

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,129
that is rotating is three-dimensional

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,678
shape is very important to the functions

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,269
of proteins as we'll see here that's

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,990
important to be able to view this

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,300
protein from all sides so proteins are

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:24,028
composed of amino acids so there's

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,278
different subunits that are linked

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,490
together that'll ultimately form the

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,559
protein so there's 20 common amino acids

13
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,420
in the standard genetic code and they

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,699
all have different side chains or R

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,350
groups this is the variant group and

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,079
they determine the properties of the

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,730
amino acid how will interact now in

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
additional to amino acids can be

19
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:47,128
incorporated by special translocation

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,649
translation and mechanisms so there's 22

21
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,259
genetically encoded amino acids but 20

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,929
are the common looking a little bit more

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,509
in more detail to this basic components

24
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,030
of an amino acid we have this basic

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,558
structure here so there is that our

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,960
group which is the variant group and

27
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,599
that's again what makes each amino acid

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,519
unique then there's the amino group the

29
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,438
hydrogen group in our carboxyl group so

30
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,959
the amino acid gets its name from the

31
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,079
amino group the amino hydrogen and

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,329
carboxyl group these are common in

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,069
standard across all amino acids what

34
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,509
makes them different is this R group

35
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,199
that provides them with a different

36
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,299
structure and also a different function

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,359
so we look at the amino acids here this

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,610
is a list of 21 of them and we could see

39
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,459
them kind of organized based on some of

40
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,750
their properties here so what are some

41
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,419
of those properties that an amino acid

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,040
may have well they could have a positive

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,769
side chain they've got a negative side

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,500
chain it could be you know acids with

45
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,868
polar uncharged size changes you could

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,328
see those organized here special cases

47
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:54,060
and then amino acids with hydrophobic

48
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:57,059
side chains here and they're each given

49
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,549
the name a three-letter kind of code and

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,269
then a single letter code so in

51
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,469
eukaryotes

52
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,938
there's only 21 amino acids but 20 of

53
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:09,389
those are the in the standard genetic

54
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,618
code plus there's one other one there

55
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,659
but we're going to focus really mainly

56
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,180
on those

57
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:16,939
t-there humans can listen to size 12

58
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,400
though of these amino acids which means

59
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:22,669
9 are considered essential and they must

60
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,400
be consumed in the diet humans cannot

61
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:27,500
manufacture or produce those particular

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,819
amino acids they need to be consumed in

63
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,129
the diet and that's why they're

64
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,870
considered to be essential ones that are

65
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,310
included here I just included the

66
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,590
capital letters here you can go through

67
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,640
and find it if you'd if you'd like just

68
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,610
to get you familiar with some of the

69
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:44,449
coding systems that we use for listing

70
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:47,120
amino acids now within our proteins here

71
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:48,409
we amino acids are linked together as I

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,110
mentioned before but they're linked

73
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:54,710
together by peptide bonds that is the

74
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,780
result of dehydration synthesis so what

75
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,310
is this kind of referred to in me well

76
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,520
if you're dehydrated you're losing water

77
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,900
well in this synthesis process there's

78
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,180
actually a water molecule that's

79
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,860
released I don't think by linking these

80
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,140
amino acids together there's going to be

81
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,400
leaders and leaders of water generated

82
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:14,059
there's just only one little water

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,099
molecule so keep in mind is that massive

84
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,159
amount of water but we are dehydrating

85
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,409
this process and releasing water so when

86
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,329
the bond is formed there's a release of

87
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,430
a water molecule now we could see that

88
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,080
here that's happening between our two

89
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,939
amino acids here amino acid one amino

90
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,110
acid two could also see the same thing

91
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,469
in the image over here

92
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:36,080
this peptide bond to form Oh H plus H is

93
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,280
H two O two hydrogen's and an oxygen and

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,020
we see the same thing here kind of

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,520
highlighted here where we have our two

96
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,040
hydrogen's and our oxygen forming that

97
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,140
water molecule when that's removed then

98
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,729
these are linking together here forming

99
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:50,779
this peptide bond between that carbon

100
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:52,849
and nitrogen atom now a dehydration

101
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,620
synthesis first hydrolysis if you

102
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:56,810
remember from one of the other lectures

103
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,830
or we'll be seeing hopefully in the

104
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,709
other lectures something called

105
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,630
hydrolysis so dehydration synthesis we

106
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,090
just talked about removing water to

107
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,439
linked molecules together so here a

108
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,090
bunch of molecules we're removing the

109
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,000
water molecule we're linking them

110
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,310
together hydrolysis is the opposite you

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,199
can think of break it apart as

112
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,810
hydrolysis water and lysis means to cut

113
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,060
or to break adding water to break bonds

114
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,310
so here we have a bunch of bonds here we

115
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,269
have water coming in breaking that apart

116
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,410
and getting now into our individual

117
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:30,448
kind of molecules or amino acids in this

118
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,699
case here enzymes are responsible says

119
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,978
break down a construction process more

120
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,639
on that later and other videos that you

121
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:40,579
can check out if you are interested

122
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,259
lastly our proteins would be called a

123
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:45,750
polypeptides what's a polypeptide well

124
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,069
it's a long chain of amino acids we kind

125
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,470
of see them here represent by their

126
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,720
three-letter code we have kind of one

127
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,470
two five six seven eight nine ten all

128
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,669
the way down here to 129 you see how

129
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,860
they're linked together and when we have

130
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:00,568
these long polypeptide chains sometimes

131
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,210
those one letter codes are advantageous

132
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:06,120
to make it easier to kind of read and go

133
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:08,818
through the polypeptide so poly meaning

134
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,860
many peptide referring to the bonds many

135
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,270
of those bonds linked together many of

136
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,610
those amino acids linked together by

137
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,609
those peptide bonds makes a protein
