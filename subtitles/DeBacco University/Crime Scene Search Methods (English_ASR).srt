1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
okay here in this debaco university

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,879
video we're gonna be looking at the

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
crime scene search methods we have a

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,080
couple pictured here

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,519
to give you a general idea of the

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,638
pattern you should be going through

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,880
but we're gonna look at this in a little

8
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,919
bit more detail so first off when

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
conducting a search

10
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,359
it's the whole point of conducting the

11
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,879
search is for evidence this must be

12
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,880
thorough and systematic

13
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,640
you do not want to make assumptions you

14
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,640
want to consider any permanent evidence

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,560
and do not overlook little details

16
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,560
because failure to do so can lead to

17
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,879
accusations and negligence or

18
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,000
covering up evidence so we don't want to

19
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,280
kind of like look up

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,039
up here we don't assume there's just

21
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
three because we look on kind of

22
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,399
the other side over here it looks like

23
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,600
there's four we want to be tried it

24
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,960
impartial but also

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,879
thorough systematic and detail oriented

26
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
now field evidence technicians are the

27
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,759
person responsible for conducting the

28
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,520
evidence search

29
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,839
they're mainly looking for fingerprints

30
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
footprints tool marks hairs fibers and

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
also possible trace evidence

32
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,280
carriers as well this should also be

33
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
photographed in the crime scene

34
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,558
documented because this is a really

35
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,960
important part

36
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,558
especially depending on the scene this

37
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,000
searching for evidence is

38
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,759
a critical part for any scene now before

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,438
the search can even begin before we even

40
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,079
get to that stage of looking for that

41
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,759
evidence

42
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,438
we want to ensure this scene is

43
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
controlled this

44
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,118
it also includes briefing all searchers

45
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
involved established

46
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,879
speed and areas of responsibility so

47
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
everyone kind of has a game plan going

48
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,079
in or hopefully a limited number of

49
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,640
people but so

50
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,640
even those that are in there so no one

51
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,519
interferes with anyone else's area and

52
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,040
they're searching

53
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,798
i want to determine a starting point you

54
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,159
want to establish a command post

55
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,240
you want to maintain communication

56
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,880
between all people involved

57
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,078
just to insert as anything comes up that

58
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,599
everyone is aware

59
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,118
i want to rotate people through areas to

60
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,640
ensure more than one person looks at

61
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,000
each area to reduce the chance that a

62
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
detail is missed

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
everyone's going to probably miss some

64
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,078
little detail we don't have a ton of

65
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
people going in there

66
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,759
but having someone go through and do a

67
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,519
second sweep of an area is definitely

68
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,759
well advised

69
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,039
now these search patterns so exactly how

70
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,560
you're going to search a room

71
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
well there's something called a spiral

72
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,000
search method and this starts at an

73
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,680
outer point and gradually moves

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
toward the center we're going to start

75
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
at an inner point and move outward

76
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,318
from that center as we kind of see the

77
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,719
images here

78
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,799
so depending on the room depending on

79
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,639
the area depending on the scene may

80
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
influence what type of search method you

81
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,159
use but this is

82
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
one example and this is called a spiral

83
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,680
search here

84
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
now moving on from a spiral search we

85
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
also have a grid method

86
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
so the grid method scene is divided into

87
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,119
grid and each grid is

88
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
segmented in the search just as the name

89
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
implies you have this kind of very boxy

90
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
like look

91
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,560
and you're searching and focusing on

92
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,238
those different boxes within that

93
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,479
overall grid

94
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,080
then we get to a line search which is

95
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,840
crime scene divided into strips

96
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
and each strip is searched again this

97
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,120
could be based on limiting factors

98
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,919
this is just another search pattern that

99
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,039
can be used

100
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,318
line or parallel search here

101
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,840
then we get into what we call a zone

102
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,399
search and this is a quadrant or zone

103
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
search

104
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
kind of has a similar properties to the

105
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,598
grid method but in this case

106
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
the scene is divided into quadrants in

107
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,039
each quadrant is searched so it's a

108
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
little bit broader based here

109
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,400
this is again more important documenting

110
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,239
where north is involved to know

111
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
where the zones are actually located in

112
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,120
a room and what evidence might be found

113
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,878
in those areas or how that room might be

114
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,319
set up can influence whether this one is

115
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,318
selected

116
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,759
the search pattern selection so as i

117
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,518
said kind of those are the general

118
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,280
overview but how we actually go about

119
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,360
selecting or determining which one we're

120
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,039
going to use is important

121
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
that can come down to the size type of

122
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,400
location of the area it's an

123
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,439
indoor location or is it an outdoor

124
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,319
location

125
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,759
how big is it if it's an indoor compared

126
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,039
to an outdoor there's a lot of trees in

127
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,039
the outdoors and open park

128
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,239
things to consider also the personnel

129
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,719
and equipment how many people do you

130
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,158
have

131
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,919
what equipment is needed and what do you

132
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,439
have access to you know we all like to

133
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,719
have the ideal amount but

134
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,158
a lot of times we're limited and

135
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,280
restricted so that's going to influence

136
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,039
what search we may

137
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,799
select the type of crime that was

138
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,318
committed if we can establish that or

139
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,080
have an idea of that early on

140
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,359
this can impact the type of evidence

141
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
that's going to be collected

142
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
and that can also influence how what

143
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,679
pattern you choose

144
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,959
so you can be most effective now

145
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
evidence from the victim

146
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,479
themselves well this may be collected by

147
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,239
a medical examiner

148
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,519
evidence often includes from the actual

149
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,798
victim would be fiber from their

150
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,319
clothing hair from their head

151
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,918
in pubic areas blood hand swabs for

152
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,079
gunpowder if that was

153
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,758
suspected to be part of the crime and

154
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,839
also photographs

155
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,800
so this is a lot of information just

156
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,359
from the victim

157
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,879
never mind the surrounding area as well

158
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
so just keep these in mind and we're

159
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,079
kind of going through and establish and

160
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,720
search a crime scene

161
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,519
to be effective and efficient because it

162
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
is

163
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,519
only a one-time shot at getting that

164
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,519
evidence undisturbed
