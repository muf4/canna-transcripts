00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,678
welcome to another video here on debaco

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,879
university

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,439
in this video we're going to be looking

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,280
at animal versus human hairs

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,719
and different regions when you want to

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,199
look at and inspect them

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,480
and how a animal hair would compare to

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,759
that of a human hair

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,320
so you could hopefully distinguish

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,039
between the two so first off

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,640
human or animal there are some general

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,679
characteristics of each type of hair

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
that can help

14
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,439
initially classify it as whether you're

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
looking at a human hair or an animal

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
hair because if you find something at

17
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,799
the crime scene

18
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,039
even though there may have been humans

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,200
involved you want to be able to rule out

20
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,039
or classify it as just human or animal

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
in the general category

22
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,640
so first off animal versus human hair

23
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,479
looking at the general size

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,759
for length the human scalp errors tend

25
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,519
to be longer than most

26
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,000
animal hairs we're looking at the

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
diameter human hairs are usually in the

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,480
range

29
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,799
of 0.05 to 0.15

30
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,238
millimeters animal hairs can be narrower

31
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,159
or coarser

32
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,320
so just that quick little comparison

33
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,119
there i can help you initially start to

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,558
classify it

35
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,640
a lot of this comes with just seeing a

36
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,239
lot of samples as well

37
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
now analysis human hair looking at the

38
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,719
pigmentation in particular

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
well for human hairs gently consistent

40
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,679
pigment throughout the hair shaft

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
with slight increase in density towards

42
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360
the cuticle for animal hairs the color

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
is more essentially distributed

44
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,280
throughout the more dense

45
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,560
towards the medulla region we're looking

46
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,879
at the color banding

47
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,560
for human hairs or when untreated it can

48
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,239
usually lack banding

49
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,680
while animal hairs will have a banded

50
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,920
appearance to them

51
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,840
for hair treatments human hair can be

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
treated and animal hair

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,040
rarely exhibits dyeing bleaching or

54
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,759
other cosmetic

55
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
treatments so again keep that in mind

56
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,118
when you're looking at

57
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,399
investigating here the pigmentation

58
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,799
portion

59
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
now looking at the medulla region so

60
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,280
we're looking at kind of the microscopic

61
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,000
view

62
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
of comparison comparing these hair types

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
for human hairs they only have

64
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,759
an amorphous medullar structure animal

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
hairs can have a complex regular

66
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
geometric

67
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
cellular medulla for the medullary index

68
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,959
which is the ratio of the diameter of

69
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,599
the medulla to the diameter of the

70
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,239
actual

71
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,519
hair the human hair is almost always

72
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
less than one-third

73
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,439
and anal hair is usually greater than

74
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
one-third a lot of times often greater

75
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,000
than

76
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,839
one-half and we kind of see some

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
examples here identifying them

78
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
we have the buffalo the camel on the cow

79
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,439
the horse the donkey

80
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,480
the sheep the goat the dog and the cat

81
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,199
here and this little sidebar here is 62

82
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,719
and a half

83
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,959
micrometers for comparison now kind of

84
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,719
the anatomy of the human hair versus the

85
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,519
animal hair provided with a lot of kind

86
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,878
of

87
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,120
comparison points so if you're looking

88
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,799
at the shaft region animal hairs

89
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,719
tend to have different shapes than

90
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
humans such as that

91
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,560
spatula shape found in rodent hairs

92
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,639
really get the root of the hair

93
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,239
well human hair will have a bulb or

94
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,598
ribbon shaped root

95
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
while animal hairs can have different

96
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,119
shaped roots typically kind of brush

97
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
like in their appearance

98
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,039
at the tip of the hair particularly

99
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,959
human hair of the scalp

100
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,560
is usually cut or frayed at the tip

101
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
while animal hair is usually

102
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,400
that has that natural kind of taper to

103
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,039
it so when we're looking at the scale

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,439
region

105
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,239
of human hair only exhibits a regular

106
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,400
angular

107
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
kind of scale patterns while animal hair

108
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
will have a variety of types

109
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,759
and can have more than one type in

110
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,440
within the same hair

111
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,959
lastly looking at the cross section in

112
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,680
my hairs to have some more unusual

113
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,158
shapes

114
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
for example um kind of like a dog bone

115
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,759
um like shape which is

116
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,039
evident of rabbit hair as just one

117
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,679
example or

118
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,878
a cigar shaped and that is evident that

119
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,480
of a seal

120
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,318
so those are just some obvious kind of

121
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,399
cross-section shapes that can help you

122
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,199
potentially identify or classify

123
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,719
what animal it came from so keep in mind

124
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,958
there's a lot of comparisons that can be

125
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,560
made between human and animal hairs

126
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,759
and while humans may be animals we're

127
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,719
looking at the different types of

128
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,560
species of

129
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,158
animals and hopefully this provides you

130
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
with kind of some quick little regions

131
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,438
to look at

132
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,280
and how to identify whether it's human

133
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,280
or if it's animal hair
