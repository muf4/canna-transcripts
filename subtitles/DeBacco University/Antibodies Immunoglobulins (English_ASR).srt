1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
so here we're going to look at

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,048
antibodies or immunoglobulins both are

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,929
interchangeable terms we see the image

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,420
here on the title slide with a constant

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,129
region in a variable region the variable

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,679
regions here is referring to the ends

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,320
here no sizzle cutaways shape is very

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,329
important these proteins need to bind to

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,219
antigens and this is why there's a

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,098
variable region up here is because of

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,689
different shapes these can take time so

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,480
looking specifically at the definition

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,640
of an amino globulin these are class of

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,159
proteins of the immune system that are

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,289
also known as antibodies says as I said

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,039
a kind of interchangeable terms but what

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,589
is an empty body

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,019
well antibodies are attached to foreign

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,030
substances to allow the immune system to

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,070
destroy them it's important to make note

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,929
here that the antibodies are not the

22
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,570
ones doing the destruction they're

23
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,789
merely attaching to the surfaces to kind

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,039
of signal the immune system to come

25
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,379
destroy this foreign substance they're

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,439
specific to each type of horse for in

27
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:04,079
some sense so this variable region these

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,569
specific shapes match a very specific

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,060
foreign substance so as a result we have

30
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,618
many different types of antibodies now

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,509
we can classify them into these five

32
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:18,030
main groups IgA IgG IgM IgE and IgD in

33
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,969
the IG sitting for abbreviation of for

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,978
the immunoglobulin each or levels of

35
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,509
each type of these antibodies can give

36
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,039
your doctor and indication about the

37
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,719
cause of a medical problem

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,030
so as we'll see in some of the certain

39
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,328
tests will do for certain antibodies to

40
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,939
determine if your body's been exposed to

41
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,489
certain antigens now within our

42
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,559
classifications we have monomers dimer

43
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,269
is referring to two and Penta MERS he

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,960
referring to five different ones

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:49,319
only IgM sarpent immers iga s are

46
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,649
diverse in IgG IgE and IgG or both

47
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,228
monomer antibodies so starting with the

48
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,790
IgA here the fountain airs the body such

49
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,099
as the nose breathing passages and

50
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,930
digestive tract it's important that

51
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,339
these antibodies are located in these

52
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,899
regions because they protect body

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,020
surfaces that are exposed to the outside

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,899
foreign substances this is our specialty

55
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,900
about 10 to 15 percent of antibodies

56
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,830
present in the body or iga s and a small

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,909
number of people actually

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,010
produce IgE antibodies it's a rarity so

59
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:22,049
do you need them to live no but by

60
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:24,840
having them you're able to better

61
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,900
protect your surfaces that are in direct

62
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,599
exposure to the outside environment with

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,730
IG G's so keep in mind the second my

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,710
first G I should say is lowercase in the

65
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:35,759
second G is uppercase they're found in

66
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,500
all body fluids

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,079
they're a monomer they're the most

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,810
common IMT body found in the body about

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,969
75 to 80 percent it's important for

70
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,400
fighting bacterial and viral infections

71
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,590
and only type of antibody that can cross

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,129
the placenta and pregnant women this

73
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,020
helps protect her baby or fetus they're

74
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,349
also utilized here as we see this Zika

75
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,120
virus antibody test IgG and IgM antibody

76
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,090
test so if we're looking for someone

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,980
that may be exposed to the Zika virus

78
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,379
might be carrying it some way we can

79
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,269
test for the antibodies to see if

80
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,699
they're present and this is why the

81
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,120
antibody test you see here in here in

82
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,459
ihe G and IgM indication referring to

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,580
the antibodies classification that this

84
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,830
test is in tune if it's indicated with

85
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,480
its presence

86
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,219
IgM are found in the blood and lymph

87
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,810
fluid are the first type of antibody

88
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,699
made in response to an infection and

89
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,310
they cause other immune system cells to

90
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,289
destroy foreign substances IgM and

91
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,849
devisor about 5% percent of all the

92
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,379
antibodies in the body and they're the

93
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,930
only ones that fall into the pentamer

94
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,840
class we see our antibody level we have

95
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,719
initial dose of a legitimacy IgM primary

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,409
response increases above IgG and then

97
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,800
goes away

98
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,989
our second dose of antigen the IgM does

99
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,650
come back but our IgG you can see very

100
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,450
different so IgM is the the first type

101
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,730
of antibody made in response to an

102
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,649
infection that initial or primary

103
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:04,859
response they are made during the

104
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,750
secondary dose of the antigen but you

105
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,410
could see that in relation to IgG their

106
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,750
secondary immune response is minimal

107
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:14,280
IgE if you suffer from allergies this is

108
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,199
one that you can blame here they're

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,149
found in the lungs skin and mucous

110
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,949
membranes they caused by to react

111
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,829
against foreign substance such as pollen

112
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,509
fungal spores in animal dander they're

113
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:27,599
involved in allergic reactions the

114
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,980
levels of IgE are often high in people

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,930
with allergies and there's certain

116
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,000
limits as far as what would be

117
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,889
considered a low level moderate high and

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,709
very high levels here and we can

119
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,479
classify them as such so if you are more

120
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:42,569
sensitive to certain pollens or

121
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,770
allergens you can probably vein i GE for

122
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:48,240
your reactions IgD isn't IG is an

123
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,680
interesting one these are antibodies

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
found in small amounts in the tissues

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,550
that lie in the belly and chest

126
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,560
however exactly how they work is

127
00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:00,389
actually not 100% clear so they do exist

128
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,060
we now observe presence they do have

129
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,459
some very basic idea of their

130
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,009
understanding but exactly how they work

131
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:11,669
specifically is actually not clear just

132
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,259
goes to show scientists are continuing

133
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,060
to do research on things that we may

134
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,689
know exists but we need to understand

135
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,310
better how they perform and work a way

136
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,139
to mount device to kind of remember

137
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,500
these it's called gamed so you don't

138
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,389
forget any G AME D and this is referring

139
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,339
to the different antibodies there this

140
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,949
is also a great summary slide to kind of

141
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:35,789
give you that review of what my G G does

142
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:38,370
IgM IgD and so on and so forth lastly

143
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,140
the five immunoglobin classes here we

144
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,689
see the names we see the properties and

145
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,389
associated with the structure here on

146
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:48,360
the right hand side just another way to

147
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:50,490
help your review and help you understand

148
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,290
the difference between the different

149
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,560
types of the musical elements present in

150
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,560
your body
