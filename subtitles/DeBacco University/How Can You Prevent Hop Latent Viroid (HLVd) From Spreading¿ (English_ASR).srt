1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,620
so a question many Growers are asking

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,480
how can I prevent hoplate and virid from

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,759
spreading in this debacle University

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,300
video we'll go through and how to answer

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,300
this question

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,259
[Music]

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,939
okay so if you're wondering how I can

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,618
prevent happily Environ from spreading

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,719
this is the video for you

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,160
so let's do some additional resources

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,559
you might want to consider in addition

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,179
to this one there's one presentation

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,179
provided here as well as a little bit of

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,219
a pica podcast interview style

15
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:37,200
additional resources again these links

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,300
can be found in the description of this

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
video under the references and works

18
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,599
cited portion

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,218
so how do you prevent it from spreading

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
well it all starts with knowing what you

21
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,340
have and having a good testing and

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,719
screening protocol this doesn't mean

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,879
just testing a couple plants in your

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,679
entire operation students testing all of

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,839
your plants a lot of grower friendly

26
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,479
kits are available but this we reliant

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,640
on you to be very organized uh be very

28
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,979
good with your labeling and essentially

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,460
establishing or knowing what you have is

30
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,500
a good start to any process to prevent

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,719
something from spreading

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,060
now if you're sending samples off to get

33
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,500
tested what should you be doing while

34
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,780
you're waiting for those results to come

35
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,060
back and this is just good growing

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,700
practices in general so adhering to

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,759
strict and consistent tool sterilization

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,460
processes is very important PPE for

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,978
workers you know having you know masks

40
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:31,019
and hoodies and gloves and booties for

41
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,280
the shoes all good things you should be

42
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,859
implementing in your indoor grow

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,719
operation rigorous testing protocols

44
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,719
I'll repeat testing particularly of the

45
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,759
mother room if not your other rooms as

46
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,219
well but definitely if you're going to

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,259
pair down to one area Focus definitely

48
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,578
on the mother room especially if you're

49
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,078
taking clones from those you want to

50
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,658
ensure those clones are going to be

51
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,158
viroid free now initially I want to take

52
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,500
more plants in the bedroom as well

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,659
because if one is infected it can easily

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,060
infect others

55
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,500
now the obvious is plant eradication you

56
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,519
know how can go about eliminating this

57
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,140
well if you eliminate the host

58
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,298
essentially eliminate the thyroid

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,340
removing plants that test positive and

60
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,739
moving them and followed by a continual

61
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,000
testing can reduce the presence of high

62
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,039
folate and thyroid in a growing

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,659
operation so here's just an example here

64
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,459
we're starting with you know a lot of

65
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,680
plants and slowly over time that trend

66
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,500
is going down removing those infected

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,540
plants is really key and important maybe

68
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,459
higher numbers to start with but in the

69
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,500
long run it will save you a lot of

70
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,300
frustration and kind of stop this

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,098
hopefully from fighting it on a

72
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,620
continual basis identify those few

73
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,079
plants get rid of those ensure others

74
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,360
are also testing clean repeat testing is

75
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,879
also important to help keep ensuring

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,700
you're reducing those numbers

77
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,318
now cleaning tools and surfaces sounds

78
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,060
great to any good sanitation protocol

79
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,039
that should be done on a regular basis

80
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,120
however the product you select is your

81
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:56,159
cleaner may make the area look clean but

82
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,420
may not have an impact on Happily and

83
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,340
thyroids this is something very

84
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,299
interesting a lot of Growers don't know

85
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,219
this

86
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,200
so here are some methods that a great

87
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,019
looking an area clean or sterilization

88
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,839
that really are not effective these do

89
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,640
not work on Hop latent uh thyroid might

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,800
work for other things such as bacteria

91
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,679
or more living things but not the viroid

92
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,659
if you use alcohol even 99 isopropyl

93
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,400
that's not going to work alcohol and

94
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:22,400
then flame that's not going to work and

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,158
just flaming tools with high heat

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,319
hydrogen peroxide acetic acid or you

97
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,919
know uh the Etsy acid and vinegar

98
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,479
ammonium clear such as Lysol UV light

99
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,979
UVC exposure on the leaves and roots for

100
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,318
five minutes all right it's still

101
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,359
present all these are ineffective

102
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,039
methods if you're looking at targeting a

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,840
viroid so this leads to the question

104
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,658
well what would be viable

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,860
so what does work at least on tools and

106
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,219
surfaces we're not cleaning plant

107
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,620
material that's even more difficult

108
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:55,019
vercon as two percent household bleach

109
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,259
in the 10 to 20 range for 30 to 60

110
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,939
seconds is also effective common lab

111
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,000
saying that was in the lab and working

112
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,318
it was 10 bleach for 10 minutes and

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,019
that's something I would recommend

114
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,399
though if you are using bleach or really

115
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,438
any of these you want to mix and use

116
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,420
them the same day you don't let them sit

117
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,060
for a long portion a long duration of

118
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,939
time their effectiveness does Wane or

119
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,238
does get reduced over time so household

120
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:23,040
bleach and this workout s two ones that

121
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,418
are effective compared to all the lists

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
all the other ones that many people

123
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:30,120
think are effective but not for a viroid

124
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,800
so same cannot be applied to the root or

125
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,240
actually plant tissue itself the

126
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,879
previous products or recommendations are

127
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,740
for tools and surfaces and those

128
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,079
effective in those those are effective

129
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,180
in those situations are not effective at

130
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,199
cleaning actual plant material so you

131
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,000
think you're going to like I've got some

132
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,319
Infected Roots let me dip them in bleach

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,519
or do this

134
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,439
um it's not really going to clean the

135
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,258
plant material it's only going to affect

136
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,418
the sap that's kind of on the bench on

137
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,060
the tools on the working surface there

138
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,099
you're not going to clean plant uh with

139
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,959
these methods

140
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,639
if you see radiation this is effective

141
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,439
you see radiation on the hot plate and

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,978
thyroid stability in Roots and leaves

143
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,899
are is very stable in plant tissue this

144
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,120
makes it very hard to clean the plant

145
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,679
material or rid the area of that thyroid

146
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,240
which is why it should be bagged and

147
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,978
physically removed from the location

148
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,360
you're not going to oh here's an

149
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,639
infected plant let me hit it with a lot

150
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,439
of UV light and then remove it now you

151
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,900
want to kind of put a bag carefully over

152
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,418
it and you want to seal it up minimizing

153
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,099
your contact with that plant keeping it

154
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,019
in the bag sitting the bag up and then

155
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,879
physically removing it the shortest

156
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,939
route possible to the furthest dumpster

157
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,100
possible to get it out of the groin area

158
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,719
uh sap again is much more difficult the

159
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,520
best method staff containing variants

160
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,400
maybe nucleases so this is something

161
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,379
used in a lab to basically disrupt uh

162
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,379
DNA or RNA

163
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:51,538
um so these this fibroid is rna-based so

164
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,819
this might be one way to kind of use

165
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:57,418
this to go through and clean the plant

166
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,459
but keep in mind these can be uh much of

167
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,519
a concern because particularly ones that

168
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:05,339
alter DNA you have DNA in your hands you

169
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,500
want to be mindful of that so this is a

170
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:08,879
laboratory approach that is showing some

171
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,918
early indications of potential

172
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,740
Effectiveness however it's application

173
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,019
to actual plants actively growing plants

174
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,259
in a growing operation still get to be

175
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,698
well established or understood so while

176
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,500
it may work in a lab setting this might

177
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,538
work for potential tissue culture

178
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,860
operation but not really for an

179
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:31,379
established plant that careful identify

180
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:34,500
bag tag and remove would be what I would

181
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:37,918
recommend in that continual screening is

182
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,139
the core of any group any good protocol

183
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,439
to reduce the spread of hoplate and

184
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,439
thyroid
