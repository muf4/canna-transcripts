1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,198
in this video on debacle university you

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,480
will learn

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,559
how to use bone analysis to determine

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
age how we can use simply looking at the

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,039
bone to determine the age

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,519
of the individual so first off

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,278
in the matrix bone cells are surrounded

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,399
by a matrix which is a non-living

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,399
hardened material

10
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,079
which they produce this matrix is

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,159
composed mainly of calcium

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,159
and phosphorus compounds along with

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
proteins that make bone hard

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,359
and slightly flexible while still

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
maintaining a very strong

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
structure because it is supporting the

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,039
entire body

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
in this case it needs to be hard but it

19
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,079
does have

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
a slight degree of flexibility to it we

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,640
always think of it containing calcium

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,200
which it does but we

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,558
also contains high amounts of phosphorus

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,920
for the body

25
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,359
the liculi are those are microscopic

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,480
canals between

27
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,558
the leukemia and the ossified bone

28
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,839
so when we're looking at a microscopic

29
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,479
view of the

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
bone here we can start to see some of

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,519
these structures

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,400
we have this kind of cementing line

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,400
evident here the osteons

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
liqueur kind of those little canals we

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,760
see here

36
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,719
and then the leukemia are located right

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,719
here

38
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,158
and this can be important when we're

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,560
looking through a microscope

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,479
to be use these to be identified the age

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,159
of that individual

42
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,000
when we're looking at these bone cells

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,880
keep in mind that we do have bone that's

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
constantly being

45
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,000
reformed and it's constantly being

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
broken down no matter

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,879
your age the age of the individual will

48
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,118
influence the rate that this occurs

49
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,039
we have the osteocyte which remains a

50
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,879
bone tissue with the osteoblast which

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
forms the actual matrix that i talked

52
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,519
about

53
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,200
the osteogenic cell which is the stem

54
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,319
cell kind of that early on cell that's

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
going through and

56
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,879
forming many of the rest in the

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,879
osteoclast which is reabsorbing a bone

58
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,478
material and all these are kind of

59
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,319
occurring ideally in a nice

60
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,840
balance for the individual the histology

61
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,239
or looking kind of at the microscopic

62
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
view

63
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,399
of compact bone just to kind of give you

64
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
that this is looking at 10x

65
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
of ground bone here uh what it can look

66
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,280
like and kind of what we're

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,280
focusing on the ovarian uh uh the

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,878
parish xi'an canal is what we're going

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
to be looking at here we could see

70
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,840
looking at this

71
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,719
bone here it gets a little confusing but

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
looking at

73
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,080
his varying system here we can really

74
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,159
focus in on that

75
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,440
and this is the area within a field of

76
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,919
view that we're going to be

77
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,919
looking at so to determine that

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,439
approximate age of the individual

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,039
looking at the number of osteons present

80
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,359
in bone sample taking measurements of

81
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,159
the

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
variance canals diameters can also be

83
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,959
useful

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,280
we use this information to calculate the

85
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,000
estimated age of the bone sample

86
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
ideally at the time of death here and

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
that can be used on a skeleton

88
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,000
that we may not know the height

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
individual may know very little about it

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,280
this is looking at that very small we

91
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,639
don't need a very small portion of that

92
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,959
bone bone fragment

93
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,639
to heal to determine the age looking at

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,439
the image right below me here looking at

95
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,199
an x-ray of the hand of a

96
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,039
16.27 year old male with an automatic

97
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,238
calculation of bone age with

98
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,878
the bone expert it's kind of puts uh

99
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,719
some measurements there puts some kind

100
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,598
of calculations and puts it into an

101
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,080
algorithm and generates an estimated age

102
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,079
based on a simple x-ray

103
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,360
now these osteons that i had mentioned

104
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
they're thin and long

105
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
cylindrical structures that contain

106
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,319
mineral matrix

107
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,598
and living osteocytes connected to the

108
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,280
liculi which transports blood these are

109
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,840
solid portions of the bone run its

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,919
length and

111
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,439
easily viewed with a microscope which is

112
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,439
why they tend to be used

113
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,719
as part of this calculation process so

114
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,239
you can see them kind of

115
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,519
represented in the cartoon image here

116
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,439
but on the other images you can see them

117
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
quite clearly

118
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,000
when we're looking at that microscope

119
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,518
what are we looking at we're going to be

120
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,199
counting the osteons

121
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,200
i want to use the bone specimen so it

122
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,318
completely fills a medium power or

123
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,079
100 x field of view count the total

124
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,598
number of aseans present in the entire

125
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,120
medium power field

126
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,199
now keep in mind the median power

127
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,599
objective lens here

128
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,560
would be 10 because we also have to take

129
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,119
into account

130
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,799
the microscope we're using not just the

131
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
objective lens here

132
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,920
so how do we go about that we'll keep in

133
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
mind we want the objective but we also

134
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,079
want to take into account

135
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,879
the eyepiece as well typically you're

136
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
looking at

137
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,879
the ips adding about 10x to that so in

138
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,280
that case where i want median power

139
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,000
looking

140
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,159
at 100x while the objective is 10

141
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
because the eyepiece adds another factor

142
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
of 10

143
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,240
that would be how we would get to 100x

144
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,279
if we use high power 400x that would be

145
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
the 40 times

146
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,719
10 would give you 400. this is going to

147
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
determine the number of aseans present

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,720
by using the

149
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,879
variance canals present if only half of

150
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,560
a canal is visible then you count it as

151
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,319
a 0.5 or half an osteon rarely move the

152
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,600
sample to 10 new locations and repeat

153
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,680
the process to get your

154
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
data i'll then calculate the average

155
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
number of osteons viewed under the high

156
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,319
power

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,439
to the hundredths place this is again

158
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,478
another way you can go through and do

159
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,560
this is multi and go

160
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,879
and do 10 samples lastly i want to

161
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,720
multiply the average by 16 to generate

162
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,600
the total number of aseans counted under

163
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,919
median power

164
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
which is needed for the age calculation

165
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,799
formula

166
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,639
so you can use the high power you just

167
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,919
take more samples and multiply it by a

168
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,079
factor of 16.

169
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,279
how you're going to use this information

170
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,719
and what does it look like

171
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,879
well the center of each osteon is a

172
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,039
hollow tube called that varian

173
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159
canal there it contains small blood

174
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,959
vessels that's kind of what you're

175
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,280
looking at

176
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,279
that kind of center region there that's

177
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,839
where ideally the blood vessels would be

178
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,279
present

179
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,159
in the individual now the diameter of

180
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,000
that canal

181
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
region easiest way to calculate the

182
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
diameter is to use the pointer found in

183
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,280
the microscope

184
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,120
so that kind of pointer there and

185
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,399
depends on the microscope you're using

186
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,399
but that pointer sometimes will even

187
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,918
have a measurement you can also place a

188
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,519
fine scale ruler under the microscope to

189
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,879
calibrate the length of that pointer for

190
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,519
the make script that you're particularly

191
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,038
using

192
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,639
note the modification will alter the

193
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,879
scale so make sure your calibration and

194
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
magnification are the same

195
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,800
recommend using typically 400x which is

196
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,198
high power is recommended

197
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,199
measure seven random canals not the

198
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,478
entire osteon under high power

199
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,680
using micrometers and note that 0.1

200
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,599
centimeters is one

201
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
millimeter and that equals a thousand

202
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
micrometers

203
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
and then you want to calculate the

204
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,560
average variance uh canal

205
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,080
diameter here that kind of gives you an

206
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
idea of that

207
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,079
increased magnification how that's going

208
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,360
to alter your scale

209
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,599
so kind of when we get to the end here

210
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,080
how do we kind of apply that formula

211
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
for age calculation procedure well we

212
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,159
take 30

213
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,079
we add it to the total number of us and

214
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,520
count in the entire 100x field of view

215
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,159
times 0.8

216
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,879
and we subtract it by the 0.3 times the

217
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,479
average of

218
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:45,120
varying canal diameter in micrometers

219
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,839
we take that those numbers and that will

220
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,680
give us the

221
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,239
approximate age of the individual by

222
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,439
plus or minus three years

223
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
so if you go back and kind of look at

224
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,319
the information presented here

225
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
uh get a a couple of bone slides look

226
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,639
under the microscope

227
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
get the calibration used to the

228
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,478
microscope that you're using

229
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,758
and you could kind of go through and do

230
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,680
this activity

231
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,598
to be able to determine the age of the

232
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,319
individual bone that you're looking at

233
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,038
plus or minus three years which is very

234
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,360
good for

235
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,959
getting a general classification of that

236
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,080
age of the individual can definitely

237
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,638
help the investigation

238
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,639
process
