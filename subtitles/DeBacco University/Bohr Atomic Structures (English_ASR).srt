1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,040
okay here we're gonna look at Bohr

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:07,290
atomic structures and how to depict and

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,949
draw out what's called a Bohr model of

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,599
the atom developed by Niels Bohr well

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,910
first off the Bohr model what is that

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,810
it's basically a simplified visual

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,278
representation of an atomic structure

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:22,679
assumes that electrons represented with

9
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,960
the e minus sign here move in fixed

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,329
orbits each of those orbits is

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,400
represents an energy level around the

12
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,739
nucleus we see that here here's our

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,738
nucleus these are energy level 1 mg

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,780
level 2 3 4 5 &amp; 6

15
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:38,968
now electrons have to exist in one

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,980
energy level or the other they cannot be

17
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,359
in between so again the reason why I

18
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,069
have the picture here of the elevator is

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,320
you can only go to certain levels you

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,119
can't go to like 1/2 level just like

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,439
electrons can't be at level two and a

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:54,419
half or two and a quarter

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:57,988
that's B 2 or 3 3 or 4 so 4 or 1 has to

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,309
be at very distinctive energy levels now

25
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,140
how would go about drawing the Bohr

26
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:04,530
model is we have some simple rules to

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,118
follow so looking at here we want to

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,650
draw the nucleus making sure to write

29
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,040
down the number of neutrons and protons

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,580
in the center region here after that

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,530
step 2 is going to be to look at drawing

32
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,780
a circle or an orbit around the nucleus

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,420
to represent the first energy level as

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,390
you see here now energy level 1 can hold

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,920
a maximum of 2 electrons

36
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:31,438
Marisa's located closest to the nucleus

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:34,320
level 2 no maximum 8 3 is 18 4 is 32

38
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,199
we're gonna focus mainly on the simpler

39
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,219
elements here to get an understanding

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,750
after you draw that circle around the

41
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,750
nucleus representing the first energy

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,700
level both go through and electron

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,099
should be drawn in pairs to make them

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,799
easy to count and must fill an energy

45
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,449
level before moving to the next so after

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,430
you have two electrons filled up in the

47
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,950
first energy level then you can move to

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,960
this second after the second you

49
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,750
can move to the third and then so on and

50
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,459
so forth so look at just a couple

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,968
examples here of periodic patterns

52
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,878
looking at Group 1 through 14 17 and 18

53
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,739
group 1 see the red is representing the

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,109
outermost shell or the valence electrons

55
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,620
in Group 1 each one of these has 1

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,080
valence

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,569
electron what we do notice is that

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,760
lithium here with its three electrons to

59
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:23,339
fill up the first energy level and then

60
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,969
one more it goes on the second energy

61
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,530
level with na or sodium - in that first

62
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,769
energy level we see one two three four

63
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,870
five six seven eight in the second

64
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:37,019
energy level in that third energy level

65
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,360
we have one more so that one is the one

66
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:43,289
valence electron now how do I know

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,739
sodium has these eleven electrons

68
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:50,280
oh if - here plus eight which is nine

69
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,079
ten eleven there's eleven protons so in

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,239
a neutral atom is going to be 11

71
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,090
electrons the same thing goes here for

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,829
fluorine neon and argon we're filling up

73
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,140
that first in G level progressing to the

74
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,659
second before with no under the third if

75
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,429
we have electron here meaning so take a

76
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:06,989
look at couple these models develop kind

77
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,540
of an understanding those how it is it's

78
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,128
relatively easy and I want you to go

79
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,858
through and look at some of these

80
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:16,649
examples and try them for yourself so

81
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:19,500
hydrogen phosphorous helium neon and

82
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:25,590
lithium so pause the video now and try

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:29,159
them for yourself my students are

84
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,919
pausing the video I don't know if

85
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:36,539
they're pausing the video on that mmm

86
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,919
hopefully there and okay so hopefully

87
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:39,810
you've gone through and you've taken

88
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,239
those steps and now we have a way to

89
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,159
check your answers so hopefully the

90
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,620
answers that you came up with they do

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,198
drew out on the Bohr models looks

92
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,120
similar to these if they don't go back

93
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,160
try to let them try to watch and

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,739
understand why they don't if not can

95
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,959
always email me or ask me for questions

96
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,730
and clarifications but hopefully this

97
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,128
develops a better idea of understanding

98
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:04,128
the Bohr model via via
