1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
okay here okay isolating mechanisms what

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,259
things may keep certain individuals

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,469
apart from one another that will

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,048
influence the genes that are passed on

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:16,368
to a generation or that are prevented

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:19,559
from intersecting within another species

7
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:21,269
so reproductive isolated populations

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,709
populations whose members do not mate

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,559
with each other or cannot produce

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,630
fertile offspring reproductive isolating

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,538
mechanisms are the barriers that prevent

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,299
genetic exchange between species so we

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,780
have an original population here and

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,119
we're seeing a shift into two different

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,439
isolated species here with our examples

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,729
of the Flies we have some that like

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:46,109
starch and maltose and then we have a

18
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:48,209
favoritism for one versus the other and

19
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,689
therefore we have individuals that may

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,660
only mate with those that like a certain

21
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:57,799
food source separating out and causing

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,538
subsets of the population to develop

23
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,399
flowers examples here can select for

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,159
their pollinators so some flowers have

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,609
evolved to attract only certain species

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,950
to help them appalling so the white

27
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:13,680
foxglove flowers adapted for bees and

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,259
this long tube shaped flower is better

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,850
for hummingbirds so this is an example

30
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,150
of flowers selecting first certain

31
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,519
pollinators to help attract and that is

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,049
reproductive isolation because the bees

33
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,509
will not be going through and pauline

34
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,100
these flowers this flower will be trying

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,340
to match the habits better of the

36
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,289
hummingbird and the bee there's

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,359
pre-psychotic isolating mechanisms and

38
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,329
this prevents the formation of a zygote

39
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,489
so this is a barrier that somehow

40
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,438
prevents the sperm getting to the egg or

41
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,839
the pollen to the egg and there's

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,789
postzygotic isolation mechanisms these

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,280
prevent popular functioning of as I go

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,750
after they formed so this is the zygote

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,219
is forming but then there's something

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,959
that's preventing it from growing to

47
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,890
have fully developed in normally

48
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,868
functioning individual temporal

49
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,939
isolation occurs when two populations

50
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:05,430
differ in their periods of activity or

51
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,349
reproductive cycles example so leopard

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,360
frogs in the wood frogs they reach

53
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,729
sexual maturity at different times in

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,830
the spring and hence do not interbreed

55
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:17,369
so this is an example of

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,320
temporal isolation behavioral isolation

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,659
occurs when two populations exhibit

58
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,169
different courtship patterns we have two

59
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:27,449
crickets here in certain populations

60
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:29,579
produced different mating songs so a

61
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:32,159
mate is only going to find the proper

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,770
individual that has the right song if an

63
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,609
individual's producing a different tune

64
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,710
or song or ritual they will not be

65
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,260
selected is part of me for that

66
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,599
particular population so the behaviors

67
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:49,889
that an individual exhibits can result

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,689
in its isolation there's geographic

69
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,849
isolation and this occurs when two

70
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:56,459
populations occupy different habitats or

71
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,379
separate niches within a common region

72
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,289
the example being lions and tigers

73
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,810
occupy different habits habitats and do

74
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:06,209
not interbreed at least usually they're

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,930
in different geographical areas

76
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,539
therefore they're not breeding together

77
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,250
this kind of is a nice summary table of

78
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:16,349
both pre and post zygotic isolating

79
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,729
mechanisms one over the temporal that's

80
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,799
when they made different times of the

81
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:22,009
year psychological is when two species

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,790
occupy different habits habitats

83
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,579
behavioral when they have different

84
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:29,000
courtship behaviors and mechanical

85
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,320
occurs when physical differences prevent

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,139
pollination for example in this case

87
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,259
different sized dogs simply mechanically

88
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,419
cannot produce offspring because they

89
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,829
can't physically meet postzygotic

90
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,208
isolation isms could be hybrid in in

91
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,070
viability which means the hybrids are

92
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,769
produced but failed developed to

93
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,539
reproductive maturity it's also hybrid

94
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,039
in fertility more hybrids failed to

95
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,319
produce functional gametes in their

96
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,419
sterile example of our mules in hybrid

97
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,359
breakdown where f1 hybrids are fertile

98
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,339
but f2 fails to develop properly so

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,370
these are giving you some examples and

100
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,099
these are some more specific examples of

101
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,180
the general pre and post I got it

102
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,180
isolating mechanisms
