1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,599
okay here we're gonna be looking at

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,919
chromatography and this is an example

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,878
shown here of paper chromatography but a

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,800
lot of the same

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,399
uh basic components will apply to

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,679
different types and forms of

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,000
chromatography

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,440
so first off you should provide a

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,960
definition of chromatography

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,640
it's a separation technique based on

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,400
different interactions or affinities of

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
compounds with two phases

13
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,719
a mobile phase is the name implies it

14
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,559
moves in a stationary phase

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,000
and that's a compound that stays fixed

16
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,719
in place and that is on

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,678
a supporting medium these interactions

18
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,640
are usually chemical

19
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,759
in nature but can also in some cases be

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,679
physical

21
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,920
and what you typically end up with at

22
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,759
least in paper chromatography

23
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,760
is what you see kind of right over here

24
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,238
is those kind of bands that occur of

25
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,839
different color separations

26
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,878
so just to get into some of those terms

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,399
with a little bit more detail provided

28
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,640
the affinities and natural attraction

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
force between things the mobile phase is

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,439
the solvent that flows through the

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,160
supporting medium so we can see here's

32
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,439
that solvent

33
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,198
here's that solvent front that's where

34
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,079
it's traveling that's its furthest point

35
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,679
of travel

36
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
we have the stationary phase which is a

37
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,879
layer or coating on the supporting

38
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
medium that interacts with the sample

39
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,879
it's like the coating on the paper the

40
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,478
paper itself is considered the

41
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,399
supporting medium and that's the solid

42
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,200
surface where the stationary phase is

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
bound to

44
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,400
or is coded onto uses for

45
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,719
chromatographies particularly

46
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,719
expands beyond forensic science uh it

47
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,959
can analyze components of mixtures based

48
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,719
on known values it can allow separation

49
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,118
of components in order to isolate

50
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,640
one of interest for further study it's

51
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,719
also used to determine the amount

52
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,319
in a mixture in our compounds present in

53
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,840
a sample and it can be very precise

54
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,118
illustration of chromatography in

55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,478
general as i mentioned there's kind of

56
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,078
mixed components there

57
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,679
you have this mixture you have a mobile

58
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,839
phase that mole phase is going to move

59
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
up and here you have that moving up of

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,920
the mobile phase

61
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,799
of the solvent as you can refer back to

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
here

63
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,640
this is our solvent moving up through

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,799
that

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
medium so that solvent that we see here

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
moving allows that mixture

67
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,000
or wants to be a mixture to then be

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,920
separated into its individual components

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,679
so how may this look well if we're kind

70
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
of looking at paper chromatography again

71
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,759
as an example we have a piece of paper

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,520
we have some colors we in this case we

73
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,280
have red blue and green

74
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,439
we're going to put that into a container

75
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,759
and we're going to put a solvent in it

76
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,919
that solvent line will be there and that

77
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,519
kind of allows us to put the colors

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,719
above that solvent and this is naturally

79
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
going to want to wick up

80
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,519
through this stationary phase

81
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
so that mobile phase will work its way

82
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,239
up through and we can see those colors

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
in this example will separate out and at

84
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,560
the very top here this is our solvent

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
front

86
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,800
and we can quantify this by measuring to

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,439
determine how far these particular

88
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,719
colors moved and what signatures or

89
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,680
chemical properties

90
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,680
they may have
