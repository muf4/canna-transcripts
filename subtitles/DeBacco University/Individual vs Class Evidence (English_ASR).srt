00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,480
video

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,639
here we're going to be looking at

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,278
individual and class evidence so when

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,320
we're looking

6
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,039
at identifying potential evidence does

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
it fall

8
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,439
into a category where we're looking at

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,359
we can eliminate

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,198
large or make broad statements to kind

11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,480
of put it into a class

12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,880
category or are we able to refine that

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
down to a potential individual

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,559
so we're looking at evidence in general

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,439
we want to keep in mind that typically

16
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,678
we're looking at this

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
class this general category of physical

18
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,280
evidence physical evidence is any item

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,480
that can be established as a link

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,600
between the crime

21
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,039
and a victim or the perpetrator examples

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,679
are document

23
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,320
hair fibers fingerprint soil and blood

24
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,320
would all

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
fall in the category of physical

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,238
evidence

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
now class evidence a little refinement

28
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,359
on that physical evidence

29
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,198
characteristics of this physical

30
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,320
evidence that can be associated only

31
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,878
with a group

32
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,600
and not a single source falls under the

33
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,039
category

34
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,320
of class evidence the intention of this

35
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,560
is to reduce the number of

36
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,158
suspects but it cannot pinpoint one

37
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,040
person or source

38
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,200
example would be blood type fibers pain

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
these are all examples of class

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
evidence so if we're looking at

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,840
identifying that there's a positive

42
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
blood at the scene

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,759
well that will eliminate the other blood

44
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,239
types but it won't

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,359
specify an individual person we find

46
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,280
certain fibers

47
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,759
we might find a garment that they may

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,079
match closely with but it doesn't say it

49
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
was

50
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,359
that garment in contrast when we have

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,280
individual

52
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,879
evidence well the characteristics of

53
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,719
individual evidence are that physical

54
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,039
evidence that can be connected

55
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,920
to a common source with a high degree of

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
certainty

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,118
anything that contains nuclear dna tool

58
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
marks

59
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,239
for example also fingerprints can fall

60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,200
under

61
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,839
the general category of being individual

62
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,159
evidence

63
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
because we're able to eliminate a lot

64
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,520
more potential suspects

65
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,200
and get ideally to that single person

66
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,118
now keep in mind here as an example here

67
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
hair varies in texture from one region

68
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,080
of the body to another

69
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,159
it can only be used to determine

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,039
similarities in not a single source

71
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,079
connection

72
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,399
therefore here falls under the category

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
of

74
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,360
class evidence example how round or

75
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,199
oval's cross-section is

76
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,959
typically caucasians tend to have more

77
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,878
of that rounder kind of

78
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
appearance to them oval flat and

79
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,280
cross-section tends to be more that of

80
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,598
african-americans but again this is only

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,719
class evidence and not looking at

82
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,878
identifying

83
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,878
any one particular individual
