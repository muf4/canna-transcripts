1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
here we're gonna look at the term

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,719
entropy and I kind of like this image

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,780
right here and as we learned about the

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,000
term this has a very low entropy this is

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,968
a very high entropy on this side here

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,190
low entropy is nice neat organized high

7
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:20,969
entropy we see that increase in disorder

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,800
net spreading L so entropy it's the

9
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,948
measure of the degree of randomness or

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,528
disorder or usable energy in a closed

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,779
system that's not available for useful

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,689
work so when we see something as low

13
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,700
entropy is a much more ordered system

14
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:38,759
see here a low entropy nice ordered

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,190
organized system here as you can see

16
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:44,070
here in the tall tower here we are have

17
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,599
a very low entropy and we are increasing

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,878
our entropy here with that increasing

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,989
amount of randomness that occurs high

20
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:50,640
entropy can have a high amount of

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,030
maintenance this disorganization this

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,049
disorder you see that low entropy

23
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,198
progressing to an area of high entropy

24
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:01,558
the second law of thermodynamics is that

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,500
referring to is a referring to entropy

26
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,048
increases so again low entropy nice and

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,540
organized high entropy very random you

28
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,549
can see that in this also the controlled

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,479
demolition of the Colosseum in New Haven

30
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:18,060
so we start with that low entropy

31
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,920
everything's nice neat and organized and

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,400
then the explosive go up go off and now

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,109
we have a very high degree of entropy we

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,700
have that kind of increasing in the

35
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,709
amount of randomness we start very nice

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,340
neat and organized and it was a very

37
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,438
random messy pile there so entropy

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,180
referring it to the food chain and

39
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,149
trophic levels the useful energy

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,159
available to the next level decreases so

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,430
as this mean so we have our sun's energy

42
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,750
here and that is involved as our primary

43
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,360
producers a hundred percent of the

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,340
energy here as we work from primary

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,890
producers to primary consumers up our

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,478
trophic levels roughly 10 percent of the

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,210
energy is transferred from one trophic

48
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,158
level to the next so we're simply moving

49
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,109
that decimal by 10 and this is

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,329
preventing large amounts of trophic

51
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,890
levels this is why our apex predators

52
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:06,898
are so few and far between

53
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,509
while our primary producers are very

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,669
prevalent the sun's energy and recycle

55
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,839
nutrients are the main sources of energy

56
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,269
here in our pyramid

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,250
now as we're reducing or the amount of

58
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,659
energy that's transferred where's it

59
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,879
energy going we have to still take

60
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,969
account for that well a lot of it's lost

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,979
energy as heat so when I say the word

62
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,870
lost we know where it goes it just

63
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,509
becomes unusable that's why we consider

64
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,489
it lost and also decomposers to any one

65
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:35,098
of these stages can break these trophic

66
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,569
levels down and add back in the recycled

67
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:38,789
nutrients to the bottom of the pyramid

68
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:41,159
that the primary producers can use and

69
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:44,129
then again it can fall into the cycle

70
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,709
here so hopefully this is a little bit

71
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,979
of an understanding what entropy is and

72
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,959
the degree of randomness or the degree

73
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,449
of disorder that may exist in your life

74
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,709
you could relate it to your room where

75
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,689
your room might have a high degree of

76
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,069
entropy where it's very messy when you

77
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,039
go through and organize it you'll have a

78
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:05,000
very low sense of entropy a high degree

79
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,000
of organization
