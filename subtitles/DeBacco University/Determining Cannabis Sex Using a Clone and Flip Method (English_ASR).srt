1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
on this tobacco university video i'll be

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,919
looking at determining cannabis sex

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:10,480
using a clone in flip method this is a

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,439
very simple method that anyone can do

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,638
it also helps refine one's ability to go

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,198
through and do cloning

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,399
but this can be a very important process

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,279
to be able to determine

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,358
whether you're going to have a male

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,000
plant or a female plant and really

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,240
hopefully

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,198
reduce the care that you need to give to

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,358
your plants

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,320
that are male so that you can focus on

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,030
those that are going to be high

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:38,000
cannabinoid producers

17
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:39,679
[Music]

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
all right let's get into the video here

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,359
to show you how to go about this clone

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,800
and flip method

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,079
well first off why would you want to

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,759
know whether your plant was male or

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
female to begin with well keep in mind

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,759
that the male plants are going to

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,520
produce pollen

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,679
and really are only desirable by

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,359
breeders female plants will produce high

28
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,640
amounts of cannabinoids and those tend

29
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,719
to be desirable by growers

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
looking to produce high chemical and

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,320
terpene densities

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,439
so most growers are looking for female

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,599
plants but

34
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,959
early on before flowering it's very

35
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,399
difficult to tell

36
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,478
whether you have a male plant or a

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
female plant you have to take care of it

38
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,599
and that could be wasted resources if

39
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,239
you're growing a male plant that you're

40
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,280
not going to

41
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,478
have any return on investment at the end

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,879
so when we're going through and cloning

43
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,239
our plant the cloning process is the

44
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,399
same as if we plan

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,679
was to propagate the plant so if you

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
have a good cloning process

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
we want to refine that this is a method

48
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,199
that can help you with that

49
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,560
growers should take an early branch from

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
a plant to be able to determine the

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
gender before pre-flowers develop

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,560
naturally so this can be done very early

53
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,159
on in the plant growing process

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,320
however the goal is to ensure that this

55
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
is a quick process since growers

56
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,919
want to know what plants to call and

57
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,240
which ones to keep so keep in mind

58
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,799
you're

59
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,239
also labeling and tagging everything

60
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
unlike traditional cloning the photo

61
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,478
period for the clones or in the clone

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,599
room

63
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,478
should be under a 12 12 12 hours late

64
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,199
into a large dark

65
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,159
flowering duration so you can be able to

66
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,159
determine

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
or force flowers early so you might

68
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,399
determine we have a male or female plant

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
now we'll talk about forcing flowers

70
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,118
here was this kind of term forcing

71
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,560
flowers referred to

72
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,080
well the flying photoperiod will induce

73
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
flower formation and this can be very

74
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
early on in a plant's

75
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
life cycle or development the goal since

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,280
the morphology of the flower produced

77
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
will indicate the gender of the plant so

78
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
being able to

79
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,598
recognize those flowers early on will

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
definitely be advantageous

81
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,878
keeping records is important so growers

82
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
know what branch or clone matches what

83
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,479
stock or original

84
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
plant was utilized to be able to match

85
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,919
that up and we're talking about on a

86
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,439
very small level we can see the arrow

87
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,280
pointing right here

88
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,959
as well as flowers here both of these

89
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,878
referring to or showing

90
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
female flowers so how do these differ

91
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,719
compared to male flowers

92
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,559
well we see them side by side because

93
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,359
right here this is what we're looking

94
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,318
for in

95
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,000
flowers so over on this side here we can

96
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,159
see that these are all

97
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
male flowers here you can see the kind

98
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,079
of pollen sacs that will

99
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,598
develop in contrast we see the female

100
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,879
flowers we see these white

101
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:05,359
wispy cat like whiskers here this is

102
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,439
a high surface area and ultimately these

103
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,360
would capture the pollen produced by the

104
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,280
male flowers so once you kind of see

105
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,239
them side by side the morphologies or

106
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,719
how they look

107
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
very distinctive so keep in mind that

108
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,560
the earlier you can identify these if

109
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,119
you

110
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,318
are growing a male plant you can cull

111
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
that plant and go back to the original

112
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,439
and get rid of that one

113
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
so you're focusing all your time energy

114
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,759
and resources

115
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,519
on the plants that will produce high

116
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,318
cannabinoids which will be those that

117
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,280
we're looking for

118
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,280
that have female flowers morphology
