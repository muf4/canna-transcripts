1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
now somebody consider grow a lifespan is

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,419
from when they buy it and first install

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,669
it to what it completely explodes and

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:11,820
dies this may not always be the case

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:15,419
because it will degrade over time so the

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,149
lifespan may be related to how much

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,649
efficiency can you tolerate or how much

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,768
loss of efficiency can you tolerate

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,599
before you throw that bulb out so that

10
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,518
usable life and put that life in quotes

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,170
there some lights may continue to

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,570
produce light but overall plant

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,390
production may suffer top growers will

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,850
change out bulbs when productivity will

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,239
suffer which is well before they

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,129
actually burn out or quote die so it's

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,039
important to consider that lifespan is

18
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:46,530
that light bulb is degrading over time

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,530
how much derogation are you willing to

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,570
tolerate before you change it out so a

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,370
lot of times these state bulbs in the

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,480
amount of hours that they can run so

23
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,799
it's important to have a quick little

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:01,140
conversions that one year is 8760 hours

25
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:03,509
if you're running 24 hours a day running

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,618
at 18 hour days you're looking at one

27
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:09,450
calendar year will be 6570 hours if

28
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,739
you're running a flowering stage which

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,049
is 12 hour days looking at 4380 hours is

30
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:19,319
what your bulb will accumulate over the

31
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,909
course of a calendar year then the

32
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,609
mounting position does impact the

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,618
lifespan the late bulbs operating

34
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,049
position affects its lifespan bulbs will

35
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,509
last longer when they're operated in a

36
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,420
vertical up and down position if the

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,790
same 20,000 our label this operated in a

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,109
horizontal or side-to-side position it

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,060
only lasts about 15,000 hours so while

40
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,219
they will last longer in the vertical

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,290
position keep in mind you're not quite

42
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,649
getting the efficiency of them from the

43
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,079
plant standpoint percent of light output

44
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,739
determines its life how much below new

45
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,109
to be 100% are you or the manufacturer

46
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,509
considered to be the life 80%

47
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,009
broken-down 75 60 there really is no

48
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,040
standards you have to develop what

49
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,438
percentage you determine that life to be

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
and this gives you the common bulb types

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,459
in the rated life high-pressure sodium

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,019
is about 5,000 hours and they'll be

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,689
about 95% and see the pen

54
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,790
specifically the bulb manufacturer to

55
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:22,840
choose to go with metal halides last

56
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:25,120
about $9,000 t5 for lessons last about

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,340
20,000 hours and they'll still be about

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,159
85 percent efficient ceramic metal

59
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,780
halides are about 20,000 hours also but

60
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,750
there will be running at 80% efficiency

61
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,539
at that twenty two thousand dollar mark

62
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,159
plasmas last about 40,000 hours and LEDs

63
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,189
are about fifty thousand dollars but

64
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,419
still maintaining 90% so LEDs it's kind

65
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,889
of important there that look at

66
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:47,169
high-pressure sodium is only fifty

67
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,689
thousand only five thousand degree at

68
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:52,349
fifty thousand so ten times as long for

69
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,520
the LED for only a 5% more degradation

70
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,590
so high pressure setting this is five

71
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,830
thousand hours knots will be 95%

72
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,539
efficient LEDs 50,000 hours and still

73
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,360
operating 90% efficiency

74
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:06,280
so again cost comes into play the

75
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,250
spectrum that they're producing member

76
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,770
t5 for us it's not good for flowering is

77
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,590
a lack penetration they can last a long

78
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,230
time so very important to keep an idea

79
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,420
what the rated life is depending on what

80
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:24,000
light source that you use because that

81
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:24,000
may impact the cost over the long term
