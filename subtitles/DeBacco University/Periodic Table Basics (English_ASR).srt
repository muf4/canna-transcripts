1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay here where I'm going to some of the

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,359
basics of the periodic table now just

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:07,679
looking at this kind of example periodic

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,190
table in front of us we see a lot of

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:14,489
numbers a lot of colors and every number

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:16,800
in color has a reason behind it look

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,509
first for a key in this case that you'd

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,609
be right here you can see where the

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,710
atomic mass is provided to us the

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,980
chemical symbol the name the electron

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,330
configuration the atomic number

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,460
oxidation states so on and so forth for

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,308
each of the elements also see further

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,590
color coding here to get into some of

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,308
the families where the noble gases are

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,320
located here the metalloids so again

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:43,890
everything here is well organized and

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
for a reason so P right table let's

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,609
break this word down just initially

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,939
periodic means occurring in intervals

21
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:54,210
and a table is simply a set of data

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,558
systematically displayed so why spend

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,109
time on the periodic table

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,238
well properties of the elements repeat

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,820
in a periodic way this is a very

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,969
important tool for chemistry it also

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,010
allows us to determine or infer

28
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,489
information about elements that we may

29
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,560
not know a whole lot about we know for

30
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,188
example in one particular family how one

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,740
behaves

32
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,019
we've gotta infer how others within that

33
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:23,579
same family behave because of this

34
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:25,079
intervals that occur Perik table basics

35
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,079
elements are arranged by atomic number

36
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,509
and a typical box contains here where is

37
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,158
in calcium as an example the atomic

38
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,780
number which remembers the number of

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,609
protons the atomic symbol C a remember

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,239
it's capital C lowercase a that's

41
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:41,069
important

42
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,408
that stands for calcium which is the

43
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,969
elements name and the atomic mass which

44
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,978
is technically the average atomic mass

45
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,728
which is the reason why is is carried

46
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:53,938
out to a decimal see also here are

47
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:55,228
magnesium and J's magnesium we have the

48
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,959
atomic number of two the number of

49
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,968
protons which is 12 the atomic mass

50
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,459
which is protons plus neutrons so in

51
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:03,809
this case we know we have 12 protons

52
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:07,408
therefore that must be 12 neutrons in

53
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,840
our oxidation state which this +2 means

54
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,489
that we know there's 12 protons protons

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,129
have a positive charge a lot of times

56
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,469
have a negative charge there

57
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:18,799
has to be 10 electrons because you have

58
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:20,750
this plus 2 charge 12 positive charges

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,890
10 negative charges will leave us with a

60
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:28,250
positive 2 as result now continuing on

61
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:32,059
our in our periodic table the periods

62
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,830
are horizontal rows so Row 1 Row 2 or 3

63
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,810
both floors this also could be referred

64
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,030
to as period 1 period to period 3 in

65
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,150
period 4 and so on it's important to

66
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,129
remember period 1 or Row 1 contains

67
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,289
hydrogen and helium as we see here in

68
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,789
here so when students go through and

69
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:49,159
they want to count either carbon or

70
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:52,429
nitrogen or oxygen little mistakenly say

71
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,939
that to Row 1 remember this is all Row 2

72
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,939
Row 1 is only contains hydrogen and

73
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:02,109
helium this is all these elements are

74
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:04,909
part of Row 2

75
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,550
now groups are vertical columns also

76
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:09,409
potentially refer to as families let's

77
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,410
see here these vertical means they're

78
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:14,659
colored cell so this is a group which is

79
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:17,539
a vertical column which is also referred

80
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:22,430
to as a family we see them color-coded

81
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:23,870
easily here now is there some

82
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,310
interactive periodic tables that we've

83
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,680
added a couple Ling's that you're

84
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,960
welcome to check out a lot of great

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,730
websites to help explain light of

86
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,530
research certain elements that provided

87
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:36,679
the couple provide you with a couple of

88
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,689
links here that you can access remember

89
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,150
in the description is where you can find

90
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:42,740
links to all the slides the

91
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,180
classification of the elements there's

92
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,580
three basic classifications

93
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,390
there's metals which is the vast

94
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,290
majority of the periodic table here

95
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:53,629
nonmetals which is located in this

96
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:56,030
region and then metalloids just kind of

97
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,759
have properties sharing kind of both

98
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,860
metals and nonmetals so your metalloids

99
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:04,759
are located here may separate the

100
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,350
nonmetals from the metals now the metals

101
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,129
in general occupy the left side of the

102
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:11,329
periodic table they have luster or shiny

103
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,310
basically cells at room temperature

104
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,310
except H G which is the abbreviation for

105
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,798
mercury ductile which is means the

106
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,048
ability be brought into wires we see

107
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,699
here this is with copper and valuable

108
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,620
just building a hammered into sheets

109
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,409
they're excellent conductors of heat

110
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,379
electricity

111
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,850
they tend to form positive ions so in

112
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:33,579
general if you're an element that's

113
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:38,020
classified as a metal odds are you share

114
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:40,750
many of these properties in contrast if

115
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,399
you're a nonmetal again located kind of

116
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,860
in the region over here in the periodic

117
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,109
table they occupy the right side they're

118
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,939
generally gases or brittle solids they

119
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,830
have a dull looking kind of appearance

120
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:54,069
and they are poor conductors of heat

121
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:56,649
electricity reminds the only liquid at

122
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:59,319
room temperature and they tend to form

123
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:01,839
negative ions so while most of them are

124
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,099
located in this region here I don't want

125
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,250
you to forget about this one that's

126
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,340
located over on the far side over there

127
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:14,230
this is hydrogen this is also classified

128
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:16,689
as a nonmetal or metalloids located

129
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,970
right here this be the yellow elements

130
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:23,439
in this particular periodic table as

131
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,880
presented and just go back for a second

132
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,519
the metalloids kind of share properties

133
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,620
that border both metals and nonmetals

134
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,819
they're not there's been a lot of time

135
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,740
at least in this lecture on those now

136
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:38,139
the families of elements elements of the

137
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,629
same family or group share structural

138
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,740
and chemical behavior characteristics

139
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,029
these are the families I'm going to go

140
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,030
over and you'll see if they're organized

141
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:48,639
into these nice columns this large block

142
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:50,799
here is a transition elements they're

143
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,379
considered the same general family here

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,879
so starting with the first one alkali

145
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,699
metals they're soft highly reactive

146
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,290
metals usually stored under oil or

147
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,360
kerosene to prevent their interaction

148
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,819
with air in water they are acting

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,100
vigorously with water produces potassium

150
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:08,649
Billy producing fire when just added to

151
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,000
water they oxidize readily in the air

152
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:12,129
and they're good conductors of

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,069
electricity it's important remember that

154
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,259
Group one is alkali metals in the often

155
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:21,430
it confuses the second group swimmer

156
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:23,589
group one alkali metals these alkali

157
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,780
metals have one valence electrons

158
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,719
there's a zoom in of those they will

159
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,729
lose an electron very easily and when

160
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,030
electron is lost metal gains is stable

161
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,710
nonreactive noble gas electron

162
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:38,439
configuration for right now I just don't

163
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:40,269
they tend to lose an electron so lithium

164
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,000
tends a plus 1 charge

165
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:45,849
as is rubidium as as francium as does

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,189
potassium all these are Group one alkali

167
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,160
metals

168
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:52,420
now group two alkaline earth metals easy

169
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,880
way to remember that these are Group two

170
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:58,509
is there's two words alkaline earth

171
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:00,759
so just alkaline metals these your

172
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,370
magnesium's strontium is your calcium

173
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,709
czar harder denser stronger higher

174
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,379
melting points than those Group one

175
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:10,509
alkali metals they are reactive but not

176
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,759
quite as reactive as Group one and they

177
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:16,569
tend to lose two electrons to gain and

178
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,969
more stable of child configuration group

179
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:21,040
3 through 12 are the transition metals

180
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,730
they're not as reactive as Group one and

181
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,879
to huge variety but all are shiny in

182
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,620
nature they form multiple ions they also

183
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,230
include inner transition elements and

184
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,509
rare earth elements so all these are

185
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:38,259
generally classified as our transition

186
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:41,709
metals continuing on along the periodic

187
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,730
table group 17 and here most reactive

188
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,889
nonmetals

189
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,870
they're called the halogens they combine

190
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:50,349
easily with metals especially alkali

191
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,870
metals it's seven valence electrons one

192
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,840
short less stable octet they tend to

193
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,209
gain an electron to become stable so

194
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,239
these 10 inform is negative one I am

195
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,589
they send form a positive one ion they

196
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,389
send from a negative one file hydrogen's

197
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:09,459
kind of on its own there it's the most

198
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,199
common element in the universe its

199
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,419
chemical family by itself is it behave

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,459
so differently it reacts with most other

201
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,500
elements rarely found in the free state

202
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:22,180
in nature and has one valence electron

203
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,620
here as you see now the Hindenburg was

204
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,509
filled with hydrogen's very reactive

205
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:31,120
with oxygen gas helium not he helium is

206
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:34,059
used in blimps today it's much less

207
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,740
reactive than hydrogen to reduce the

208
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:40,000
chance of explosions in fire

209
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,159
lastly here just touching on some of the

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,889
major element families within the

211
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,579
periodic table are the noble gases group

212
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:50,830
18 is all the way on the right-hand side

213
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,889
they have a very low reactivity they

214
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,420
have a filled valence shell SNP level

215
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:58,119
the highest principle energy levels are

216
00:08:55,419 --> 00:09:00,548
also full very stable electron

217
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:03,009
configuration as a result it introduced

218
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:05,428
in signs weather balloons airships such

219
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:09,579
as blimps as you see here on neon sign

220
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:12,759
neon is a noble gas as is helium xenon

221
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:15,818
lights typically found in cars very

222
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,589
bright as in noble gas it's very low

223
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:19,858
reactivity we can add electricity to it

224
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,850
and it glows instead of exploding

225
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,528
hopefully this was a good general

226
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,209
overview of the periodic table so you

227
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:27,188
can develop a better understanding of

228
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:29,338
just why it's organized the way that it

229
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:29,338
is
