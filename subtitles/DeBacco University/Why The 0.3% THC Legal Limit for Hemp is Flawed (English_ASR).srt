1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
in this debaco university video i want

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,160
to go over something that many people

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,320
probably recognize the 0.3 thc legal

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,120
level between the distinction between

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,160
marijuana and hemp however and i'm going

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,719
to talk about why that 0.3 thc legal

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,640
limit for hemp is technically flawed

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,479
looking at the original data

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,760
that was used as part of the study as

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,760
well as some new data so join me on this

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,760
video

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
[Music]

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,439
all right this is something many growers

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,159
are very well aware of 0.3 over or under

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,000
that level for thc creates a major

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,519
different distinguish in their end

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,280
product but let's go over why that

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,359
number is actually flawed

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,960
so first off this is the original

20
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,799
research article it was published in

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,920
1976 i give you the link here and

22
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,479
information i'm going to pull out

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
certain experts from that article so we

24
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,640
can take a look at that a little bit

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,558
more detail but this is the kind of you

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,519
can trace it all back to this original

27
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,560
article why we have that 0.3 th2 level

28
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,599
and we're going to talk about why it's

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,040
flawed

30
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,759
so first off that 0.3 thc legal limit

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
this is the level that is the make or

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,239
break point if a canvas plan is to be

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,559
classified as either hemp or marijuana

34
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,079
this can be the determining factor to

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,118
basically determine if the plant

36
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,359
material can be sold or is a federal

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,040
crime at least in the united states so

38
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,359
how did this number come to be the

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
standard what made them choose this

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,599
particular thc level

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,118
well a story behind the number and

42
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,798
here's kind of the great distinguishing

43
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,478
factor is everything is cannabis whether

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,200
we're talking about hemp marijuana here

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,719
since 0.3 thc limit is so well

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,118
established looking into the supporting

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,478
literature to how it came about reveals

48
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,719
a very interesting story i'm going to

49
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,118
show that here the entire basis for this

50
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,478
set point is based off only one article

51
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,879
the one cited earlier and i'll talk

52
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,078
about so that makes reviewing the data

53
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,280
much easier we don't have a ton of

54
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,438
articles to look at we have one

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,040
particular one to investigate however

56
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,079
once we do this investigation the

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,640
details might be a bit shocking to you

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
so first off here's the um excerpt from

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,159
the article

60
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,919
i'm going to have different quotes from

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,239
that article here i'm going to highlight

62
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,000
certain points from that so first off it

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,759
will be noted that we

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,680
and we so who is we talking about well

65
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,000
this is the two people responsible for

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,239
the publication of the article ernest

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,959
small and um arthur john conquist uh we

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
is

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,479
both of them and one's from the um

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,199
ernest small is from the biosystemics

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,238
research institute agriculture in canada

72
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,079
particularly ottawa canada and

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,480
arthur john was from the new york

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,480
botanical gardens so this article is

75
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,560
only composed of two scientists or

76
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,280
authors so it's not saying that only two

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,920
people can't produce a quality work but

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,400
the research base is certainly smaller

79
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,399
than one would assume for this me only

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,959
article really being utilized i also

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,560
want to just make note that these uh two

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,560
individuals were not the ones that put

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,039
this into the law they were merely the

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,519
ones that published this article others

85
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,840
then chose to use this article as the

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,640
sole source for the implementation of

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,200
their laws and rulings so we is

88
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,919
referring to two scientists

89
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,598
uh then part two we arbitrarily adopt so

90
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,199
arbitrarily adopted we see that in a

91
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,839
scientific article

92
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,479
can be a little uh concerning there so

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
arbitrarily means in a way that is based

94
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,719
on chance rather than being planned or

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,158
based on reason and adopt is to accept

96
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,639
or start to use something new so roughly

97
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,280
translated 0.3 percent thc level is

98
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,439
based on chance more than reason and

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,799
will be used starting now and now is in

100
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,639
1976 the year the article was published

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,200
so just keep that in mind

102
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,000
but there's even more to this as we

103
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,639
continue to investigate further

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,878
so uh let's look a little bit further

105
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,598
down in the article arbitrary nodes

106
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,759
adopt that 0.3 percent delta 9 thc

107
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,919
concentration on a dry basis in young

108
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,719
vigorous leaves

109
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,518
so the flower concentration was not even

110
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,319
considered only the young vigorous

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,439
leaves of relatively in quotes mature

112
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,040
plants so i'm not exactly sure you know

113
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,279
what their degree of maturity is are we

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,120
talking about this uh degree of maturity

115
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,959
kind of over here we're talking about

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
this degree of maturity over here we

117
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,560
could see there's distinct visual

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
differences there

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
the key part here is they were looking

120
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,280
at the vigorous leaves is what they were

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,720
measuring for tft content not the actual

122
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,079
flower

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
so going on a little bit further in the

124
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,439
article as well

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,439
those young upper leaves so upper leaves

126
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,959
are the source of plate material tested

127
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,519
when it comes to testing final product

128
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,478
nowadays the final product that is being

129
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,639
tested is the dry flour

130
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,800
not the leaves so we're basing our

131
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,319
information on an article that was

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,400
testing the leaves not the actual flower

133
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,199
components there so that's a

134
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,319
major difference i'm in distinction

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
there

136
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,918
so this brings apart another article

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
here which is unrelated to the ruling

138
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,839
but i want to kind of bring this into

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
light in this discussion this is an

140
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,679
article published in 2018 you can find

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,519
all the information here i'm going to

142
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,319
pull about some information from this

143
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,399
one

144
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,800
so they were looking at the accumulation

145
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,719
of the delta 9 concentrations we just

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,160
saw here we're using for our laws

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,639
articles based on testing the leaves

148
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
well accumulation delta 9 and 2 canvas

149
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,680
varieties here

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,199
sour willy and

151
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
bonita tree

152
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,000
at days posted here so they're looking

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
at the thc concentration of the flower

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,360
versus the leaf and we could see that

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,478
the flower is notably higher than the

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
leaf concentration so panels a and c

157
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,279
these two

158
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,560
right below me right there report

159
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,038
averages

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,120
with a total of three plants delta nine

161
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,199
two levels in flora samples is the solid

162
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,199
line and leaf samples is the dotted line

163
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
this does show some of the variability

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
b and d

165
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,000
what is the two panels that are

166
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,599
basically below me right now i'll report

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
the delta nine and the leaves are fluoro

168
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,240
samples from the

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,439
from the

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,199
top of the plant in the bottom of the

171
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,519
plant so as we know higher up in the

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,280
plant you can have higher levels lower

173
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,839
where they're not getting quite as much

174
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,159
light intensity there can be lower delta

175
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,359
9 levels so let's take this even a step

176
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,960
further here

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
let's look at some of the actual data

178
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,079
and i'm going to have to make myself

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
kind of small here so i want to

180
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,959
completely disappear on you but i'm just

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,800
going to put myself right in the middle

182
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,038
here but on

183
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,038
the side over here so we're looking at

184
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,959
leaf cannabinoid content in cannabis

185
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,719
plants called vein and greenhouse

186
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,560
so draw your attention here to the

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
column only on the left this is looking

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,918
at the delta 9 concentration of the

189
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
actual leaves

190
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,758
here we're looking on this other one

191
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
over here is the inflorescence for the

192
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,800
flower we're looking at the delta 9

193
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,279
concentration

194
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,478
across many different varieties here now

195
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,519
the lowest level of delta 9 thc here is

196
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:05,279
3.03 percent

197
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,038
and the highest level here in the leaves

198
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,519
is

199
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,680
2.69 with a little variability there so

200
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,240
and we can see much lower again leaves

201
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,918
compared to actual flower you can see a

202
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,598
great distinction

203
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,799
in the different concentrations and

204
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,639
again these are the same varieties we're

205
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,918
mixed up here because they're ordered

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,319
based on delta nine thc levels

207
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,719
so direct quote from this article now

208
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,280
the more updated one they were looking

209
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,960
at uh delta nine thc levels in the leaf

210
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,918
tissues were generally at least tenfold

211
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,680
lower

212
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,279
uh compared to that

213
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,038
of the actual you know inflorescence

214
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,239
there is some variability as expected

215
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,159
but in general tenfold lower

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,720
concentration thc levels in the leaves

217
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,639
compared to the flowers based on this

218
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,520
data remember that original article was

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,038
testing the leaves not actually even the

220
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,758
flowers

221
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,680
so we're looking at you know why the 0.3

222
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,120
thc legal limit for him is flawed you

223
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,598
know what's the real basis behind that

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,280
and hopefully this data and information

225
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,000
brings that to light that there's

226
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,399
current regular regulation of 0.3 thc is

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,399
the federal limit but this is based on

228
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,239
data known not to be represented of

229
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,079
practice the original article is

230
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
arbitrary selected that level for

231
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,399
testing for this is based on the leaves

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,399
which are shown to be at least a tenfold

233
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,159
lower than the flowers so currently

234
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,359
flowers are tested and the percentage of

235
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,400
thc to determine the classification is

236
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,879
based on data generated at random and

237
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,120
actually from leaf tissue so how does

238
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,519
this really make any sense is kind of

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,080
how you bring that apart that just it's

240
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,719
basically a flawed value

241
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,158
so if i take this another step forward

242
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,040
with the data presented this would

243
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,838
support the federal limit of 0.3

244
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,599
uh percent thc level to going up to a

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,600
three percent tc level from the actual

246
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,278
flower well let's maybe ten times the

247
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,278
current level based on the data it would

248
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,200
suggest this would be representative of

249
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,439
what's being tested the flower compared

250
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,360
to the current rules article based on

251
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,560
the testing of the leaves there if we

252
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519
were to take the original article that

253
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,439
was testing the leaves and set that 0.3

254
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,560
level with the flower typically being

255
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,480
ten percent more well ten times greater

256
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,479
three percent uh would be the actual

257
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,159
flower concentration

258
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
now why would three percent uh what

259
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,919
would this allow you know what if if we

260
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
did you know go up to three percent in

261
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,079
the actual flower what would this allow

262
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,079
well the major advantage would be offer

263
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,278
is a more reasonable threshold to

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,600
increase the amount of potential

265
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,240
cannabis types that can be used as

266
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,080
hemp-based production 0.3 percent thc

267
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,080
level really limits

268
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
the gene pool that a lot of growers have

269
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
access to this would reduce the current

270
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,278
limits on cbd production as to increase

271
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,359
levels of cbd often thc will have some

272
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,120
degree of increase as well in the plant

273
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,519
research could be conducted on low level

274
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,799
thc for potential interaction benefits

275
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,039
with cbd and terpenes though i do end

276
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,719
with the end point here

277
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,278
that i do want to just sorry over here

278
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
is caution should be taken for any user

279
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,799
of any new product that will enter the

280
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,800
body at any level but if we're going to

281
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,479
use that original article and really

282
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,000
look at it that was testing the leaves

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
we want to expand that out to the flower

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,039
with the research i showed it's ten

285
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,278
percent more so that would support a

286
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,120
three percent thc limit not saying

287
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,480
that's the ideal limit to choose i just

288
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
wanted to provide everyone with

289
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,200
background information on exactly where

290
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,440
that 0.3 percent thc level was derived

291
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,320
from and why that number is actually

292
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,320
flawed
