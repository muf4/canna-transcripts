1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,258
okay here we're a look at something

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,059
you're probably have heard of before and

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,750
are familiar with but may not fully

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:12,359
understand and that's the topic of pH we

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,839
might be familiar with the pH scale from

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,480
zero to fourteen acids are the lower end

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,579
bases at the higher end neutral is seven

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,719
which is pure water there's certain

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,028
indicators that will turn different

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,089
colors based on pH we want to try to

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:30,028
understand it for molecular level now so

12
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,519
first off to start pH what does that

13
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:35,759
even stand for it equals the potential

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,829
of hydrogen the scale is logarithmic

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,250
meaning it's not linear we're going to

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,280
see what impact each of these pH numbers

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,340
mean it's used to determine the acidity

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,649
or basicity of a water based on an

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,469
aqueous solution there's also something

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,948
called Poh which is the potential for

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,710
hydroxide so potential for hydrogen pH

22
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,920
that's referring to hydrogen here

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:07,079
hydroxide is Oh H this is the opposite

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,570
of pH essentially pH plus Poh equals 14

25
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,438
that's our 0 to 14 scale so if we take a

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:16,709
pH at the bottom here of 7 7 plus 1

27
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:19,978
equals 14 well 7 plus 7 is 14 so the pH

28
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:22,589
is 7 in this case the Poh is also 7

29
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,688
however anywhere else is where it starts

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,900
to get a difference something we may

31
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:29,728
consider an acid for example pH of 2

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,930
kind of rendering a near stomach acid

33
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:36,478
very acidic very strong acid pH of 2

34
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,680
that same substance with a Poh of 12

35
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:43,140
because 2 plus 12 will give us 14 sandy

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,079
we look at a basic solution here pH of

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,159
10 it's gonna the Poh of 4 because again

38
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,349
10 plus 4 is 14 continuing out of our

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,140
acids and bases an acid is a substance

40
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,718
that increases the hydrogen ion

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,849
concentration in a solution so our

42
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:04,500
assets here our pH of 0 to just under

43
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:07,199
700 chloric acid lemon juice grapefruit

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,500
juice tomato juice usually soft drink

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,959
urine saliva coffee soda vinegar all of

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,979
these are examples of acids I try to put

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,280
here is as the

48
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:20,759
each decreases as we get more acidic

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,390
here as this decreases the hydrogen ions

50
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:27,239
will increase so these stronger pH is

51
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:31,919
these lower pH levels love higher higher

52
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,780
concentration of hydrogen ions bases any

53
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,628
substance that reduces the hydrogen ion

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,128
concentration in the solution is a base

55
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:40,919
some bases reduce hydrogen ions directly

56
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:43,199
by accepting hydrogen ions examples of

57
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,578
basic solutions here there just happened

58
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,598
to be at the top of the baking soda

59
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:51,030
picture on 19.5 bleaches drain cleaners

60
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,969
long is seawater is actually slightly

61
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,439
basic these are examples of solutions

62
00:02:53,969 --> 00:03:00,389
that are basic the pH scale as I said

63
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,789
the pH is an aqueous solution of the

64
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,250
hydrogen ion concentration times the

65
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,500
hydroxide concentration equals 10 to the

66
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,568
minus 14th here this measures the degree

67
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,120
of X acidity from that zero before to

68
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:14,310
the scale in relation to biology most

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,340
biological fluids are in the pH range of

70
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,199
6 to 8 in each pH unit represents a

71
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,769
10-fold difference

72
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,798
the scale is a logarithmic a small

73
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,079
change in pH actually indicates a

74
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,439
substantial change in hydrogen ion and

75
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:34,409
hydroxide ion concentrations so what

76
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:39,439
does that look like look right over here

77
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:43,019
for example well looking at pH of 1 our

78
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:46,199
hydronium ion our hydrogen ion is point

79
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,629
1 we go one point we notice we move that

80
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,518
decimal point one point to the last we

81
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,918
go another pH point well we have to move

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,299
that another tenfold so we can see that

83
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,519
this is a lot of rennes and that linear

84
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,919
it's a logarithmic you have this massive

85
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,230
increase in a change in the correlation

86
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,859
of pH values to hydrogen ion

87
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,840
concentrations so as from 3 to 5 you

88
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:11,189
know it's only ones only to 2 pH

89
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,620
different to this right so they page

90
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:16,430
difference of two well remember we're

91
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:21,329
moving it 10 fold each time so 10 a

92
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:24,478
hundred times more acidic as pH 3 to pH

93
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,400
5 there's something called strong acids

94
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,990
and strong bases strong acids and bases

95
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,538
completely dissolved in water

96
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,860
see here HCL divided dissolving

97
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,139
completely into hydrogen ions and

98
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,729
chloride ions sodium hydroxide same they

99
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,069
are into sodium ions and hydroxide ions

100
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:40,560
in contrast to that which we called weak

101
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,629
acids in a weak bases and these

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,788
dissociate only partially and kind of

103
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,379
are irreversible so if we go back to the

104
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:49,560
strong acids will notice that the arrow

105
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,629
goes away here we have this kind of

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,740
state of equilibrium there's going this

107
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,329
way and these are kind of slipping back

108
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,370
these hydrogen ions are binding and

109
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:58,168
going back and forth this is an example

110
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,389
of a weak acid and this is a weak base

111
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:02,549
it's going back and forth it doesn't

112
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,300
just go to completion in one way and

113
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:09,509
completely dissociate so water is both

114
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,728
an acid and a base which seems initially

115
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,620
a little confusing well if we take a

116
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:16,168
strong acid such as hydrochloric acid

117
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,788
and add it to the same concentration of

118
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,889
the base in this case sodium hydroxide

119
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:24,149
we actually get it's called a double

120
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:26,250
replacement we get water and salt we get

121
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,929
in salt water basically from a very

122
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,848
strong acid a very strong base the

123
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,750
reason why it's both an acid and the

124
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:35,310
base as we see it's in equilibrium here

125
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,968
h2o is going back and forth between

126
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,129
hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions now

127
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:44,038
ideally in pure water so being even kind

128
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:46,620
of split doesn't give us a pH of 7 as we

129
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,589
increase the hydrogen ions we then

130
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:53,120
create an acidic solution so you can see

131
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:56,519
here's our H HOH is the same as h2o

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,560
here's our chloride from here here's our

133
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,750
sodium this is kind of giving you an

134
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,939
idea of how things these bonds can

135
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:07,379
switch places give us very different end

136
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:09,389
substances the pH scale pH scales the

137
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,000
concentration of hydrogen ions in a

138
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:15,360
given substance pH equals the negative

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,189
log of hydrogen ions so we see here at

140
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,680
pH of 7 we have an equal number of

141
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,430
hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as we

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,370
increase the acidity unity hydrogen ion

143
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,050
percent is vastly increasing just the

144
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,000
same opposite will happen if we increase

145
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,120
the basicity

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,339
the hydroxide ions will increase here

147
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,158
see it stays in a nice box and that

148
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,729
house always comes to equal 14 you take

149
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:43,430
our pH and editor Poh

150
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,439
now loving the problem here so how much

151
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,829
greater is the hydrogen ion

152
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:52,310
concentration in a solution with pH 2 in

153
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:54,439
a solution with pH 6 so we're looking at

154
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,060
hundred ion concentration we have our pH

155
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:02,719
is let's go through how we're going to

156
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:06,879
solve this so the answer here is a pH of

157
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,310
2 has a hydrogen ion concentration of

158
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,279
1/100 mole our pH of 6

159
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,709
high denying constant of 1 times 10 to

160
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:20,959
the minus 6 so we'll notice it's a much

161
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:22,729
smaller number 1 1 millions here so how

162
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,319
do we get this well by using the log

163
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,259
function you need a calculator to do

164
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,110
this you can do a couple examples here

165
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,810
we have 10 to the minus 2 that's what

166
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,090
the 2 is indicating the 6 is to the

167
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,620
minus 6 and we can see that the

168
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:43,009
difference between these two numbers is

169
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:46,100
10,000 times greater to to 6 so when

170
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:51,259
people say up H of 2 or 6 well it's

171
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,960
still on acid 2 2 6 2 3 4 5 6 oh well

172
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,000
it's only like four ish different pH

173
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,060
units it's not that much different it's

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,620
actually ten thousand times greater

175
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,780
hydrogen ion concentration at page two

176
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,379
compared to 6 so you can see it makes a

177
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:08,029
large difference buffers are very

178
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,019
important there are substances that

179
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:13,539
resist a change in pH buffers help organ

180
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:16,759
embody fluids in a narrow range

181
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,400
necessary for life the combinations of

182
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,170
hydrogen ions acceptors and donors form

183
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,959
a solution of weak acids and bases

184
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:27,500
that's buffering the solution this works

185
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:29,870
by accepting hydrogen ions from solution

186
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,579
when they're in excess and donating

187
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,440
hydrogen ions when they have been

188
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:36,649
depleted so what's happening with a

189
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,570
buffer it's kind of helping reduce the

190
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,699
large swings that may occurrence

191
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,129
Ellucian you see distilled water almost

192
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,379
no buffering solution we add a little

193
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,360
bit of volume of NaOH added to add like

194
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:50,360
one drop and we see the pH jump up

195
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,460
drastically in buffered solutions we see

196
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,899
that pH maintained a much more

197
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,509
consistent range

198
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,360
he's only slowly increase that's what a

199
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:02,500
buffer is doing well slowing or reducing

200
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,970
the massive differences or swings pH

201
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,480
it's very important for example for

202
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,029
blood pH or our normal pH is between

203
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,240
seven point three four and seven point

204
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:15,980
three eight pH of seven or seven eight

205
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,440
or getting into the very dangerous

206
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,720
ranges page of six or nine of blood pH

207
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,490
leads to death this is why it's

208
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
important we have buffers to help

209
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,190
maintain this normal pH in this tight

210
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,230
range so that we can allow us to survive

211
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,420
and allow our proteins to function

212
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,279
properly and allow us to be able to

213
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:36,279
carry out our normal bodily functions
