1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
so here I'm going to go over canvas

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,609
cloning procedure which came out to be

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,099
thirteen steps which I know may not be

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,089
the luckiest number but I try to break

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,519
it down easy to fall out to allow a

6
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:17,698
successful cloning procedure so the

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,769
first basic process of this is step one

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,750
and kind of most important is to select

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,210
a healthy plant when a healthy plant

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,009
that's a female at least two months old

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,410
and those young as one month but that's

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,410
kind of pushing it has not been overfed

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,270
nitrogen fertilizer so female at least

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,429
are about two months old in a slapping

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,300
overhead nitrogen fertilizer as that

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,500
limits the rooting process much easier

17
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:43,439
next step you want to cut me want to

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,909
clean this sterilized knife to cut side

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,558
chute that's about three to six inches

20
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,898
long and as a stem diameter about an

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,238
eighth to a quarter inch it can become

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,649
flat or at a 45 degree angle doesn't

23
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,509
mean it to kind of get out of protractor

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,460
and measure exactly that 45-degree angle

25
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,558
that doesn't have a great impact on

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,480
their rooting a 45 degree angle is

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,429
beneficial sticking into immediate it

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,018
will penetrate a little bit easier but

29
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,829
you can kind of do a flat cut doesn't

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,080
have to be perfect 45-degree angle step

31
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,368
three would be a leaf count sometimes

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,170
want to remove some lower leaves may be

33
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,299
necessary to allow enough stem exposure

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,790
we see a bunch of cannabis clones here

35
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,220
to be placed into holding media

36
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,868
this is an aeroponic cloner here the

37
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,090
ending should have at least two sets of

38
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,579
leaves above the media if making many

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,109
clones over a large area a store

40
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,688
recently cut clones in water or high

41
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,769
emanate with minimal light exposure the

42
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:33,839
whole point there is you want to reduce

43
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,908
this stress on it so if you're doing a

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,469
lot of clones like in this situation you

45
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,820
want to immediately get them in an area

46
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,670
that doesn't cause a lot of stress

47
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,589
however the time from cutting to clone

48
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,200
placing into cloning environment should

49
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,670
be kept as short as possible I want to

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,070
reduce that stress or under enough

51
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,810
stress as it is the reason why we want

52
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,008
to remove those lower leaves is you want

53
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,409
to keep in mind that's where the roots

54
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,810
are going to start or initiate from so

55
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,700
reducing that lower leaves allows a more

56
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,570
efficient area for rooting or sticking

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,399
in this case in these foam holders so

58
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,868
for be applying a rooting hormone so

59
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,848
apply chosen reading hormone according

60
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:10,169
to the directions the portion of the

61
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,519
stem where routing needs to be

62
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,699
encouraged and again it's to figure that

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,350
nice moment potion proportionately

64
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:18,479
personally I have used Kleenex gel and

65
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,419
produce great success any other routing

66
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,049
jela that I've used sticks really nice

67
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,959
it produces great results for me growing

68
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,430
media so have great media ready to go

69
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,170
for an easy transfer you might want to

70
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,240
add a heating mat to slightly elevate

71
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:36,059
the temperature above ambient should be

72
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,070
around that 70 to 75 degrees won't

73
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,979
encourage root development you go much

74
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,539
higher than that some growers acted only

75
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,560
up to like 70 it's good then 90

76
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,019
fahrenheit must be better

77
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,020
Manny's not good root zones really

78
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,209
rarely get that hot and it doesn't allow

79
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,340
for efficient root development so 70

80
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,219
degrees is just fine want to also using

81
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,530
propagation mix to help reduce the

82
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,330
chance of having air pockets I'm going

83
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,169
to keep good moisture contact with that

84
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,880
newly stuck the stem the stick so if

85
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,679
you're sticking into media first wake a

86
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,349
Dibble hole like a little puncture hole

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,150
could be done with a sharpened pencil

88
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,769
into Rockwell santos mixture or they're

89
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,510
fine substrate to reduce the chance of

90
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,489
breaking the stem when you go to place

91
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:19,709
that in there using the clone machine

92
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,689
they have collars ready and in place

93
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,349
have machine running and ready to be

94
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,669
loaded

95
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,229
don't take your cuttings and then get

96
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,819
the clone machine ready make sure that's

97
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:28,109
ready ahead of time so you can put the

98
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,669
collar on them and stick them right in

99
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,530
it's a little bit more advances here

100
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,059
route already popping out there but it

101
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,479
gives you just an idea of that quick

102
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,129
easy transfer i'll cutting the leaves

103
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,899
some growers will go through and cut all

104
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,209
the ends of the leaves take kind of trim

105
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,620
them all down to reduce the area and

106
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,750
transpiration rate i personal dont

107
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,340
advise this personally i discourage this

108
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,930
only because it increases the wound

109
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,000
sites and can increase potential for

110
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,629
disease if the clinic environment has

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,959
high humidity the leaf cutting is

112
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:59,639
unneeded really it can also cause some

113
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,500
other issues with the plants kind of

114
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,048
growing out and kind of healing up those

115
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,310
areas if you have enough of a humid

116
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,610
environment you shouldn't need to cut

117
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,079
the leaves humidity as I mentioned very

118
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,360
important when a place to clones in a

119
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,370
high human environment 95-plus

120
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,410
if taking multiple cuttings be sure to

121
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,350
label them in some way there were color

122
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,479
coding labeling different trays keep in

123
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,890
mind that some labeling methods

124
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,469
especially if you're using certain

125
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,550
labels they may fade in the Sun so just

126
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,370
keep that in mind and keep an eye on

127
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,810
them make sure you're not

128
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,689
using always always the pink in the

129
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,769
light blue those may fade over time

130
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,449
watering them in really heavy can help

131
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:36,009
increase humidity and then placing it we

132
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,639
need know if you're looking at it right

133
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,259
now consistency is key you want to keep

134
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,660
the clintons evenly moist the girls

135
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,819
consistent consistency and to avoid

136
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,830
excessively wet in dry pockets when a

137
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,839
nice fine mist over the area over that

138
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,909
leaf surface and growing in a little bit

139
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,769
larger of an area you can have a monitor

140
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,090
here to make sure you're maintaining a

141
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:59,889
certain percent of the environment

142
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:02,349
clothes perform best in 18 and 24 hours

143
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,120
of light diffused light provides energy

144
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,729
for growth but produces a chance than

145
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,079
the burning this tender foliage direct

146
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:09,909
high density lights not advised

147
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,009
fluorescents are great warm and cool

148
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,530
whites preferred work great for clones

149
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,839
one about 6 to 10 inches away from the

150
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:19,239
clones a high-power light it is high

151
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,369
pressure sodium metal halides from metal

152
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,379
heads can be used that shade cloth

153
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,360
between them or just hang them about

154
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:26,829
five feet away dimmable lights are

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,360
another great source they offer the

156
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:31,659
advantage of changing intestine II as

157
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,729
the clones develop after four days you

158
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,010
can reduce humidity levels to about 85%

159
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:37,659
be accomplished by partially removing

160
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,159
the domes where we do some automatic

161
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,900
misting events you still want that kind

162
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,870
of humid environment we're starting to

163
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:46,598
ease them off from that 95 percent or

164
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,430
higher humidity levels once roots are

165
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:49,719
seen through the media or I've reached

166
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,030
about six inches long they be

167
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,039
transferred to their growing media this

168
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:55,929
can take another from 7 to 21 days and

169
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,228
depending on the environment that you're

170
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,668
growing in some clones may be slower to

171
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:02,199
initially root and those should not be

172
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:03,819
transferred until sufficient roots have

173
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,348
been produced you could see here some

174
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,639
might be on the borderline edge might

175
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:08,709
want to let this go for a couple more

176
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,840
days did that simply take a blocker

177
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,129
tray of clones and progressed them to

178
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,168
the next step treat em is each

179
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,279
individual's to help increasing the

180
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:20,319
higher percent total that will survive

181
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,779
lastly the initial transfer there may be

182
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,538
some color change which is normal due to

183
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:27,129
transplant shock as clones age the light

184
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,779
intensities can be increased in the

185
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:30,788
duration of photo period should be kept

186
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:32,259
consistent so don't panic if you go to

187
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:34,418
transfer them in all this and they get a

188
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,459
little bit lighter in coloration they

189
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:39,668
usually will bounce back if everything

190
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:40,899
else is kept well established and

191
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:42,039
consistent

192
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,569
there was again a problem over

193
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,360
fertilizing and burning their tender

194
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,709
roots of their newly cloned plants

195
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
summarize these thirteen steps I'm all

196
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,459
kind of quickly labeled right here you

197
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,379
can pause the video and take a look at

198
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,149
in more detail with everything they went

199
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:58,228
over to hopefully have a successful

200
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,228
cloning process
