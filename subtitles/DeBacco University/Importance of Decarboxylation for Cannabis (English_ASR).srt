1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,899
and this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,480
going to go over the importance of

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,280
decarboxylation for canvas I'll go over

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,559
a brief introduction of what this

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,959
actually is from a chemical standpoint

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,218
as well as go over scientific study to

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,500
give you some specifics that you can

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,500
look for when going through this process

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:26,699
[Music]

10
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,618
so here's the study there's a research

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,720
article you can find the screenshot of

12
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,340
the first page right here as well as the

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,439
proper citation if you want to look at

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,840
the study in more details I'll provide

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,218
you with a brief overview here so first

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,260
off starting with the very Basics is

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,820
just what is decarboxylation well all

18
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,500
cannabinoids that are contained within

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,899
the trichomes of raw cannabis flour

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,200
consist of canamoids in their acidic

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,239
form and have an extra carboxyl ring or

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,640
group attached to the chain and from a

23
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,919
chemistry standpoint that's a carbon

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,600
with two oxygens and a hydrogen the

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,120
decarboxylation are typically called

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
decarbing is where raw canvas is heated

27
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,679
so that the chemical structure of the

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,200
acid cannabinoids changes to a neutral

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,939
or non-acid form you can also if you

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,340
notice right below me here can also

31
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,739
change invisible appearance we're simply

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,420
breaking off that Bond there through the

33
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,699
process of heat

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,618
so the acidic to neutral form conversion

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,960
and what's going on here well this is

36
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,819
when one states that the climates are in

37
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,618
their acidic form they're referring to

38
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,079
the chemical structure of the compound

39
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,420
itself a cannabinoid that is in its

40
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,819
acidic form has a carboxyl group

41
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,700
attached in the neutral forms where the

42
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,859
carboxyl group simply removed so acid is

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,500
the raw plant material and the neutral

44
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,578
form is a decarboxylated compound and

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,219
how does that look from a structure

46
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:47,758
standpoint here we can see THC a and

47
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,739
cbda and their acid form or their how to

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,420
be found on the raw plate material when

49
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,459
heat is added we could see they both

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,740
convert to their neutral form with the

51
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,259
loss here of carbon dioxide you can see

52
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,938
it also pictured on this side as well

53
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,978
where we see the acidic forms are

54
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,618
considered to be the inactive forms and

55
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,000
then through the Deep carboxyl

56
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:08,280
carboxylation process with heat and time

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,598
you get into the active forms or the

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
neutral forms

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,780
now the chemical structure changes just

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,700
to show that in a little bit more detail

61
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,560
here this transforming of the

62
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,659
cannabinoid acids into their neutral

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,239
forms needs to Simply remove that

64
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,739
carboxyl group there the weak Bond

65
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,039
holding the carboxyl group can be broken

66
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,360
by a combination of heat as well as time

67
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,098
this describes the process of

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,540
decarboxylation because you're removing

69
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,939
our carboxyl group due to high

70
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,098
temperature or combustion the major

71
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,239
difference chemically between the acid

72
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,659
cannabinoids and their neutral

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,300
counterparts is that extra Bond there of

74
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,919
that carboxyl group so known as a

75
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,019
carboxyl group again from a scientific

76
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,179
chemistry standpoint which consists of a

77
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,920
carbon oxygen oxygen hydrogen molecule

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,080
cluster and that's simply what's being

79
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,659
broken off and removed causing the

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,060
conversion from the acidic form to that

81
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,180
neutral form it's also a loss of carbon

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,560
dioxide in the process as shown here

83
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,900
now why do we need to go through this

84
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,039
process why is this even important

85
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,800
um why do we need to go through

86
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,000
carboxylation decarboxylation this

87
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,980
process essentially converts the

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,019
chemicals to an active form by

89
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,780
increasing the body's ability to absorb

90
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,700
and bind the molecules

91
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,860
essentially the body can use the active

92
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:22,619
form carboxylation happens naturally

93
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,060
when the plant material is ignited so

94
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,920
through that heating process through

95
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,199
that combustion process that is a

96
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,419
natural way to add heat through time to

97
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,799
convert the acidic form to that neutral

98
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,839
form

99
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,959
so what's the importance of this process

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,640
you know converting of thca uh versus

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,560
just regular THC so while TTA is

102
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,500
non-psychoactive not decarboxylated form

103
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,500
it's the precursor to THC which is the

104
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,900
which is the decarboxylated form this

105
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,139
does not bind to the CB1 and CB2

106
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,700
receptors just note that thca binds with

107
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,979
other cannabinoid receptors in the

108
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,539
endocannabinoid system so that's why

109
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,959
active is usually like in quotes

110
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,539
although thca poses some therapeutic

111
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,699
effects like anti-inflammatory and

112
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,459
neuroproductive qualities it is not the

113
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,619
most beneficial or is nor is it the

114
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,620
psychoactive form so we're not saying

115
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,780
that thca is you know completely not

116
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,639
able to be utilized by the body but it

117
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,279
doesn't seem like it's as utilized or as

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,379
binds as well to the CB1 and CB2

119
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,478
receptors compared to its neutral form

120
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,339
THC

121
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,500
so what this requires um this

122
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,379
decarboxylation does require heat and

123
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,720
time these are two main catalysts to for

124
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,719
this process to occur drying and curing

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,040
canvas over time will cause a partial

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,780
decarboxylation to occur but the Heat

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,819
and time will speed up that process and

128
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,679
make it more efficient heating of the

129
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,319
cannabinoids to a lower temperature over

130
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,280
time allows economics to be

131
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,560
decarboxylated while preserving the

132
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,839
Integrity of the material typically here

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,699
we're talking about terpenes this is

134
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,859
used so that it can be incorporated into

135
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,600
what is ultimately going to be consumed

136
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,540
you see this kind of like conversion

137
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,300
here we've noticed that TTA is

138
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,680
decreasing the same time THC would be

139
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,240
increasing

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,680
so here's that journal like conversion

141
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,939
graph it's kind of average I have the

142
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,400
picture of the Seesaw here it's kind of

143
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:16,019
that like inverse relationship here and

144
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,779
this shows the theoretical conversion of

145
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,698
the acidic forms of THC and CBD to the

146
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,579
neutral forms notice the inverse

147
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,620
relationship as the amounts change at

148
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,538
the end THC and CBD remain in high

149
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,100
concentrations so what's basically

150
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,959
happening here this lines representing

151
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,759
TTA and you see when that starts to drop

152
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,879
and go down the presence or

153
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,160
concentration of THC increases and the

154
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,019
same thing can be applied to cbda and

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,060
CBD there's that inverse relationship

156
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,379
one's being converted to another

157
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,959
so that's why you're getting kind of

158
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,779
that seesaw-like conversion

159
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,459
now test results before and after

160
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:54,359
decarboxylation canvas flowers are often

161
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,978
tested for both THC as well as thca note

162
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,139
that THC is often found in small

163
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:00,180
percentages in fresh flour because it

164
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,280
has not gone through the Heat and the

165
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,220
time to decarboxylate it and we can see

166
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,619
here here's THC and here's THC a we can

167
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,240
see after that decarboxylation process

168
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,899
we can see that conversion here was a

169
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,460
lot more THC compared to THC a so it's

170
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,038
just important note there in a lot of

171
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,978
times Labs do test for both even in

172
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,418
regular dry flour so that grower can

173
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,120
have an understanding as well as a

174
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:27,180
consumer of that potential conversion to

175
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,699
the amount of desirable cannabinoid

176
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,740
now the best what's the best ecobox and

177
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,680
temperature for CBDs again we're going

178
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,240
to look at CBD as well as THC so there

179
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,978
is some dispute over the exact de

180
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,019
carboxylation temperature for CBD

181
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,699
according to studies however it appears

182
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,839
to be approximately 203 degrees

183
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:47,819
Fahrenheit or 110 degrees Celsius as for

184
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,579
the time frame neither THC nor CBD will

185
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,860
decarboxylate instantaneously at their

186
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,478
precise decarb temperature so it's not

187
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,520
like you hit that temperature and you

188
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,079
get that automatic conversion there is

189
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,418
still a Time factor to take into

190
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,818
consideration a longer period typically

191
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,500
between 40 and 60 Minutes will be

192
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,960
required for that carboxyl group to

193
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,819
break down into water and carbon dioxide

194
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,138
so it's a little bit of a range there to

195
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,280
give you a general idea but it's not

196
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,978
like instantaneous you hit that

197
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,519
temperature and 100 converts there needs

198
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:19,740
to be a duration of time also considered

199
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,478
now don't get decarboxylation

200
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,699
temperatures confused with boiling

201
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,379
points because they are not the same now

202
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,819
boiling points for cannabinoids terpenes

203
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,918
flavonoids have been much more

204
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,840
thoroughly studied than decarboxylation

205
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,459
temperatures boiling points for the

206
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,619
compounds are all provided here in

207
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,258
Fahrenheit and Celsius and here's kind

208
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,579
of more of a pictorial graph here I'm

209
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,800
giving you some some more information

210
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,740
but this is what was provided in the

211
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,660
study these boiling points are not the

212
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,918
same as the carboxylation temperatures a

213
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,720
little bit easier to study a little bit

214
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,639
more published but you have to be aware

215
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,259
of what number you're looking at what

216
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,699
that correlates with

217
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,259
because you want to avoid high

218
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,060
temperatures it's important to keep a

219
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,379
tight temperature control applying

220
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,899
cannabis to various technological

221
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,000
applications while heat is needed to

222
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,219
decarboxylate the acids into the active

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,800
form of cannabinoids our bodies can use

224
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,080
extreme temperatures can destroy many of

225
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,699
these important plant materials that

226
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,060
contribute to positive Health outcomes

227
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,819
such as terpenes if cannabis is heated

228
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,680
above 300 degrees Fahrenheit need to run

229
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,259
you need to run the risk of denaturing

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,579
many important other plant compounds so

231
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,259
it's not just the concept of more heat

232
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:27,180
is better there we have to be careful

233
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,639
with that because there's also comments

234
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,379
that will validate and evaporate at

235
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,418
higher temperatures and this can result

236
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,300
in unpleasant odor as well as an

237
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:38,519
unpleasant taste so too much heat too

238
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,139
much and is going to cause a degradation

239
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,639
of that product

240
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,500
so you simply want to use the minimum

241
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,539
temperature basically to try to preserve

242
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,458
those terpenes it is advisable to keep

243
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,620
the decarboxylation temperatures at a

244
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,599
low point to preserve terpenes as well

245
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,339
as other compounds each individual

246
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,519
terpene may have its own therapeutic

247
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,160
benefits so but this also carries its

248
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,959
own sensitivity to heat if terpenes are

249
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,958
to be stored the temperature in the

250
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,699
range of 203 degrees Fahrenheit should

251
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,439
be maintained there we're not looking at

252
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,778
you know heating up too high start

253
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,940
getting above certain theoretical

254
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:14,100
temperatures and they will break down

255
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,300
and we don't want to lose those terpenes

256
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,839
that we've spent so much time in the

257
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,458
plant growing breaking those down

258
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,580
now maintaining consistent temperature

259
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:26,278
is important so for this process a

260
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,080
digital oven a safe thermometer is

261
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,179
recommended so that the temperature that

262
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,339
works best for the final product can be

263
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,719
continually monitored now if you're

264
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,540
using an oven limit the number of times

265
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,680
you open the door during the

266
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:39,719
decarboxylation process so this will

267
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,879
cause temperature fluctuations and

268
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,980
reduce consistency and total yield of

269
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,299
the decarboxylation process if you're

270
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,680
looking at a graph of the temperatures

271
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,599
you don't want to have these that have

272
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,579
these like large swings in it you want

273
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,959
to have very minimal noise data noise

274
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,940
you want to have a graph that looks more

275
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,039
like this because that will ensure a

276
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,560
more consistent temperature and a more

277
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,360
consistent repeatable process

278
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,399
now speeding up the process what a lot

279
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,500
of people want to do kind of we see here

280
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,839
but just as if you drive too fast that

281
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,820
can have negative effects now the key to

282
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,860
faster decarboxylation is known to be

283
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,680
greater heat and this should be a clear

284
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,720
process unfortunately it's not easy also

285
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,919
speeding up the process can result in a

286
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,839
reduction of the quality of the end

287
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,879
product and we don't want to kind of

288
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,459
avoid we want to avoid that

289
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,778
now cannabis trim trim is what is

290
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,479
removed from the final flower after

291
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:29,639
harvest trim includes sugar leaves bits

292
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,600
of cut off Buds and knocked off tricums

293
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,939
or kief

294
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,680
this portion of the plant is considered

295
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,779
low quality and is usually reserved for

296
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,939
making Edibles hash pre-rolls or simply

297
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,620
just used for extraction the reason why

298
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,019
I mentioned this and Define this is

299
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,578
we're going to see this study uses these

300
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,919
terms so I want you to understand what

301
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,419
this plant material is referring to

302
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,000
now going through the other portion here

303
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,799
the Keith explained when trichomes dry

304
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,179
and break off the plant becomes this

305
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,179
kief product which is kind of what it

306
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,699
looks like it's a popular byproduct of

307
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,759
wheat consumption and is often used for

308
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,620
Edible Creations

309
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,240
has oxidized and lost its freshness when

310
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,759
separated from the plant buds usually

311
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,740
has a darker color than trichomes

312
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,778
ranging from a light gold to kind of a

313
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,480
brown coloration kind of the rendition

314
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:17,399
you see here in this image it has a

315
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,379
powdery appearance and a texture that is

316
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,720
somewhat sticky often less so than

317
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,700
trichomes on the actual bud keep tends

318
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,500
to decarb faster than an intact flower

319
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,660
so keep that in mind when we're looking

320
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,360
at the temperatures and suggestions for

321
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,879
the decarboxylation process

322
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,440
so here's the temperature in times chart

323
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,419
so suggested times for different

324
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,820
temperatures are provided for the type

325
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,679
of cannabinoid either THC or CBD and the

326
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,959
material being decarboxylated is it

327
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,639
flour or is it Kief and we can see here

328
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,338
the temperature range is here the

329
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,220
heating mode the plant material time or

330
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,560
high THC and high CBD a key for hash

331
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,600
time and in canvas oil time is all

332
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,359
provided here so you can see how there

333
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,278
are fluctuations in time based on

334
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,159
temperature they really didn't do a lot

335
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,139
here with this one with the hot oil bath

336
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,600
focus more on the oven and use the

337
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,759
boiling water bath as well here with the

338
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,259
suggested times below you know here's a

339
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,319
link you can definitely pause the video

340
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,919
or search the primary source as well

341
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,300
now THC content does change over time

342
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,099
exposed to different temperatures so the

343
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,338
highest concentration of THC which in

344
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,680
this case was about 15

345
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:28,019
milligrams per gram is obtained when the

346
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,559
material is decarboxylate at 122 degrees

347
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:34,019
Celsius for 27 minutes so we kind of see

348
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,458
the graph provided here and we're

349
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,799
looking at kind of this this one right

350
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,059
here being kind of the ideal for 27

351
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,199
minutes it's kind of lighting up right

352
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,879
here and you'll notice again it doesn't

353
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,740
happen instantaneously it does start to

354
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,019
break down and then it kind of peeks out

355
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,339
and tapers off kind of plateaus we don't

356
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,379
want to run it for too long because we

357
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,260
could get a degradation at that point so

358
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:55,500
that 20 to 27 minutes 27 minutes being

359
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:58,980
suggested by the data presented here

360
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,720
now changes in content here in at least

361
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,759
in percentage of the main cannabinoids

362
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,759
before and after the decarboxylation

363
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,740
process now here's the cannabinoids THC

364
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,679
a and THC the acidic form the neutral

365
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,659
form cbda and CBD CBN and then the

366
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,939
moisture and a total cannabinoids and

367
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,578
we're seeing before decarboxylation the

368
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,820
content again in percentages and we can

369
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,638
notice that thca quite high and then we

370
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,200
see THC being relatively low 30 minutes

371
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,659
of decarboxylation compared to 60

372
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,399
minutes we can see that thca almost

373
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,139
degrades to nothing which as we expect

374
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,379
and it's being converted because it's

375
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,720
simply being converted to THC and we see

376
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,360
the same pattern here for cbda being

377
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,278
converted to CBD and then CBN and then

378
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
moisture there now it's important just

379
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,399
to remember that the acidic forms are

380
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,138
being converted to their biologically

381
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,659
active neutral forms during this process

382
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,339
note that the longer 60 Minutes in this

383
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,919
case basically right below me time

384
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,019
caused a reduction in total cannabinoids

385
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,819
we see that highlighted right here we

386
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:01,440
peaked here 30 minutes

387
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:03,899
at the 30.3 it went down to 27.4 so the

388
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,260
content of cbda before decarboxylation

389
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:10,740
was 0.6 and an hour after deconvection

390
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:13,500
decreased 0.3 and we can see that here

391
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,060
whereas the CBD content before was zero

392
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,919
percent we see that right here and after

393
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,958
30 minutes was increased to one percent

394
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,240
so again we're seeing that time we're

395
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,159
seeing that conversion uh process

396
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,980
because of the Heat and the time from

397
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,078
the acidic form to that neutral form

398
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,278
now I just want you to leave you didn't

399
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,078
want to just leave you with that I want

400
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,000
you to understand that there's other

401
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,219
factors of variability

402
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,620
this isn't just a necessarily a set cut

403
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,120
and dry chemical process the variety of

404
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,799
the Cannabis being used the age

405
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,379
refreshness of the product the equipment

406
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,479
being used in the flower uniformity all

407
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,559
play a role in this decarboxylation

408
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,879
process

409
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,859
so the variety of care is being used

410
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,939
let's just touch on that here for a

411
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,039
moment I'm going to go into each of

412
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,660
these a little bit more detail each type

413
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,159
of cannabis contains different amounts

414
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,139
of ratios or different cannabinoids and

415
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,480
terpenes which impact the optimum

416
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,579
decarboxylation time as well as the

417
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,259
temperature this can also be impacted by

418
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,000
the physical structure of the flower so

419
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,740
take that into consideration

420
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,179
see each cannabinoid and terpene

421
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,980
decarboxylates at different temperatures

422
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,239
knowing what the plant naturally

423
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,060
contains will impact the temperature

424
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,799
protocol that should be implemented now

425
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,838
you're focusing on a type 1 a type 2 a

426
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,519
Type 3 What specific terpenes might be

427
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,519
of high presence in your particular

428
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,039
cultivar variety being used

429
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,139
also age and freshness of the product

430
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,458
there will be noticeable differences in

431
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,799
the final product depending on the age

432
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:34,198
or freshness of the material you start

433
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,899
with this really impacts the amount of

434
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,919
degradation that may occur before

435
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,899
decarboxylation remember the

436
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,439
decarboxylation process only converts

437
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,778
the acidic form from the form to the

438
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,019
bioactive neutral form it does not

439
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,939
create CBD or create the THC molecule

440
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,259
it's a conversion you're taking the A

441
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,959
and you're breaking that the voxel group

442
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:57,059
off that's what you're left with this is

443
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,979
not a creation of a molecule it's a

444
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,719
conversion of a molecule

445
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,920
now also the equipment being used in

446
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,019
this could be a high source of

447
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,819
variability because you want to reduce

448
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,560
that variability and the ability to

449
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,360
maintain precise temperature will have a

450
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,458
direct impact on the total yield

451
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,579
continually monitoring the temperature

452
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:16,799
is also important in oven or other

453
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:18,239
systems such as a cooker slow cooker or

454
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,379
instant cooker is used there will be a

455
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,419
small variability in the cooking

456
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,039
equipment that may affect the final

457
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,319
product and may also affect the

458
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,958
repeatability of your protocol

459
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,820
this is why equipment intended for this

460
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,578
purpose is recommended such as a

461
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,860
decarboxylation jacketed glass reactor

462
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:37,439
or other professional oven they're going

463
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,539
to have more repeatability they're gonna

464
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,279
have less variability but you are going

465
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,439
to pay more for them

466
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,778
and flower uniformity so this is another

467
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,240
Factor Dickens consideration as this can

468
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:50,220
refer to the size but also the density

469
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,259
of the final flower the greater the

470
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,459
consistency of the size and density will

471
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,220
allow for the most consistent

472
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:58,198
decarboxylation process as an extreme

473
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,180
example of fine cannabis or powder kief

474
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,519
will require a much shorter cooking time

475
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:03,719
to prevent burning and denaturing of the

476
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,660
important compounds in the plant

477
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,838
compared to an intact flower if the

478
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,279
flower consistency varies widely and

479
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,599
grinding up the plant material will help

480
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,359
increase the uniformity of the

481
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,980
decarboxylation process or doing runs or

482
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,379
batches of flowers with the same

483
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,900
uniformity will help increase your

484
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,299
ability to have this repeatable and

485
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,900
consistent end result

486
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:29,539
now just some general key points never

487
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,798
just keep in mind that you need to have

488
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,359
higher temperatures

489
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,639
um I'm sorry at higher temperatures

490
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,219
Keith and hash 10 to decarboxylate

491
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,960
faster than dried flowers simply because

492
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,240
of the surface area of more surface area

493
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,819
all ground up there gonna have a greater

494
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,819
chance of that heat penetration High CBD

495
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:50,519
strains tend to have tend to carboxylate

496
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:52,619
a bit slower than those with high THC

497
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,179
content so just having that knowing what

498
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,639
the You're Expecting from your compounds

499
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,220
can help you plan for that in the

500
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,020
protocol process

501
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,120
three main factors with any

502
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,619
decarboxylation it's important

503
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,079
parameters to perform a good

504
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:10,918
decarboxylation are the time or duration

505
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:13,079
the temperature you keep the oven or

506
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,759
heating device at and the quality of

507
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,000
decarboxylation equipment for

508
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,619
consistency as well as repeatability

509
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
so lastly if you just want the basic

510
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,798
suggestions here if you've made it this

511
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,960
far into the video suggestions for

512
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,759
decarboxylation your own cannabis from

513
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,279
the review of the published literature

514
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,740
highest concentration of THC which is

515
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,200
about 15 milligrams per gram is obtained

516
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:38,339
when the material is decarboxylated at

517
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,400
122 degrees Celsius for 27 minutes if

518
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:43,558
you're looking at converting cbda to CBD

519
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,320
a higher temperature is required about

520
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,899
150 degrees Celsius and is suggested

521
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,939
time for about 30 minutes if you're

522
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,980
looking at decarboxylating key for hash

523
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,140
in an oven I bake it for about 10

524
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,019
minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit which

525
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,299
is about 149 degrees Celsius there for

526
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,819
consistency hopefully this gives you a

527
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:05,400
general idea of a really good starting

528
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,599
point as well as other factors to

529
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,700
consider that you may not have

530
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,159
originally thought of to ensure you're

531
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,500
getting the most quality end product

532
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,419
from your starting material but if you

533
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,099
don't have a good grow or good protocols

534
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,980
to begin with you don't have good flour

535
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,959
this will do the best it can but keep in

536
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,058
mind you need to have it in the plant to

537
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,819
be able to decarboxylate it to get that

538
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:28,819
final end product result that you desire
