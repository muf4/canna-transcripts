1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,559
in this debacco University collaboration

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,119
video with Shane from migro we'll be

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,519
investigating how light spectrum can

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,320
impact plants looking at Spectrum versus

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,480
yield as well as Spectrum versus canabo

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,669
production as well as a few other common

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,730
questions so I hope you

8
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,730
[Music]

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,439
enjoy so welcome we've got Shane here

10
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,079
from migro and we're going to be

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,278
discussing a topic that I know gets a

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,479
lot of attention and that's Spectrum

13
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:34,479
when it comes to plant production and

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,599
optimizing those spectrums we're seeing

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,599
new lighting technology come out with

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,280
all sorts of dials and options on it to

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,000
modify and change blue light red light

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,640
and different kind of ratios between

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,960
those so we're going to get into a

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,920
little bit more of the details here

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,000
we've got Shane to help us provide us

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,920
some background for that so looking

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,198
Shane as we're looking at our optimizing

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,559
Spectrum how does this change as the

25
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,439
plant grows you do we want to give the

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,320
plants the same thing the whole time do

27
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,280
do we want to modify things how how

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,760
would we modify it as that plant goes

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,799
from that early stage through the veg

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,600
into flowering

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,159
phase I suppos useful to put a bit of

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,879
perspective here and a few reference

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,880
points for people with regard to

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,719
Spectrum so we take grow sunlight

35
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:22,319
Spectrum what plants have evolved um to

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:25,438
work with you know to absorb um sunlight

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:29,559
Spectrum has about 25% blue and then

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,959
about um equally just close to 40% uh

39
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,399
green and red in terms of its overall

40
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:38,158
composition there is of course UVB UVA

41
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,799
and far red in that Spectrum as well but

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,799
we have established through

43
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,200
experimentation that that for efficient

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,118
photosynthesis really plants only really

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,200
absorb the par range which is

46
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,280
efficiently which is from 400 to to 700

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,759
nanometers there is a little bit uh of

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,359
photosynthesis happening at at the

49
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,280
Beyond um that range that part range uh

50
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,319
but um it is the most efficient within

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,318
that range in terms of looking at at the

52
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:13,079
effect on plant shape and development

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:15,399
and quality then um as we said before uh

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,319
in previous videos blue is very

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,680
important in terms of regulating plant

56
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:22,560
height particularly for indoor Growers

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,120
so having at least a minimum amount of

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,519
three or 4% blue is essential to have

59
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,599
short and dense growth an absence of

60
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,759
blue will have very tall stretchy plants

61
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,199
um so having a high proportion of blue

62
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,799
is is critical however in terms of

63
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,079
modern lighting technology grow lighting

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,680
technology most Growers these days are

65
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:49,000
using LEDs and LEDs so if you take for

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,879
example even a a relatively uh warm um

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,120
color spectrum so something in the the

68
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:58,439
color temperature range of of say 2,000

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,000
two and a half thousand um we we would

70
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,840
you would still have uh around seven or

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,680
8% blue um even even in that relatively

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,920
warm spectrum and that's plenty for

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,760
short and dense growth and typically

74
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,280
grite manufacturers these days have a

75
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,280
mixed color temperature because they're

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,400
using H cool white and warm white LEDs

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,080
together and often um 660 nanometer or

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,120
deep red LEDs as well all those combined

79
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,519
together usually result in a color

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,158
temperature of about 35,000 K and this

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,519
uh has a percentage blue of about 12 or

82
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:39,399
four 12 to 14% so plenty for short and

83
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:43,560
dense growth again as we just discussed

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,560
before there is um green the proportion

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,519
of green and red really is um is not

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,840
critical in terms of of um the plant

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,239
shape um they are fairly neutral in

88
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,438
terms of of how that plant is going to

89
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,360
develop there is an argument um for that

90
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,719
again we covered this before about using

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,400
far red for example at the early stages

92
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:11,199
of growth far red can um increase the

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,799
leaf size in Plants um but I think those

94
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,478
that that benefit is marginal and

95
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,358
limited um and often with these things

96
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,680
it's a compromise so you do one thing

97
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,719
and it'll affect something else so using

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,199
too much far red you will get tall

99
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,800
stretched stretchy plans so in summary

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,080
in terms of the modern tech that we have

101
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,000
which is white LEDs mixed with 660 nanm

102
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:41,279
red they are really very close to what

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,959
we would want as an Optimum uh to

104
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,638
deliver efficient rate of

105
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:49,319
photosynthesis and develop healthy

106
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,160
plants which are short and dense it's

107
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,918
one of the main characteristics we want

108
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,400
um and um and as we said previously

109
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,560
under white light we can visually

110
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,679
inspect them and see them clearly

111
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,959
so look at these uh spectrums in these

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,519
Spectrum recipes that we have have

113
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,079
access to you know dialing in literally

114
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,120
um how's this compared to like uh

115
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,800
sunlight know you touched on some of the

116
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,720
the percentages you know why don't we

117
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,960
just kind of if we have the option why

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,759
don't we just set all the dials to

119
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,439
basically sunlight and kind of leave it

120
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,280
at that why should we bother nessing and

121
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,240
pushing or you know changing things why

122
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,519
it just we got the option make it

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
sunlight that's what plants are used to

124
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,680
and just kind of leave it at that what

125
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,918
the advantage of going through and

126
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,918
optimizing our Spectrum yeah so so we

127
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,758
absolutely could we could have so for

128
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,519
example white LEDs and we could add far

129
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,800
red LEDs and we could add UVA LEDs and

130
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:46,359
even UVB

131
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,439
LEDs um to um to mimic the sun Spectrum

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,680
as as close as we possibly could however

133
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:56,199
it would cost a lot more to do so so um

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,800
from a couple of points first of all the

135
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,600
UVA LEDs and UVB LEDs uh are more

136
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,439
expensive than the white ones in terms

137
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,919
of the amount of photons you get per

138
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,639
watt and the dollars per watt that

139
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,439
you're spending on those LEDs in the

140
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,439
first

141
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,240
instance um and secondarily they're not

142
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,279
as photosynthetically efficient so they

143
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,918
don't

144
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,399
contribute um as efficiently to

145
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:24,519
photosynthesis as um as our wh a range

146
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,959
of our par range so on two fronts you're

147
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,519
spending more up front on the fixture

148
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,758
cost and then secondarily you're going

149
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:37,439
going to cost more in electricity terms

150
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,800
um to provide these um these wavelengths

151
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,160
which are not necessarily beneficial to

152
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,160
the uh the mass of plant who are

153
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,680
producing so the rate of growth and the

154
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,720
the yield that we're going to ultimately

155
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,959
get or the quality of the um the produce

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,160
that we're going to come out with in the

157
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:57,279
end so not shown you know changing your

158
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,759
color temperature for example changing

159
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:04,239
the proportion of blue is is is not

160
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,759
shown to change the um the percentage of

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,720
cannaboids or the potency of cannabis um

162
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,360
and it's not really shown to have much

163
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,120
of a any other qualitative effect so

164
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,639
really if you want to grow as much as

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,199
possible um stay within the efficient

166
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,639
par spectrum and luckily that coincides

167
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,400
with theyd the cheaper photons to

168
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,840
produce uh and the cheaper fixture cost

169
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,839
to purchase in the first

170
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,079
they're kind of along the lines of just

171
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,079
because we can doesn't mean we should

172
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,318
type thing really taking that maximum

173
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,478
efficiency there um so kind of taking

174
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,960
the sunlight using that as a gauge but

175
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,038
then narrowing it down to really what

176
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,598
the plants are utilizing from all that

177
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,759
light that they're essentially exposed

178
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,240
to they just touched on this before

179
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,960
we've got previous videos on the par

180
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,120
things like that so just going over just

181
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,878
a little bit more when we're looking at

182
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,199
this efficient Spectrum uh comes back

183
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,400
again I think to to par again so if you

184
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,000
just kind of reiterate just for everyone

185
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,359
what that par is and kind of where that

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,120
efficiency lies in our lighting that is

187
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,680
going to produce the most of our plants

188
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,360
as efficiently as possible yeah so um as

189
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,439
a scientist called McCree developed the

190
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,960
McCree curve um which is still used

191
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:29,598
today and it is h a it was experiments

192
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,199
were done to look at the effect of

193
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,319
different wavelength of light on the

194
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,360
rate of photosynthesis in Plants um and

195
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,399
this was done for for a wide range of

196
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,200
plants under different conditions and it

197
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:45,519
was shown that again the the most

198
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,800
photosynthesis happens with the in the

199
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,480
power range between 400 and 700 there is

200
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:55,319
a trail off or a tail off on on each end

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,440
so UVA does cause cause it somewhat

202
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,839
although it reduces as you go into

203
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,880
shorter wave length and far red causes

204
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,000
photosynthesis as well um that within

205
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,919
the par

206
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,440
range um red is considered to be the

207
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:12,799
most photos photosynthetically efficient

208
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,839
um blue is the next most

209
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,919
photosynthetically efficient and green

210
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,760
the last but there is not a huge

211
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:23,240
difference between them and as we've

212
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,240
said before it is um you do need a

213
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,399
proportion of blue in that Spectrum so

214
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,759
we need a certain amount of it to get

215
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,679
the right plant shape and with green it

216
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,519
may not be as photosynthetically

217
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,199
efficient in in in narrow terms but in

218
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,720
terms the whole plant photosynthesis

219
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,278
green penetrates deeper into the leaves

220
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,399
so it gets to uh cells which other um

221
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:50,240
which which blue or red photons wouldn't

222
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,200
reach and green green photons also

223
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
Bounce Around the canopies so get to

224
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,959
parts of the plant that um green and red

225
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,399
photons wouldn't reach so having that

226
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:05,399
mix of blue green green and red leads to

227
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,039
a a more efficient uh system overall in

228
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,759
terms of the lighting

229
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,639
efficiency and also the the overall rate

230
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,120
of photosynthesis of the plant yeah

231
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,759
thanks for providing that uh that

232
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,679
breakdown of those important you know

233
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,159
wavelengths so hopefully no one's you

234
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:24,199
know setting your dials to sunlight or

235
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,799
setting a color wavelength to zero

236
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,839
probably not the most efficient

237
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,039
utilizing that and kind of work on that

238
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
recipe as we would for new s working on

239
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,439
that recipe for Optimum lighting

240
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,120
Spectrum also plays into the efficiency

241
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,160
of plant production do all come back to

242
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,799
par um does all come back to kind of

243
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,240
this greater understanding hopefully the

244
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,479
new scientific research that will

245
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,440
continue to come out uh I want to thank
