1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
he was going to be a brief overview of

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:08,580
three main classifications of injuries

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,190
that may occur on the body so first one

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,349
is sprains so the ligaments reinforcing

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,509
the joint are stretched or torn in this

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,850
case partially torn ligaments slowly

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,760
repair themselves completely torn

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,368
ligaments require prompt surgical repair

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,720
so if you're someone has a sprain you

10
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,149
may be able to ask them if they have a

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,368
grade one a grade two or a grade three

12
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,948
spring in this case a higher grade is

13
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,200
not a better thing higher grade number

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,510
indicates a more seriousness to the

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,850
injury grade one are just stretching or

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,218
small tears that may occur grade two is

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,809
larger but an incomplete tear grade

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,710
three is a complete tear so that's the

19
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:48,959
worst or most severe case continuing on

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,939
with injuries we also have injuries to

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,308
the cartilage the snap and pop of

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,589
overstressed cartilage common in

23
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:58,709
aerobics injuries repair with

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,590
laparoscopic surgery what laparoscopic

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,539
surgery is here is we're basically said

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,990
of the doctors taking their actual

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,129
instruments in going into the patient

28
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:10,500
laparoscopically are small holes are

29
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:13,199
punctured in and it's basically kind of

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,530
through the doctors control basically

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,020
through robotic arms in they want to TV

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,009
screen it allows for fine detailed

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:26,039
movement and allows for the delicate

34
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,859
repair of certain muscles or ligaments

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,900
that may occur as a result of aerobics

36
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,239
or potentially sport injuries here

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,728
damage to the cartilage in general we

38
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,759
see that here where we have maybe an

39
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:41,129
impact or the foot got stuck in the turf

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,719
here yeah that rotation up here we have

41
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:48,000
that tearing here of a ligament lastly

42
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,349
if our injuries are dislocations so

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
occurs when bones are forced out of

44
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:51,328
alignment

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,530
they're usually accompanied by sprains

46
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:58,618
inflammation and joint immobilization

47
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:01,530
serious Falls can are common sports

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,390
injuries can cause in dislocations so in

49
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,349
relation to this you may hear people say

50
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,718
again kind of like they're

51
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,840
double-jointed and that kind of really

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,400
doesn't exist there's no such thing as a

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,439
joint that can move kind of in two

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,530
different directions with classic

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,050
is a different type of joint but it has

56
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,780
to do with people some people can are

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,610
able to dislocate certain joints of

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,990
their body so if you want to learn more

59
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,600
about this potential kind of

60
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,870
double-jointed or what we may call

61
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,639
double-jointed in dislocation here of

62
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,890
double-jointed medical course and how

63
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,719
these these people with extremely

64
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,829
flexible and ability to dislocate their

65
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,419
shoulders be very painful in some cases

66
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,690
you can learn more about those in these

67
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,609
two videos located here so this again a

68
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,120
brief overview of three different types

69
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,120
of injuries
