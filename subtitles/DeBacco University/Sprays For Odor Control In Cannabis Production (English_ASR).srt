00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
tobacco university video if you're

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,318
looking at using sprays to control

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,120
odors with cannabis plants this will

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:08,719
help you

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:17,920
ensure you're using it in the most

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:17,920
effective way possible

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,559
all right let's get into sprays for odor

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,560
control in cannabis production

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,000
so first off keep in mind that no matter

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,559
what spray or what product they're

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,039
really not

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,198
good stand alone absorbing gels and

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,840
sprays will only do so much to reduce

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,280
odors because these items mask the odor

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
more than eliminate it so that's an

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
important

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
point to keep in mind installing an

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
adequate ventilation system with a

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,480
carbon filter

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
is usually the preferred option sprays

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,479
and gels should only be used in addition

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
to other methods of odor control

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,839
and should really not be relied upon as

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
the sole source

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
of odor control especially as plants get

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
later in their growth stages

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
particularly the flowering stage

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,439
now you also want to keep the plants a

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
safe distance away from any sprays that

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,039
you might be applying because when using

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,359
odor absorbing gels or sprays

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,079
make sure plants are a safe distance

33
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,920
away

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,840
to not only reduce the chance of

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,519
physical damage but to reduce the risk

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
of unwanted scent absorption

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,798
that can negatively impact the taste or

38
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,879
smell of the buds

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,360
that you're looking at producing on your

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,679
cannabis plant

41
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,040
also where are you going to place these

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
sprays or gels is

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
important we want to look when using

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,798
absorbing gels they should be placed in

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,159
your ventilation ducting

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
so if you don't have a ventilation

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
system in place the use of sprays is a

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,719
quick kind of way to help control odors

49
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,239
is

50
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,640
definitely not going to be nearly as

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,399
effective this is where the odors are

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,079
concentrated within the ducting

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
and the risk of the plants is minimized

54
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,199
so it's really helping maximize the

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
effectiveness

56
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,640
of these particular odor absorbing gels

57
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,319
and also sprays

58
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
because you know that odor is going to

59
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,519
be carried through that ducting

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,840
by concentrating the gels and sprays in

61
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,000
that

62
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,680
area that'll help ensure the greatest

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,959
amount of contact with the odors you're

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
trying to reduce

65
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,718
while minimizing any potential risk to

66
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,559
your plants

67
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,478
which will help again get you the effect

68
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,920
that you want by minimizing any sort of

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
damage that might occur
