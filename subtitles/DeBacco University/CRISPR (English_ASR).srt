1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
here I'm going to go over a gene editing

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,549
technique giving a lot of popularity in

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:11,370
the scientific community called CRISPR

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:13,169
so CRISPR the basics of it is that it's

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,209
a gene editing method that exists in

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,189
living organisms the organs that it

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,140
exists in are it's a simplified

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,089
antiviral defense system found in

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,210
bacteria scientists have been able to

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:26,579
identify this and are now using this for

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,189
gene editing of many different cells

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,719
other than just bacteria CRISPR allows

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,000
for cells genome to be cut at

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,159
predetermined locations it's very

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,289
specific which is probably why it's

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,589
getting popularity and that result in

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:43,140
the removal or the addition of specific

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,700
genes so it's specific and it allows for

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,609
modification of their genes by either

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,289
addition or removal

21
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:51,808
now CRISPR stands for clustered

22
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,149
regularly interspaced short palindromic

23
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,799
repeats so try to highlight the words

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,009
here clustered is this kind of a

25
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,538
grouping regulates a defined pattern

26
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:03,329
interspace is just a distance between

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,618
objects it's small and short distances

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,650
so it's looking for a very short

29
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,688
sequence palindromic that's a sequence

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,359
that reads the same backwards as it does

31
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:13,618
for words such as mom or dad or

32
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,540
something a little more complex like

33
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,009
race car who spell the letters out

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,950
forwards and backwards you'll get this

35
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,478
same word remember though DNA will

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,689
always read in the 5 to 3 prime

37
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,090
direction and the last letter R stands

38
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:29,789
for repeats this occurs again in this

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,710
same form kind of like the post here so

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,770
a lot of times I hear CRISPR referred to

41
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:37,169
as CRISPR cast 9 the reason why that is

42
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:40,739
is that cast 9 is an enzyme that can cut

43
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,379
DNA so CRISPR cast 9 the complex allows

44
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,810
to the removal or addition of specific

45
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,728
genes which is great the possibility of

46
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,879
the Acosta 9 nucleus remember those

47
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:53,459
three letters ace can imply an enzyme in

48
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,489
this case it does this is a complex it's

49
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,228
created with guide RNA so the cassadine

50
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,658
in this image is kind of like the blue

51
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,399
areas that you see in the guide RNA is

52
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,329
kind of the green areas here and you'll

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,118
see that through some of the other

54
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:08,909
images in this presentation so this

55
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,679
guide RNA this G RNA guide RNAs

56
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,439
sequences that will bind to the DNA

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,039
sequence to be edited it's often

58
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,120
abbreviated

59
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:21,419
guide RNA as G little G RNA or single

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,969
guide RNAs G RNA this guide RNA is

61
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,669
non-coding too short RNA sequence that

62
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:28,560
will bind the complementary DNA sequence

63
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:32,189
we see the double helix double strand of

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,709
DNA here and here it's binding 5 to 3

65
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:36,870
prime this sequence which is the reason

66
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,509
CRISPR can be so specific looking for

67
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,730
these specific nucleotides that guide

68
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:46,979
RNA RNA is encased and wrapped here in

69
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:50,039
the caste 9 enzyme now the basic process

70
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:53,219
of CRISPR is first scientists have to

71
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,658
identify target DNA sequences so in the

72
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,158
genome that could be a gene that needs

73
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:58,798
modification it could be a disease

74
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:01,138
whatever gene is being identified first

75
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,060
by scientists then it has to be

76
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,549
identified so that guide RNA can be

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,530
created so that the complement of the

78
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:09,450
DNA sequence is very specific it's a

79
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,068
very short region so we identify the

80
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,429
gene and then it makes the complement

81
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:16,469
RNA for the guide RNA then the guide RNA

82
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,659
and the cassadine are attached to form

83
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,568
this complex and then this complex will

84
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,948
then be inserted into target cells as it

85
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,108
goes through target cells that will go

86
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,250
through and read other DNA in this case

87
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,310
we're reading that chromosome

88
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,259
and once sequence is found the DNA will

89
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,959
be cleaved I have a picture of a cleaver

90
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:36,780
here or nice kind of cutting it's gonna

91
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,549
cut that DNA whence it cuts that DNA

92
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,909
that can allow for the addition or

93
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:45,169
deletion of nucleotides to occur at that

94
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:47,789
specific region now the advantage of

95
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:49,680
CRISPR is some the possibilities it can

96
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,568
silence genes you can alter

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,939
disease-causing genes into a healthy one

98
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:55,768
there's just kind of an example here if

99
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,650
some diseases have been identified on

100
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,840
different chromosomes so once they're

101
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,879
identified if we get the sequence CRISPR

102
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,469
could possibly be used to alter the

103
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,060
disease-causing gene into a healthy one

104
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,068
not only to the benefit of the

105
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,370
individual but their offspring and

106
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:13,469
lineage can also be used specifically

107
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,329
insert a codon could be a stop codon

108
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,699
offer a particular amino acid into a

109
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,400
sequence it can also change or alter

110
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:24,689
gene expression silenced them or up

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,339
regulating them other than editing genes

112
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,750
CRISPR can also activate the

113
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,299
transcription process

114
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,009
remember transcription is DNA to RNA how

115
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,720
that's done is through the deactivation

116
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,209
the cast night cleaning abilities

117
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,910
meaning that in this case the cast night

118
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:41,430
will not be able to break or cut in any

119
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,220
way so it's just able to go through and

120
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,350
activate the transcription process can

121
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,910
also repress or silenced genes you would

122
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,670
see as a repressor blocking certain

123
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,520
genes from being expressed and the last

124
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,980
one here adding a fluorescent label to

125
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,349
visually identify physical locations of

126
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,759
DNA sequences this could be important

127
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,710
where we're identifying and then it's

128
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,930
going to add a little label this can

129
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,479
allow scientists to know the physical

130
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,730
location of certain genes so that they

131
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,680
can aid in development of a 3d model the

132
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,110
genome in tracking the chromosome

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,689
movement so that's another reason why

134
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,550
this degree of being able to

135
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,439
specifically identify certain regions

136
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,280
here visually marking them can be

137
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,469
advantageous to scientists in addition

138
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,509
we have to remember that when we're

139
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,510
modifying genes there's also the

140
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:32,610
potential for social concerns should

141
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,949
human genomes be altered in somatic

142
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,860
cells or embryos is a controversial

143
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,539
issue no matter how it's done and CRISPR

144
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,460
is just some of the latest technology to

145
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,990
offer this

146
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:44,519
what if undetectable off-target effects

147
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,949
occur they have not been studied

148
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,168
comprehensively what potential negative

149
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,459
impacts could that have well this could

150
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,918
change the human genome through a

151
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,649
generation in after generation even

152
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,000
cause disastrous consequences so the

153
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:59,609
thing about if you modify all the

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,620
genetics of a lineage or generation now

155
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,040
even if you don't do it in the future

156
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,978
those modifications will be passed on so

157
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,560
these cause worries included related to

158
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,209
mental health social behaviors designing

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,240
human capabilities such as intelligence

160
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:17,279
appearance personality vision eye color

161
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,110
a whole bunch of different things so

162
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,879
there's just social and ethical concerns

163
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:25,319
with this technology because it is

164
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:28,079
genetic modification there's also been

165
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,389
some research down in over in the UK

166
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,939
that shown reported some unwanted

167
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,680
results of CRISPR so while CRISPR is

168
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,660
often used to generate small deletions

169
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,478
as shown in that so it shows here

170
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,189
scientists have seen unintended large

171
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,579
deletions when I say larger docking

172
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,879
several

173
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,709
thousand nucleotides long in addition to

174
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,870
complicated DNA arrangements of distant

175
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,419
sequences being stitched together these

176
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,850
are all things not intended but can

177
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,280
occur so it must be mindful especially

178
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,810
we're looking at human gene editing this

179
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,509
phenomenon was prevalent and all the

180
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,089
three types of cells tested including a

181
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,120
kind of human gross cell in the

182
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:08,189
laboratory so again something just

183
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,620
weren't in caution and this is a

184
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,480
relatively new technology it needs to

185
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,720
community be studied so we don't have

186
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,819
any of these unwanted edits now with

187
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,500
CRISPR one that's been used in a

188
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,689
positive note is what's called precision

189
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,699
guided sterile inset the technique

190
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,199
kind of a long term there researchers

191
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,490
have developed a new way to control and

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,379
suppress populations of insects

193
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,180
potentially including those that ravage

194
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,899
our cultural crops and transmit deadly

195
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,810
diseases

196
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:36,689
insects can mass produce different are

197
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,269
selected species so by controlling their

198
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,620
populations that can be advantageous and

199
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,599
instead of spraying a pesticide that you

200
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,389
kill all insects this could be very

201
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,960
targeted the precision guides sterile

202
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,909
inset technique the P gsit alters key

203
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,699
genes that control insect sex

204
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,350
determination and fertility so how could

205
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,209
this possibly be used to control and st.

206
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,590
populations well when we take these

207
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,629
precision guided sterile insect

208
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,669
technique what will happen is we'll take

209
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,009
eggs and I'll introduce to target

210
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,470
populations where only adult sterile

211
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,000
males will emerge this results in a

212
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,380
novel environmentally-friendly and

213
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,759
relatively low-cost method of

214
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,639
controlling pest populations in the

215
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,800
future this is also very specific and

216
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,870
the screwworm fly was the first pest

217
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,730
successfully eliminated from an era

218
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,680
through sterile insect technique by the

219
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,080
use of this integrated area-wide

220
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,459
approach so it's not looking at spraying

221
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,560
some sort of chemical at me into the

222
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,509
environment this is using CRISPR to

223
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,450
specifically target this particular

224
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,889
species of fly create sterile males and

225
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,870
really reduce it and hopefully

226
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:41,669
potentially eliminate them from the

227
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:43,379
population lastly because this is such a

228
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,019
new technology so is looking at some

229
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,549
sources here and also some additional

230
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,079
YouTube views that you're welcome to
