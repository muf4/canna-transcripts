00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,278
going to go over selective plant harvest

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
process of cannabis

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,800
and we're going to get to see an actual

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,080
example in the greenhouse setting

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,719
where the apical bud was taken to allow

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,320
time for those side buds to kind of

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,278
develop so you get to see an actual

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,050
example

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,568
of this process in action

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,569
[Music]

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,439
[Music]

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,359
all right let's get into selective plant

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,359
harvest process regarding cannabis

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,920
and remember at the end you'll see that

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,759
actual example in the greenhouse setting

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,679
so first off when we're looking at

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,640
selective harvest plants do not mature

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,039
in unison

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,039
so most plants will have variability in

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,839
degree of maturity of their buds

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
so ensuring each that the peak harvest

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
simply puts

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,120
required for a staggered harvest because

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,519
they're not all ripening at the same

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,119
time

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
so taking those apical buds and letting

28
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,599
these develop can be a great way

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
to kind of make sure all the buds are

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,960
being harvested

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,040
at their peak maturity not just saying

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
oh one's ready to go let me take the

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
entire plant because there's going to be

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,118
that

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,039
variability so you're kind of reducing

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,840
the amount of variability you have

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,840
in each bud in the end at least so

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,159
harvesting only the tops first this is

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
one of the methods that we will see

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,200
example at the end

41
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,719
if you can only harvest the top bloods

42
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,159
first and wait for the others this can

43
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,478
dramatically improve

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,600
your overall end product this is due the

45
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,400
fact that the top bud

46
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,719
or buds simply get more light intensity

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,159
than

48
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,840
lower buds which speeds up the

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
maturation process

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
these apical buds will have greater size

51
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,239
and density which are two main qualities

52
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,478
that are highly sought after and when

53
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,000
you remove or cut down that top bud

54
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,519
well now these side buds that might have

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
got a little bit of shading from that

56
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,399
larger top bud

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
well now they're going to get more light

58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,239
now they're going to be able to mature

59
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,880
now they're able to get to a larger size

60
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,640
than they would

61
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,798
if you left that top butt on there and

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
just waited longer by removing that top

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,040
bud

64
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
those secondary buds have a greater

65
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,920
chance at developing and becoming

66
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,599
higher quality so again once the top is

67
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
gone and here's an example

68
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,000
of a picture and we'll see this uh plant

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,239
or similar one to this

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,520
in a moment here but that top is gone

71
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,719
take that top blood off

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
after we take that apical blood is

73
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,199
removed this allows the lower buds we

74
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,238
can see

75
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,958
here and also here to be exposed to more

76
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,480
light

77
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,719
this increase in light exposure will

78
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,318
help increase their development

79
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,919
overall this will allow these lower buds

80
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,519
to increase in size and density

81
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,000
that would not have been possible the

82
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
top apical bud was left

83
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,199
i do know there's a little bit of

84
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,360
powdery mildew going on here that

85
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,518
increased light exposure

86
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,560
can also help with that as well but here

87
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
we can see clearly

88
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,598
that topical blood was removed and these

89
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,719
side buds now we're going to have a

90
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,598
better chance

91
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,878
at producing a higher quality end

92
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,359
product

93
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,039
so concentrates or a dry flour well if

94
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,959
you're going to make concentrate

95
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,239
there's simply less incentive to perform

96
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,280
selective harvest

97
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,878
concentrates because you're going to be

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
concentrating it anyway you can go

99
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,878
through and just kind of do that whole

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,479
plant harvest

101
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,318
however if you're looking to have top

102
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,518
quality dry flour

103
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,039
and as much of this product as possible

104
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,519
then selective harvest would be

105
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,479
recommended this will add to the final

106
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
dry weight and density of the total buds

107
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,959
now we're going to go through on a

108
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
greenhouse setting and we're going to

109
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
take a look

110
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
at what this kind of selective harvest

111
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,280
removing of that apical bud

112
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,959
actually looks like hope you enjoy so in

113
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
an effort to kind of get the maximum

114
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,319
yield here we can see the grower

115
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,280
selected to take the top or apical

116
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,439
meristem bud

117
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,439
take that top bud off get that cured and

118
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,400
dried and here we have our secondary

119
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,639
buds we're going to give them a little

120
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
bit more time to kind of cure up and dry

121
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,318
and expand there but we're able to get

122
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
the kind of a grade or top grade

123
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
off the plant and that allows these to

124
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,919
kind of finish up ripening

125
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
to maximize the harvest we're going to

126
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,120
get
