1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,398
going to take a look at

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,200
trends and cannabinoid accumulation in

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:16,399
cannabis

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:17,679
over time

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,519
all right let's get into cannabinoid

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,439
accumulation in cannabis

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,118
and here we're seeing a graph and that's

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
we're going to be looking at as part of

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,480
this presentation

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,239
so first off as always try to provide

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,160
you with the research article or some of

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,640
the data was collected from

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,238
fairly recent here but again welcome to

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
check this out for yourself

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,599
to get some more of the study specifics

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,679
so

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,640
what did they use when we're determining

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,719
these kinetic

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,878
cannabinoid contents well a lot of times

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,840
we're looking at totals total cbd

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
thc cbg well how are those kind of

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
calculated

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
well it's important to know the formula

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,679
that's used in the calculation for the

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,719
total cannabinoid percentage

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,719
and here we can see cbg for example

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,399
would be the cbga percentage

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,159
times 0.878 and that would be added to

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
the percent cbg to get the

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,400
total cbg and we could see the other

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,000
conversion factors here

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
for some of the other cannabinoids and

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,239
this study was looking at growth rate

35
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,519
dry matter percentage and other things

36
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,839
so there are some more

37
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,959
formulas provided there but this gives

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,759
you an idea when you're seeing the word

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,478
total

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,640
versus just cbc for example how they're

41
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,400
calculating those numbers

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
now total potential cannabinoids so when

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
we're looking at some trends here

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
what's great is that they actually

45
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,599
sectioned out some different cultivars

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
so this is the time series measurements

47
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,879
of cannabinoid accumulation for

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,159
chemotypes three plants

49
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,438
in 30 hemp cultivars total potential

50
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,079
cbd thc and cpc accumulation as a

51
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,279
percent

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:51,199
of dry matter based on weekly shoot tip

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,000
sampling qualified by hplc now the cbed

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
is located right here we can see here is

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
the thc

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
and this is the graph for cbc these

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
curved models using

58
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,000
third degree polynomial generalization

59
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,239
linear models

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,118
and then we see the cultivars here color

61
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,519
coded

62
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,719
provided right here we're seeing overall

63
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,239
general trends of an

64
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:15,280
increase in cannabinoids as we look at

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,560
later weeks into flower some stayed flat

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
some actually decreased and

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,280
increased for a little bit some are kind

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,719
of more linear somewhat more exponential

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,719
so it's just important to take that into

70
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,239
consideration we can see that there's

71
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,800
two standouts here for the

72
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,039
cbc so again if we're looking at

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,360
isolating the particular compounds

74
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,280
cultivar selection might be important

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,640
and looking at the general trends here

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
now when we're looking at the thc what

77
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,839
does this dotted line represent

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
well this dotted line is representing

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
the 0.3 percent which is considered to

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,639
be the federal limit

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
so we can see here some stayed

82
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,719
definitely well below that federal limit

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
and many of them did increase right

84
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,598
above that once you're kind of getting

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
into that you know

86
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,280
week we'll say one and a half to two

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
into flowering

88
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,560
many of these cultivars did exceed that

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959
limit so just important to

90
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
take that into consideration now we're

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,439
looking at the canal

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
analysis so this is kind of a kind of

93
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,878
slide here you might want to look at the

94
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,919
research or just might want to pause the

95
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,359
slide and take a look at it because

96
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,559
there's some great information

97
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
but there's a lot of information

98
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,519
presented here so this is the

99
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,840
cannabinoid analysis

100
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,039
of the strict biomass samples looking at

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,239
the cbd thc

102
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,959
ratio included a 1.013 times

103
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,519
cbn percentage as portion of the total

104
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
thc so just take that into consideration

105
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,280
percentages and ratios are estimated of

106
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,318
mixed linear models with cultivar as a

107
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
fixed effect

108
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,518
and the interaction between site and

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
block as a random effect

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
so that's just getting into the details

111
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,599
of the actual study which if you want to

112
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,679
learn more about

113
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,199
find that article and go look at some of

114
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
the materials and methods and the

115
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,000
details that they provided

116
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,079
now if you're just looking at like total

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,199
cannabinoids or total cbd

118
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,480
thc produced by the different cultivars

119
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,119
this is kind of that great little

120
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,518
summary

121
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
on table here we can kind of go through

122
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
and do a little comparison

123
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,959
they are organized by the total

124
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
cannabinoids produced here

125
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,640
which is kind of a summary of all of the

126
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,840
ones provided here

127
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,958
some very high in cbd

128
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
and some favoring more of the thc that

129
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
will be well above that federal

130
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,478
limit there so again just kind of some

131
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,918
great information there take a look at

132
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,319
it gives you some kind of that cultivar

133
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,358
or id just something that you might be

134
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,199
considering

135
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,120
if you're looking at cultivars to plant

136
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,120
in your area

137
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
now another research article here is

138
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,519
looking at the accumulation of bioactive

139
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,079
metabolites

140
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,719
and we see the link right here provided

141
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,599
and what this

142
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
data showed uh is kind of a nice graph

143
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,479
presented right here

144
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,240
and this is looking at total

145
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,599
cannabinoids compared to total

146
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,040
terpenes so cured trimmed flowers were

147
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
extracted for the

148
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,080
terpenes in cannabinoids a composition

149
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,360
by

150
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,680
and this was determined by a gcfid

151
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,840
method of analysis the total values for

152
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,959
cannabinoids and terpenes in each sample

153
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,478
were plotted

154
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,079
so what we're looking at here we do see

155
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,839
some variability

156
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,359
but overall we're looking at the total

157
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,560
cannabinoids and dry weight

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
and we're looking until the terpenes

159
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
produce and there's a general trend the

160
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,919
higher amount of total cannabinoids

161
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,079
produced

162
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,599
tended to lead to a greater amount of

163
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,519
terpenes produced as well

164
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,560
now there's multiple potential reasons

165
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,918
for this this could be if you're

166
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,360
maximizing up the cannabinoids you have

167
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,240
good growing practices

168
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,360
and that might improve overall chemicals

169
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
produced within

170
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,479
the plant there it's not you know as you

171
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,919
can see there's a little bit of a

172
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,319
scatter here but that dotted line does

173
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,359
definitely show a trend or correlation

174
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,199
some were really high in comparison

175
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
so again just the general trends of

176
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,520
everyone trying to produce more

177
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,879
cannabinoids

178
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,799
might be some benefits from the

179
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,120
cannabinoid standpoint but also

180
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,319
increasing the amount of terpenes that

181
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,038
are also produced

182
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,240
can be advantageous for growers looking

183
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,759
at marketing

184
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
their product
