1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,830
this video lectures will get plants

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,470
adaptations to terrestrial living

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,449
how did plants make the change from

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,968
living in a mainly aquatic environment

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:13,798
such as the ocean here to living on land

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,890
which has a lot of challenges associated

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,600
with it well adapt ins is distressed

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,580
real living in general plants are

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,269
complex multicellular organisms that are

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:26,669
autotrophs proposed synthetic overall

11
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,528
now their primary terrestrial down that

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,359
organisms on the surface of Earth in

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,520
nearly three hundred thousand species of

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,380
plants are none today and this just

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,420
gives you an example of some of the

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,969
diversity within odd plants so adapting

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,530
to this terrestrial event green algae

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,780
that were probably the ancestors of

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,549
today's plans are aquatic organisms that

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,890
are not well adapted to living on land

21
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,269
before their descendants live on land

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,850
that they had to overcome many

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,250
environmental challenges so just making

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,170
this jump even to the rocks here you see

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,109
green algae pictured right here

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,329
questions are how did they and these

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,549
plants learn to absorb minerals how do

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,349
they conserve water being on land and

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,299
how they reproduce on land these are

30
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,759
some of the major challenges plans out

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,860
the face so again comparing that algae

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,719
to that plant the whole algae performs

33
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,150
photosynthesis surrounding water

34
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,670
supports it and it can hold fast in this

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,590
case in the water well terrestrial based

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,049
plants have beliefs buccal stamatis

37
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,380
stems and roots help support them and

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,340
we're going to go over these in detail

39
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:32,429
so to start adapting to the rest

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,990
environment plant macro nutrients those

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,180
are the big nutrients that plants are

42
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,429
mostly composed of they constitute only

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,079
one percent or more of plants biomass

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,280
which is their dry weight these are

45
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,750
things might be familiar was seeing on

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,469
fertilizer such as nitrogen potassium

47
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,390
calcium phosphorus magnesium and sulfur

48
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:50,459
and these may not be an exact elemental

49
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,200
form but they're what plants needs so

50
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,269
that you don't get this yellowing region

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,380
here this is the potassium deficiency

52
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:57,688
I'm going to make sure your soils

53
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,959
fertile and has the proper amount of

54
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:02,459
nutrients to support the plant growth

55
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,259
now peach influences nutrient

56
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,478
availability so we see here a pH of

57
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,060
seven which is neutral most of the

58
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,120
nutrients overall in land are most

59
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,800
widely available as we decrease or

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,659
become more acidic receive

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,570
two nitrogen potassium phosphorus

62
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,969
sulphur calcium all start to really get

63
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,030
less plant-available same thing if the

64
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:26,039
soil becomes too alkaline it can also

65
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,169
reduce the availability of certain

66
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,269
nutrients you see iron here being the

67
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,599
exception at a lower pH it's more plant

68
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,300
available so what is pH just reminders

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,479
and measure of the hydrogen ions and see

70
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,660
here pH of 0 being extremely acidic pH

71
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:46,649
of 7 being neutral and pH 14 being very

72
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,719
basic we see where some common solutions

73
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,170
you might be familiar with great so

74
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,840
coffee slightly acidic blood is just

75
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,389
ever so slightly basic milk of magnesia

76
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,310
ammonia bleach a lot more on the base a

77
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,319
lot of your household cleaners are basic

78
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,810
in this again here also gives you just

79
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,479
that Journal scale of what it is in pH

80
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,180
remember mathematically is equal to the

81
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,090
minus the log base 10 of the hydrogen

82
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,610
ion concentration so way to think about

83
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,400
this is a very acidic environment has a

84
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,739
lot of hydrogen ions as we work our way

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,129
to becoming more basic we notice the

86
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,039
hydrogen ion amount decreases and the

87
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,259
hydroxide ion increases this is it's a

88
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,319
proportion because it forms this nice

89
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,599
rectangle at page 7 or neutral the

90
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,229
hydrogen ion concentration would equal

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,639
the hydroxide ion concentration and a

92
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,899
pure water which is what neutral would

93
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:47,609
be is h2o so you see one hydrogen ion

94
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:51,330
and one hydroxide becomes h2o h o H is

95
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:54,630
reduced to h2o and just these little

96
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,130
brackets meet concentration so different

97
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:57,840
crops are different target ranges and

98
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,900
what to think there's one golden pH to

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,700
reach grasses are 6.2 to 7 blueberries

100
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,010
are much more acidic four point five to

101
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,919
five Tomatoes like you grow in your

102
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:10,979
garden 6.0 to 7 so there's different pH

103
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,039
ranges for different crops what all

104
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,810
crops have here is roots and these roots

105
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,000
are responsible for absorbing minerals

106
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,769
along with water the first plants

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,500
involved the symbiotic association with

108
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,439
fungi called mycorrhizae this is a

109
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,750
beneficial fungi that helps absorb

110
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:30,209
nutrients so the plant is able to morph

111
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,610
absorb nutrients while the plant gives

112
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,199
the mycorrhizae the fungi sugars that it

113
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,420
makes from the leaves this is what it's

114
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,750
a symbiotic relationship both species

115
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,300
are benefiting so adapting terrestrial

116
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,509
living one key living on land is of wing

117
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,250
preventing key being dry drying out put

118
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,050
inside of watertight waxy that are

119
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,699
coming kind of cuticle this is what it

120
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,240
looks like here it allows water to beat

121
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,529
up highly waxy lipid based water enters

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,689
the plants only through the roots

123
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,669
Nikhil's will prevents water loss to the

124
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:02,160
air so water's coming in the roots

125
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,560
through the stems here and end up to the

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,939
leaves going through this is an example

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,918
the leaf what we're gonna learn more

128
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,589
about in another video but this cuticle

129
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,418
is is protective layer limiting the

130
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:16,229
amount of exposure water can evaporate

131
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:18,509
out one area that water can leave is

132
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,009
called the stomata specialized pores

133
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,319
that allow passage of water through the

134
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,000
cuticle remember these are pores si

135
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,310
holes in the leaves because the plant

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
can regulate them as we see here they're

137
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,610
found in leaves and sometimes between

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
portions of the stem they allow for the

139
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,370
passage of carbon dioxide into the plant

140
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,560
or in the photosynthetic process and

141
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,360
water vapor and oxygen can pass out of

142
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,819
them and again the plant can regulate

143
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,780
whether that's open or closed when it's

144
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,889
open water can leave but allows

145
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:50,219
necessary components that carbon dioxide

146
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,599
into the leaf however there's only so

147
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,380
much the plant and keep these open

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,879
before it dries out and could die so

149
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,759
Monza give and take process you know

150
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,990
letting water out and co2 in however the

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,300
plant can only let so much water out

152
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,069
before Wilson may die and we see here's

153
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,870
the example of the stomata in a

154
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,459
cross-section microscopic view of the

155
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,060
leaf you see that very thick cuticle

156
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:14,870
here on top and also in the bottom only

157
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,220
allowing water loss through the stomata

158
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,389
one of the other challenges that plants

159
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,850
face go into the terrestrial environment

160
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,289
is reproduction as plants could not move

161
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,729
it was necessary for plans to pass

162
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,729
gametes from one individual to another

163
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:28,019
early plants needed a film of water for

164
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:30,659
sperm to swim to the egg and fertilize

165
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:33,029
it later pollen was developed along the

166
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,160
transferor Gammage without drying out so

167
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:37,799
very early plants as we see in losses

168
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,890
very low to the ground in that civil

169
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,670
water now plants have developed ways to

170
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,439
use potentially

171
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,300
err they can use also use pollinators to

172
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,509
help that so these are some of the ways

173
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,370
plants developed and dealt with some of

174
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,349
the challenges going from the aquatic

175
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,480
environment or the algae or common

176
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,260
ancestor may originated to the dry

177
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,259
environment of land
