1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,719
okay this video electrician will get

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,139
smooth muscle and a little bit more

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,320
detail so smooth muscle this is how it

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,058
would look under a microscope now what

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,630
we're looking at here there's an insane

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:14,820
image

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,899
cells are long and spindle shaped they

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,820
each contain a single nucleus and Celer

9
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,339
microfilaments are loosely organized we

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,689
often call these sheets of cells so look

11
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,789
at this image it might be a little hard

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,710
to be able to tell that look at the kind

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,439
of representation image here we see

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,439
these distinctive features coming into

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,630
play now a relaxed smooth muscle cells

16
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,729
can all look like this say they're kind

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,030
of long spindle shape this is kind of

18
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:44,128
what we mean when they're contracted

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,299
they take on this kind of bunched up cut

20
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,780
parents they kind of take this kind of

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:53,280
clumsy look here versus their normal

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,140
relaxed spindle shaped so they're where

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,609
our squares smooth muscle found well

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,969
it's found in the walls of blood vessels

25
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,409
the stomach and the intestines and this

26
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,390
is if you were taking a cross-section

27
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,390
this is what it would look like now the

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,790
nucleus is one per cell and its central

29
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,310
looking centrally located in each cell

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,409
the smooth muscle cell is elongated

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,060
spindle shape and much smaller than a

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,609
skeletal muscle cell if you were to

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,079
compare the two directly that relaxed

34
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,728
shape that spindle shaped and then

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,340
here's that contracted that can bunched

36
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,959
look the advantage of smooth muscles

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,930
that provides powerful rhythmic

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,209
involuntary contractions this is helpful

39
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,460
to move food through the stomach through

40
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,828
the intestines to help blood go through

41
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,379
the vessels all these things are very

42
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,719
important and is involuntary means we

43
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,000
don't have to think about it they're

44
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,868
known for their slow sustained

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,868
contractions

46
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:47,188
there are Thomas meaning they're not

47
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:49,590
voluntary control they just happen they

48
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,379
do contain actin and myosin filaments

49
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,210
but lack the sarcomeres and predominant

50
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,429
locations are wall the GI tract

51
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,379
that's the gastro potential intestinal

52
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,229
tract walls of the arteries and veins

53
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:04,078
and around glands is typically where

54
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:05,670
you'll find these smooth muscles so even

55
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,340
though we don't have direct control over

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:13,400
them they do provide us with some very

57
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,400
necessary everyday functions of body
