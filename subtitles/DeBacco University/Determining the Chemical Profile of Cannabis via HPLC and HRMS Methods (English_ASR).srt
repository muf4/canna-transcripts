1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
all right in this tobacco university

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,120
video we'll be investigating

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,120
two scientific articles that will help

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,160
us address the topic of determining the

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,280
chemical profile of cannabis via hplc

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,919
and hrms methods we'll learn about what

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,160
each of those

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,039
is more detail here in this video

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,719
lecture

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
so starting with the first reference

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,919
article here again with any reference

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
article i try to give you that first

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,039
page

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,399
the proper citation and a direct link

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,039
there so you can go investigate it

16
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,320
further

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
if you want to look at some more of the

18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
details so looking at canvas

19
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,439
variability and that's kind of where

20
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
these methods are looking at kind of

21
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,879
trying to assess that

22
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,799
the variability within cannabis in

23
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,559
general so cannabis strains

24
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,119
significantly vary in their chemical

25
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,878
compositions the concentration of

26
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,359
cannabis compounds depend on the plant's

27
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,199
tissue type the age the variety the

28
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,159
growing conditions such as

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,399
nutrition or fed the humidity and light

30
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,799
levels harvest time storage conditions

31
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,000
as well as many other things analyzing

32
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,640
the chemical content

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
the plants is of major importance

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,359
considering that the concentrations of

35
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,518
these constituents

36
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
and their interplay may determine

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,478
medical effects

38
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,960
and also potentially adverse side

39
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,920
effects so getting a good idea

40
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,239
of what the actual compounds are present

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
is

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,879
uh well worthwhile so what methods we go

43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,118
through to evaluate those

44
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,920
so we have two presented here we have

45
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,040
the

46
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,359
gas chromatography or abbreviated gc

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,439
and they have hplc which stands for high

48
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,478
performance liquid chromatography

49
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,319
so hplc resolves the threat of the

50
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,679
phytocannabinoid decomposition as a

51
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,399
result of the heating

52
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
compared with gas chromatography we also

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
see kind of a great little quick

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,079
comparison here

55
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,679
hplc can be directly applied for

56
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,199
fractions of extracts

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,360
into separate pure compounds unlike the

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
grass chromatography fractions of

59
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,000
extracts are of high importance in

60
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,040
medical research

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,519
and for structure classification so this

62
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,079
is why

63
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,000
typically when we're comparing the two

64
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,239
overall the hplc

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,239
is typically favored over the more

66
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,399
traditional gas chromatography

67
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,598
particularly or especially in related to

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
cannabis

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,719
continuing on to another research

70
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
article if you want to look at some more

71
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,120
information

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,080
again same uh reference link and copy of

73
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
the first page here

74
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,719
if you want to look at this one in more

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,879
detail in this way we're looking at the

76
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,759
kind of the the comparison of extracted

77
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,840
ion uh

78
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,598
chromatograms here and we what we see is

79
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,039
these kind of like chemical signatures

80
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,959
we're liquid chromatography methods

81
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,120
coupled to high resolution

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,400
mass spec detection and this is where we

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,080
get the hplc

84
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,239
hrms that um high-resolution mass spec

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
is what hrms is standing for

86
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
these have been developed for the

87
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,598
identification of different cannabinoids

88
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,560
in

89
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,079
cannabis medical extracts the hmrs

90
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,920
technique can define the cannabinoid

91
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,599
profile of cannabis and products which

92
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,799
is very important

93
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,959
current focus is on the main

94
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,959
cannabinoids such as cbd

95
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,158
and thc along with some of the other

96
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
minor cannabinoids

97
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,079
which contribute to the final beneficial

98
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,239
effects so having these are

99
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
knowing these a very precise measurement

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,439
here so you can see look at some of the

101
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,119
differences presented

102
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,079
in that research study that i cited

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
before this is a great way to develop

104
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
this kind of

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,479
a detailed understanding of what is

106
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,840
actually in

107
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,518
that cannabis plant where it actually

108
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,080
has produced

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,120
now the macro to the microscopic views

110
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
as we kind of can see

111
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,519
in the example here the leaf of a

112
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,598
typical cannabis plant

113
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,719
if we zoom in i would say the lethal

114
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,280
typical chemist plant then we have that

115
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,680
zoom in

116
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,199
version here with the magnifying leaf

117
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
showing the individual trichome

118
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,399
structures

119
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,399
then we have the surface swab of that

120
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,080
leaf conducting right here in the lab

121
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
then the mass spec of that sample

122
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,480
collected so this is kind of the general

123
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
process

124
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,000
of how we go about sampling that plant

125
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,519
and developing

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,598
those various particular mass spec

127
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
graphs there this would be the process

128
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,959
that would be utilizing as you can see

129
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,119
it's actually taking direct samples from

130
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,920
the plant and getting an exact kind of

131
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,200
profile

132
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,598
which is great when we're looking at

133
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,679
trying to evaluate what compounds

134
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,639
particularly canvas plants may or may

135
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,640
not be producing
