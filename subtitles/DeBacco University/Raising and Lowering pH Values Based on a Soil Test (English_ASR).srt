1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,280
okay you've gotten your soil test back

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,679
and you're looking at your ph

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,318
value and if you need to raise it or

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,039
lower it

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,439
this debaco university video will help

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:17,920
you

7
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:17,920
with that process

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,400
all right let's look at raising and

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,118
lowering ph values

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,479
based on your soil test results well

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,118
first off you have to know what your

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,719
plant prefers because there is no ideal

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,600
ph across all plants there is ideal ph

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,759
for different plants

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,679
some like very acidic moderately acidic

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,679
slightly acidic or sometimes even

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,359
very alkaline we can see a list here of

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,280
plant preferred ph's

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,039
the optimum ph is based on the plant

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
species you are growing

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,039
most garden plants prefer a soil ph

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,878
between 6.0 and 6.8

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,640
just to give you a general range this

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,079
includes cannabis however hydroponic

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
growers tend to favor

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
a slightly more acidic end of that range

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
of 5.5

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,079
to 6.5 notable exceptions are

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,479
acid-loving blueberries which prefer a

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,478
ph

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,640
of around 4.5 to 5.3 potato varieties

32
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,840
without scab resistance are also grown

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,719
in lower ph

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,359
and by lower ph i mean the 5.2 to 5.4

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,438
range

36
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,959
simply put to inhibit the growth of this

37
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,719
disease organism

38
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,118
so again look at the different lists

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,319
here see what target ph range you will

40
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,359
be targeting to match

41
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,000
your particular plant now also region

42
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,040
can impact

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,159
ph geographic area can also influence

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,759
native soil ph generally soil ph by

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,799
region on the east coast here we're

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,560
looking at usually the 4.8 to 5.5 range

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
midwest you're talking that six to six

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
and a half in the southwest around that

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,799
7.5 to 8.5

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,240
so depending on the region of country

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,960
that you live in here in the united

52
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,078
states

53
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,078
you might be looking at more of

54
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,319
looking at raising your ph maybe more

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,559
lowering your ph there

56
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,478
now getting your plants to that optimum

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,519
ph range how does that kind of play into

58
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,039
things here

59
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,718
well you will likely need to raise or

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
lower your soil's ph to reach the

61
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,399
optimum levels for your plants

62
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
and again we're looking at trying to be

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,919
as close to that optimal range

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
as possible because you could get into

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,119
toxic or root damaging conditions

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,199
or also poor nutrition based on the

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
nutrients not being available to your

68
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,639
plants

69
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,238
so if you want to raise this oil ph well

70
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,719
you're looking at typically adding

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
a limestone so ground limestone is

72
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,959
commonly used to help

73
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,598
raise soil's ph lab

74
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,199
soil testing labs will often offer

75
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,399
recommendations that's based on the

76
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,399
actual ph

77
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
the plants being grown and the buffering

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,360
capacity of the soil

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
so it's good to use their

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,319
recommendations at least as a good

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
starting point

82
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,560
typically the lower the ph in the more

83
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
clay and organic matter in the soil

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,239
the greater amount of limestones

85
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,280
required to raise the soil ph to the

86
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,480
target level

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,479
that'd be important if you're looking at

88
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,079
comparing different fields they might be

89
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,679
at the same ph level

90
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
but why does the lab recommend different

91
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,760
results for one versus another

92
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,560
it could have to do with the particular

93
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,000
content

94
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,959
of that soil now we're making limestone

95
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,039
applications just in general limestone

96
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
recommendations by the soil lab are made

97
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,639
in tons per acre

98
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,239
or can be pounds per hundred or pounds

99
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,000
per thousand square feet

100
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
so know the square foot of the area of

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
growth space that you'll be growing in

102
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,759
limestone needs to react with the soil

103
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
so it's highly recommended to be tilled

104
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,158
incorporated into the soil in some way

105
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,080
we don't just want to go through apply

106
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,359
it to the surface and then walk away

107
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,560
can you apply it to the surface that's

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,799
fine and then go through making sure

109
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
you're working it into that soil

110
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,599
if you're not going to incorporate lime

111
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,199
then apply no more than 50 to 75 pounds

112
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,798
per thousand square feet

113
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,798
or five to seven and a half pounds per

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,239
hundred square feet to the soil surface

115
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,920
at any one time reapply one to six

116
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,158
month intervals until the total

117
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,598
recommendation is administered

118
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,280
and that's again important for that

119
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,878
surface application you don't want to

120
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,640
create a solid little

121
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,158
layer of that you want to give it some

122
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,119
time to kind of work in hopefully with

123
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,840
rain events

124
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
into that soil profile now what we're

125
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
looking at are

126
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,840
limestone options while it is all

127
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,719
limestone there are actually additional

128
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,878
options

129
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,080
the main two being either powdered or

130
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,159
pelletized

131
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,199
this will take several months to a year

132
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,759
for soil ph to increase

133
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,280
i have moved ph in winter months so it

134
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,000
doesn't necessarily take a full calendar

135
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,918
year

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,519
however it is possible to move a full

137
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,319
point even over winter months as i

138
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,560
mentioned

139
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,079
if you're using powdered lime is applied

140
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,918
and tilled into the soil

141
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,918
because the pelletized while it's the

142
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,359
same type of lime

143
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,359
that powdered lime can be a little more

144
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,960
quicker acting because it's got a

145
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
greater surface area so it can come in

146
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,279
contact with the soda particles a little

147
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,758
quicker

148
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,279
but it is much more difficult to apply

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,080
the pelletized line the little pellets

150
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,478
here is much

151
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,918
easier to apply but may take longer to

152
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,279
adjust the ph

153
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,120
why this be the same if they're both

154
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,159
limestone well they're essentially both

155
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
limestone

156
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,680
but inside a small coating here of the

157
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
pelletize

158
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,759
to make the application easier as a

159
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,560
result that coating causes a slight

160
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
delay

161
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,639
as the coating dissolves before it can

162
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,839
kind of start to adjust the soil ph

163
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,840
so just keep that in mind now the option

164
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,239
options within limestone more than just

165
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,638
the type of kind of

166
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,519
pelletized or powdered we also have

167
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,199
options

168
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,879
here of dolomitic calcitic and hydrated

169
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
so many gross things there's just lime

170
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,399
but there's actually three main types

171
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,079
there's dolomitic limestone which is

172
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,719
calcium carbonate plus magnesium

173
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,560
carbonate

174
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
this is the most commonly found lime

175
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,639
contains elevated levels of magnesium

176
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,000
which can be an added bonus for some

177
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,600
growers then there's

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
calcitic lime which is which is a

179
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,560
calcium carbonate it's often called high

180
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
cal lime

181
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,478
and it lacks those high levels of

182
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,159
magnesium it's used if magnesium levels

183
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,800
are determined to already be at the

184
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
optimum

185
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,079
level then there's hydrated lime which

186
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
is calcium hydroxide

187
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,439
it's a very quick acting lime it may

188
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,038
change the ph quickly

189
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,639
but keep in mind that while it may do

190
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,959
that it does not have as long residual

191
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,199
and change and alteration of the ph as

192
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,918
the other lime options mentioned

193
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,840
also a hydrated lime is a mucous

194
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,120
membrane irritant so be careful if

195
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,679
you're applying it

196
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,280
it can really irritate your nose your

197
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
mouth anywhere and it's very

198
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,478
especially if it's powdered just be

199
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,918
mindful when you're going through and

200
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,680
apply it and that's why you'll typically

201
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,439
see the big label here

202
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
warning keypad reach of children and

203
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,800
read the label for cautions

204
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,319
now in the opposite case of the lime

205
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,160
we're now looking at we're going to

206
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,360
lower the soil's ph with that we need a

207
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,680
soil acidifier

208
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,800
which is typically sulfur or ferrous

209
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,439
sulfate

210
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
these are often recommended to lower ph

211
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,038
just as we saw with the limestone these

212
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,360
recommendations are usually offered

213
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,639
in tons per acre or pounds per hundred

214
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,160
or thousand square feet

215
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
so it's important to know your growing

216
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,800
space depending on what the soil

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
is made out of or what the components

218
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,960
are

219
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
it may alter the lowering ph the sulfur

220
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,758
recommendations

221
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,960
both of these compounds though do need

222
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
to react with the soil just like the

223
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,399
lime

224
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,079
does so it's important to incorporate it

225
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,038
into the soil profile

226
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,279
however you're not going to be

227
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,879
incorporating it the sulfur should be

228
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,679
applied no more than 400 pounds to the

229
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,639
acre so this

230
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,079
at the soil surface any one time uh to

231
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,960
establish plants

232
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,680
per year just to give you an idea sulfur

233
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,918
in that fair

234
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,038
sulfate so keep in mind that elemental

235
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,799
sulfur

236
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,959
spring applications and incorporation

237
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,520
work best since the acidification

238
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,680
process

239
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,959
is based on soil biology and not a

240
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,879
chemical reaction

241
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,000
soil temperatures should be above 55

242
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,918
degrees fahrenheit

243
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,279
and have good aeration so the bacteria

244
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,318
can be active and

245
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,159
cause that now reduction in ph if this

246
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,000
feels anaerobic or water logged

247
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,759
the sulfur gets converted into hydrogen

248
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,959
sulfide which actually can damage

249
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,038
plants that's why you want it to be

250
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,000
aerated and well drained now

251
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,878
ferrous sulfate is more costly to use in

252
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,959
sulfur

253
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,039
it's eight times uh you need eight times

254
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,758
more fair sulfa is needed in elemental

255
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,839
sulfur

256
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,919
however it is quicker acting than sulfur

257
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,399
so again pros and cons depending on what

258
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,799
type of

259
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,478
area you might be dealing with now you

260
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,160
want to avoid aluminum sulfate and

261
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,279
sulfuric acid because these seem like

262
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,039
they might be good options

263
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,038
but aluminum sulfate can be toxic to

264
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,598
certain plants for example blueberries

265
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,519
if high rates are applied irrigating

266
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,399
with dilute sulfuric acid can lower the

267
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,159
soil ph

268
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,679
but can damage plants and can corrode

269
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
metal pipes fittings

270
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,439
and irrigation systems so while these

271
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,639
sound like they would lower ph and

272
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,120
technically they will

273
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
there's some negative side effects that

274
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,360
don't allow them to really be made

275
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,639
recommended in an agricultural type

276
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,158
setting

277
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,000
lastly as i mentioned before you want to

278
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,599
follow the lab recommendations is

279
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,958
based on the lab that you select they're

280
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
going to take the ph they're going to

281
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,598
take your soil type they're going to

282
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
take buffering capacities

283
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
and they're going to go through and kind

284
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,360
of utilize all those factors

285
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,879
to give you a good recommendation if you

286
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
don't necessarily 100 agree with that

287
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,759
recommendation you might want to favor

288
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,519
maybe on the slightly lower side

289
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,799
or really use their recommendation as a

290
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,720
good starting point

291
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,000
and then see how your soil reacts over

292
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,560
time and base your repeated applications

293
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,240
on that so hopefully this was helpful

294
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,518
and allowing you to understand if you

295
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,560
want to raise or lower

296
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,560
your soil ph
