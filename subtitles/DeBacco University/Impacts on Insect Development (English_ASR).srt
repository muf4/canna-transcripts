1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,599
in this tobacco university video we'll

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,879
be looking at impacts

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,558
on insect development so while there are

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,960
many we're going to focus on a few

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,919
very important key ones here related to

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,759
forensics

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,679
to take into consideration when we're

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,080
trying to time out the development of

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,039
certain

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,839
insects so keep in mind that stages

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
follow

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,839
a pattern within insect development so

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,518
because there's a progression of the

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,559
insect life cycle that follows this

15
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,038
predictable

16
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,000
unknown pattern as a result the rate of

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
stage transition

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,119
can be altered by various conditions and

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,359
knowing

20
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,238
what that alteration may be can allow us

21
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,960
to kind of

22
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,399
develop an idea of exactly the time or

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,439
backtrack that time

24
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,600
to when the original first kind of

25
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,519
time of death may have occurred which is

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,559
important when we're investigating crime

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,399
scenes

28
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,759
so keep in mind temperature is kind of

29
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,039
one of the major ones we want to keep

30
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,039
track of because insects

31
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,039
are ectothermic meaning they're cold

32
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
blooded their body temperatures are

33
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
largely dictated by the outside

34
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,198
temperature so only when the outside

35
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,239
temperature warms an insect's internal

36
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,079
body temperature

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,439
to a critical level can the insect

38
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,118
become active

39
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,919
it's becoming active what's allowed to

40
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,438
do is it can eat and grow at that time

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,799
so keep in mind that temperature is

42
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,239
something we definitely want to be

43
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,320
making note of

44
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,719
and potential previous temperature for

45
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,639
looking at multiple days going back

46
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,920
in time to try to determine the time of

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
death now

48
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,118
insects to calculate the postmortem

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,959
interval well

50
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,478
insects can be used to estimate the time

51
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,640
between death and discovery of the

52
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,519
corpse which is called the post-mortem

53
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
interval

54
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,200
to increase the accuracy temperature

55
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,039
data and identifying

56
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
the presence of drugs in a corpse in

57
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,118
addition to if the corpse was wrapped

58
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
in a material and the conditions it was

59
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,959
exposed to externally

60
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,158
should also be documented because all

61
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,158
these variables

62
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,240
can be kind of factored in to try to

63
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,960
develop the closest possible

64
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,399
estimation to that original point or

65
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,759
time of death

66
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
you can see here definitely how the

67
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,718
incubation temperature and time and

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,920
hours

69
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,559
definitely can have an impact so keeping

70
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
in mind

71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
knowing the weather conditions we're

72
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
talking outside but also knowing

73
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
the conditions the corpse was in and the

74
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,439
conditions that the corpse was found and

75
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
was

76
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,919
wrapped for example some sort of

77
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,039
external wrapping can also

78
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,199
influence those intervals as well now

79
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,959
drugs can also impact the

80
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,878
presence of insects so any drugs present

81
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
in the corpse at the time of death

82
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,159
can be ingested by the insects

83
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,958
themselves and affect the rate of maggot

84
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,639
development

85
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
a drug like cocaine speeds up the

86
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,439
development while some poisons such as

87
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,120
arsenic

88
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,280
and glycosides can also slow it down

89
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,360
so important to know and identify what

90
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,519
drugs may have been present

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,879
here we see a hinge of a person being

92
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,920
exposed to arsenic poisoning through

93
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
contaminated

94
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,000
water over an extended period of time

95
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,719
now all flies keep in mind

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
are not the same so not all fly species

97
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,840
are found everywhere

98
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,959
identifying and document the species is

99
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,800
important

100
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,878
for example this skipper fly is only

101
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,120
found in urban settings and the house

102
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,318
and blowflies are flesh flies that can

103
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,640
be found in both urban

104
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,639
and rural settings so as a result

105
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,799
knowing not only the general species

106
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,318
but also getting to the scientific name

107
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
can also be important

108
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,679
because the flies aren't all the same we

109
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,200
said oh flies were present

110
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
this is where entomologists would come

111
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,439
in and specifically identify that

112
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,039
particular fly which has been really

113
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,598
important for the investigative

114
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,598
process
