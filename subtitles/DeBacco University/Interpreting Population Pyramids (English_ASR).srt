1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,278
okay I have another video on going over

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,898
the basics of population pyramids this

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,259
is involved in interpreting them

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,089
considering these main six categories

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:14,669
percent of dependence in that are

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:18,359
economically active birth rate death

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:21,629
rate infant mortality life expectancy in

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,570
migration all this play into how a

9
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,339
population pyramid can be used to help

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,859
predict the future here going to

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,448
interpret some of these so looking at

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,830
the importance of these its importance

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,920
of population pyramids at the local

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,289
level for policy planning future housing

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,989
estates future schools future jobs

16
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,089
here's a town of Rocky Hill historic

17
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:45,530
populations based on consensus records

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:49,260
well notice here back in 1852 about Oh

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,350
1930 very stable very low in this rapid

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,378
increase this exponential increase

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:58,230
looking more current terms from 2009

22
00:00:54,378 --> 00:01:00,750
2014 we're looking at the median house

23
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:04,018
price about the count of home sales per

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,719
quarter and the price so the number and

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,510
the price so this can help us indicate

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,099
trends of what may occur whether homes

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,930
are cheaper whether expensive whether

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,938
they're trending up or turning down all

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,049
these are involved with population

30
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:21,118
pyramids so they're useful to help track

31
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,130
birth rate death rate infant mortality

32
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,509
and life expectancy we're gonna look at

33
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,629
a couple that are looking more the

34
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,819
large-scale at the country level like a

35
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,578
country of Germany United States Finland

36
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,129
for example they can also be applied to

37
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,828
a local level if you have that data so

38
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,209
for example if more homes for at L they

39
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,699
are needed if there's an aging

40
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,709
population or fewer schools if there's a

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,228
declining birthrate these are kind of

42
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:49,259
ways to consider shifts that should be

43
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:51,450
made to a respective town world

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,790
population distribution urban versus

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,060
rural again urban plus rural after equal

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,009
on a percent resident slow increase or

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,170
predicted increase in the urban

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,540
environment and a decrease in the rural

49
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,000
environment in our births per thousand

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,670
again Africa being at the elevated level

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,530
here so population parents useful

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,119
because they show affects people

53
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,560
migrating into an out of our region or a

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,629
country

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,449
population per square miles is Louisiana

56
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:21,259
how things may change the apportionable

57
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,699
population are economically active and

58
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:25,829
the portion who are dependent on them

59
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,079
the dependency ratio can also impact

60
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,840
that click this world population clock

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,910
kind of a little scary and how rapidly

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,209
increasing overall the world's

63
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:38,489
population is so if you remember back

64
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,959
from some of the slides one of the

65
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,390
previous videos this gives some examples

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,449
when expanding pyramid may look like a

67
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:47,458
negative growth in a stable growth so

68
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,579
looking at the presence here expanding

69
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,129
very high young population very sadly

70
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,260
very low life expectancy negative growth

71
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,919
rate not a lot of new young dependence

72
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:02,519
and stable relatively consistent from

73
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,139
age 60 in the law so we're okay Italy in

74
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,569
particular here remember with our males

75
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,458
here on our females we're going to look

76
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:11,848
specifically at this population how

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,409
things may change well link here and to

78
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,399
some of where I got this information

79
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,379
from

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,090
I think presents a really great way it

81
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,329
helps you interpret these population

82
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,849
pyramids so Italy in 2000 now we have to

83
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,379
remember we have our different regions

84
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,719
that we want to take into cook into

85
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,818
account we want to be looking back at

86
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,979
some of the previous videos help explain

87
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,169
with these may shell this graph in

88
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:38,280
particular stops out 80-plus this is the

89
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:41,458
population over eighty years old now

90
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,318
look at these specific regions or the

91
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,469
thing a declining birthrate here on this

92
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,388
where variant one is pointing to we're

93
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:52,919
two years in the cult of baby boom this

94
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:56,579
is the expanding population here in this

95
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,949
particular age group three were noticing

96
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,560
fewer men due to World War One World War

97
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:05,250
two compared to females so that's why

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,620
there's that's the reason for the less

99
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:11,039
percentage of males versus females in

100
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,129
his particular age group and number five

101
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:17,548
here more 75 is having nine year olds

102
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,769
than 40 and 0 to 4 year olds so again

103
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,870
this is science for the future their

104
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,300
worker shortage and overall declining

105
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,449
populations also comparing different

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,210
regions of this population pyramid

107
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:33,329
in aging population and a declining

108
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:36,289
birthrate things to consider here this

109
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:38,370
is in general what's occurring in Italy

110
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,830
so looking back going back to our

111
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,959
population pyramid four million mm see

112
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:45,149
you scrapped that mean L sighs now we're

113
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:49,349
going to look and see how this may

114
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:51,929
change over time so this is a prediction

115
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:56,970
in the future so if the population in

116
00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:00,329
2000 this is its predicted B in 2025 and

117
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,590
n in 2050 so we'll notice things to flip

118
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:02,729
back for a second we're noticing this

119
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:08,629
change and that's why I kept everything

120
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:11,939
the same so let's again mm mm 25 2015

121
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:16,649
flipping back or noticing this region

122
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:19,110
here and working its way up so 2025

123
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,149
here's that population it shifted up now

124
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,730
we're making the inference that there

125
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:25,709
won't be as high percentage of birthrate

126
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,590
because if we go back to the data we

127
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:32,039
have for 2000 we're noticing a negative

128
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:34,429
growth and this will only get worse as

129
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,840
we go into the future and here's 2050

130
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,810
notice again it's declining birthrate in

131
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:43,049
this large expanse of the older aging

132
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,610
population so the Netherlands this kind

133
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,680
of shows you it I'm looking over a

134
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,389
little bit longer term you can see how

135
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,280
this population is working its way up so

136
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,789
from 1950 there's 60 every ten year

137
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,509
increments this initial boom here

138
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:59,520
working its way through the population

139
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:01,409
and just gives you an idea of how these

140
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,919
pyramids can be used to help predict the

141
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,870
future population periods have different

142
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,270
scales we want to look at the one in

143
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,120
particular that you may be comparing

144
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:14,310
particular country on the state or the

145
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,579
county different areas again it can be

146
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,379
at this town level the state level at

147
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:22,289
the country level of continent level

148
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,920
just be mindful of the scales that you

149
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,180
looking at for the particular pyramid

150
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,689
here is Unites States of America in

151
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,480
general and you can see here's Alaska so

152
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:35,189
here's a very large the state level of

153
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,750
the United States level I should say

154
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:39,959
then we're going down to the state level

155
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,189
here in particular looking at Alaska now

156
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,849
within Alaska

157
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:47,370
we're looking at a small area with in

158
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,620
Alaska there's a lot more specific it

159
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,019
was a major shift yes these are all

160
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,910
people of Alaska these are all Americans

161
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:56,039
but we're looking at this level we see a

162
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,110
major difference compared to what Alaska

163
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,090
in general looks like Alaska also looks

164
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,730
different than just the United States in

165
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:05,609
general so abroad a little bit more

166
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,040
specific in very specific that's a major

167
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,030
shift in males between the ages of 35

168
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,500
and 39 well this particular area it

169
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,899
looks located right here on the

170
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,019
Aleutians if you've seen maybe the show

171
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:23,399
Deadliest Catch lots of fishing industry

172
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,979
tends to be more of a male-dominated job

173
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:28,319
occupation very physically demanding as

174
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,810
a result this area tends to have a

175
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,980
greater percentage of male population

176
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,800
and then go back to that population

177
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,250
pyramid when I was saying 35 to 39 year

178
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,590
olds able to work able to handle the

179
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:45,569
demands and rigors of in this case

180
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:46,859
crabbing or fishing may require human

181
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,449
populations throughout most of history

182
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,420
human populations have been written by

183
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,689
food availability on a food access to an

184
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,210
area disease that may occur and

185
00:07:53,689 --> 00:08:00,810
predators this helps regulate the human

186
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:03,689
population 2,000 years ago human

187
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,519
population was about 130 million it took

188
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,839
a thousand years for it to double and

189
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,789
another 654 to double again however

190
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,529
starting with in 1700 technological

191
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,240
changes gave humans more control over

192
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,729
their environment no longer were

193
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,009
hunter-gatherers using more

194
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:23,610
sophisticated ways to produce food this

195
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:26,399
these changes allows human expansion to

196
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,540
expand the carrying capacity of their

197
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:33,120
habitats leading to this basic rapid and

198
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,279
extremely rapid increase overall in

199
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,560
population because of some of these

200
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,000
advances that we were able to make no

201
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,649
longer hunting and searching for food

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,809
being able to keep a controlled

203
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,139
environment and be very productive in a

204
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,849
very small area human populations

205
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,460
currently human populations great about

206
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,909
1.3 percent annually the doubling time

207
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,720
is only about 54 years so this can be a

208
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,509
little bit scary when we

209
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,269
this exponential curve remember from the

210
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:01,709
one of the previous videos exponential

211
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,230
curves tend to reach some sort of

212
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,609
carrying capacity right now we have no

213
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,110
indication that there's carrying

214
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,688
capacity right now human population

215
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,430
growth is not uniform so it's important

216
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:16,049
to keep that in mind we looked at United

217
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,659
States Alaska and a specific town in

218
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,068
Alaska also our human population growth

219
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:24,149
is different in different regions of the

220
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:25,500
world this is an expansion or prediction

221
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,490
of what's going to happen in the future

222
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,649
remember that carrying capacity

223
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,188
initiative actually taper where that's

224
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,589
going to occur is still unknown a great

225
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:35,669
video link if you're looking at

226
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,829
population pyramids and predicting the

227
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:40,759
future it's about five minute video I

228
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,758
recommend that you watch
