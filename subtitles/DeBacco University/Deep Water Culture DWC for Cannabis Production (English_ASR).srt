1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
if you want to learn about deep water

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,798
culture then this debaco university

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,490
video

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:13,519
is for you

5
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:14,880
[Music]

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,199
all right let's get into deepwater

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
culture abbreviated dwc for cannabis

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
production

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,759
so the basics of deep water culture are

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,399
the fact that it does not use a growing

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
medium or

12
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,640
substrate but instead plants roots are

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
held in a special pot or container

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,278
we see that right over on this side over

15
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,558
here with a five gallon pail system

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,880
and some of the components that's

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,280
required on this other side we see kind

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,960
of represented in a cannabis grow

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
in what this system entails is that the

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
roots are essentially immersed in a pool

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,759
of aerated

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,640
nutrient-rich water which allow for easy

23
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,159
access to

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,320
oxygen and nutrients for the plant

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,839
now the attractiveness of this system is

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
that it can be automated

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
so there's no need and there's also no

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,479
need to worry about over or under

29
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,558
watering the plants the system can

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,038
easily be automated once initially set

31
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,799
up

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,480
however this may not be the best option

33
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,679
for new growers due to the lack of

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,840
buffering ability

35
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,200
of the water solution so growers have

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
little room for error

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,240
it's great when it looks like this and

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
this is definitely possible

39
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,158
but if there is potential for ph swings

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,520
that aren't monitored or a new grower

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
isn't attentive to those

42
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,239
this can cause the entire plant to die

43
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,079
in a relatively short period of time

44
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,798
the basic setup to this is that there's

45
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,000
a reservoir a dwc net pots

46
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
which kind of will support that

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,719
substrate water-soluble nutrient

48
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,640
and then an air pump as well and they're

49
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,679
typically sold as kits as we can see

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,320
here

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,920
now the water nutrient reservoir the

52
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,359
reservoir contains a water-soluble

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
nutrient solution

54
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,759
that the plant's roots grow in we see

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,920
that right here to help avoid potential

56
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
algal growth the container should be

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,759
light tight

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
but not necessarily airtight meaning we

59
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,759
don't want to have

60
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,759
light getting in here but we don't

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,399
necessarily want to completely solidly

62
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,640
sealed

63
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,599
we do potentially want some exchange of

64
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
air

65
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,519
some systems are sized for one plant

66
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
others are sized to hold

67
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,599
multiple plants since all plants will be

68
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
in the same solution it is advised to

69
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,318
only grow the same type of plant

70
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,840
at the same stage in the same reservoir

71
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,439
if you're growing one in flower one in

72
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,360
veg one propagation that could cause

73
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,680
some potential nutrient imbalances

74
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
or really reduce your overall efficiency

75
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,719
of plant production

76
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,640
now if we're looking at the dwc or net

77
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,959
pots these have a

78
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
wide or large mesh to allow support of

79
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
the root system

80
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,598
but still provide plenty of room for the

81
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
roots to expand there's nothing special

82
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,719
so they can be homemade but are often

83
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,480
store-bought to allow for

84
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,280
standardization as we can see right here

85
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,719
below me

86
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,719
and there's an example of some homemade

87
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,080
ones some growers may choose to fill

88
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,080
these with some inert medium

89
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
but this is often not required unless

90
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
plants are initially placed in these

91
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,039
containers when they're very small

92
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,560
here we see some growing pebbles used

93
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,000
sometimes rockwool is used

94
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
but you can some of the plants a little

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
bit older just basically put them right

96
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,719
in the pot with no need for any

97
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,159
additional substrates now the water

98
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,759
soluble nutrient solution you want to

99
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,359
follow the recommended rates of

100
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,799
nutrients based on the fertilizer

101
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
company's suggestions

102
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,400
because that is a great starting point

103
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,920
or when in doubt favor a little bit less

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,439
however the grower is responsible for

105
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,518
regulation of the ph

106
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,719
to ensure the nutrient availability for

107
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,360
efficient growth

108
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,919
the target ph should be around 5.8 with

109
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,159
an acceptable range of 5.5 to 6.5

110
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,919
typically a little bit more acidic than

111
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,479
we would in a natural

112
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,199
soil based solution to ensure growers

113
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,000
need to have

114
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,238
a continual water monitor for ph but

115
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,759
nutrient concentrations in temperature

116
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
are also environmental factors to

117
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,318
monitor as well ph is very important but

118
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
don't only monitor ph the concentration

119
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,958
of those nutrients and the temperature

120
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,719
of that nutrient solution

121
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,840
are other things growers should be

122
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,080
monitoring and keeping a continual eye

123
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,080
on

124
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
and then some will go through and add an

125
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,040
additional air pump

126
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,719
so a general rule the air pump should

127
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,479
apply at least double

128
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,560
the liters per hour of the volume of

129
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,399
your reservoir the whole goal here is to

130
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,519
keep the nutrient solution moving

131
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,039
and also allow fresh oxygen and air to

132
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,000
those root systems will be

133
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,878
in growing in those water environment

134
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
for example

135
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,399
if you had a hundred liter water tank

136
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,039
you should have a

137
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
air pump that would supply at least 200

138
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,079
liters per hour

139
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,680
growers are advised to get backups to

140
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,959
ensure quick change if a pump

141
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
fails because that is one of the

142
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,720
downfalls of the system that it is

143
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
dependent on electricity

144
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,919
so hopefully these little tips and kind

145
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,840
of

146
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,680
brief overview of the deepwater culture

147
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,599
gives you a better understanding

148
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
of how this can be utilized for cannabis

149
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
production
