1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,829
here we'll look at pattern recognition

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,810
so high-low bunch of shapes here can you

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,759
recognize them as any particular objects

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,080
if I kind of move that shape over now

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,820
looks like I have a mug and a suitcase

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,199
here another example of pattern

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,990
recognition that if you're looking at a

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,489
bunch of patch of clover can you pick

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,289
out the four-leaf clover if there's one

10
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:21,329
there can you recognize that pattern how

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,880
it differs from what's around it despite

12
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,159
the similarities so getting more deep

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:29,070
details of pattern recognition well it

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,018
can be an object or an event so object

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,270
examples would be eye color handwriting

16
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,320
fingerprints these are all can get into

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,719
certain patterns

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,670
there's also gestures or routines can be

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,879
a pattern that we may be at a seat or

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,469
recognize with certain people patterns

21
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,259
in everyday life so how do they relate

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,629
well loan and credit card applications

23
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:51,359
income dependence to determine whether

24
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:53,519
the someone is worthy of getting that

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,859
credit that's a pattern how are they

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,390
behaving over time dating services use

27
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,350
age hobbies height to determine

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,270
desirability

29
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,280
that's another pattern in online pages

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,960
when we keyword search descriptions to

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,060
find documents that's looking for a

32
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,540
pattern in the particular document or

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,350
text block pattern recognition

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,970
applications

35
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,669
well pattern recognition is used to give

36
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,500
human identification it intelligence to

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,659
machines which required for image

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,478
processing it's used to extract features

39
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,090
from given video or image samples it can

40
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,859
also use this a computer this is where

41
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,560
artificial intelligence can come in and

42
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,328
pick up the faces and be able to analyze

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,829
those faces and compare them to a data

44
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,728
bank for example that's an example of

45
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,889
pattern recognition also similar objects

46
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,319
classifying then into different classes

47
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,000
or subgroups for example we have a large

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,779
population looking at males versus

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,790
females that's one way of classifying

50
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,710
people in this image we could be looking

51
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,700
at a whole multitude of ways of

52
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,989
recognizing similarity of objects

53
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,310
methods of pattern classification well

54
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,140
they can separate data belong to

55
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,840
different classes when new data comes in

56
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,968
need to classify it into a category so

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,759
if we're looking at you know red versus

58
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,649
blue of fruits versus the black if we

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,209
have another strawberry come in and

60
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,649
we're looking at that's going to be red

61
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,900
a bit an apple come in if it's a red

62
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,469
apple are going to classify that and

63
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,659
happen

64
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,569
method of putting that in a separate

65
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:21,139
case or class there's variability

66
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,599
there's intra and Inter class

67
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:26,849
variability intra-class different

68
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,189
typefaces of the letter T if we go down

69
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,599
with the different T that be intra inter

70
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,819
class variability B letters and numbers

71
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,189
that look it's similar so for example

72
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,870
the letter B in the number 8 it's an

73
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:39,240
inter class variability they look very

74
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,680
similar versus here they're all the

75
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,780
letter T but they have different

76
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,490
typefaces so they're intra-class

77
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,659
variability there's some of the

78
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,409
challenges we have when we're looking at

79
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,609
how do we class certain things

80
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,560
classification versus clustering well

81
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,030
classifications recognition we have our

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,039
clustering so here's our classification

83
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,199
of low-risk consumers and Harris

84
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,109
consumers we can cluster them as these

85
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:04,409
these groups here it just helps us to

86
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,090
determine when we get new data where

87
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,669
would that most likely fit or what can

88
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,640
we kind of gain from that new data that

89
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:14,429
comes in license-plate recognition is

90
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,259
one example is where an automatic number

91
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,569
plate recognition can be used to store

92
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,219
the images captured by cameras as well

93
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,919
as a text from the license plate with

94
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,709
some I figure Bailey to store this

95
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,030
photograph of the driver so we kind of

96
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,590
have that connection between that

97
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,870
license plate movie of that car that

98
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,560
time and potentially even going to that

99
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,180
driver

100
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,830
I've been important for crime-scene

101
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,719
investigation by looking at tracing

102
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,920
where someone went well I simply

103
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,979
recognitions are very important for

104
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,809
pattern recognition well cell

105
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,030
fingerprint classification we have five

106
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,310
categories arches tented arches all of

107
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,530
our loops radio loops whirls all these

108
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,449
can be a way of identifying certain

109
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,979
patterns and classifying them and

110
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,379
comparing them to a known set or

111
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,789
database yes face detection that's a

112
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,039
computer that dentists eyes human faces

113
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,139
and digital images this can also be used

114
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,269
with face detection software within

115
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,069
cameras potentially for focusing and

116
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,129
things like that obvious can be

117
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,169
automatic as well medical applications

118
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,699
it's gonna be important where our skin

119
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,829
cancer detection or what's the normal

120
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,389
what's not what fits into what pattern

121
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,189
being able to recognize something that

122
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,959
looks and different it's important and

123
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:21,689
these are all kind of evidence of

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,910
potential on skin cancers just based on

125
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:26,189
the image here depicted in all these

126
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,159
different sizes different than a freckle

127
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:31,019
for example or more

128
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:32,219
conveyor belts they also have pattern

129
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,959
recognition these are typically

130
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,150
computer-based but they can also be

131
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,579
human days whereas optical sorters can

132
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:41,068
recognize objects colors size its shape

133
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,079
structural or chemical composition can

134
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,250
allocate it into different areas this

135
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,529
can be achieved in a non-restrictive

136
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,240
hundred percent inspection in line at

137
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,679
full production volumes aligned list

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,110
ensure we're having consistent product

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,550
coming out or we're allocating out into

140
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,680
different areas different sizes or

141
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,348
different colors a lot of you do with

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,150
automation and optical eyes but this is

143
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:03,360
important that those computers can

144
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:05,310
recognize patterns now from patterns we

145
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,169
can have feature extraction so let's

146
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,538
assume a fisherman told us that sea bass

147
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:12,209
is doing a larger I should say longer

148
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:14,250
than a salmon there's a sea bass here's

149
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:16,168
a salmon we can use a length as a

150
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,180
feature and decide between sea bass and

151
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,818
salmon according to the threshold on

152
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,500
length so how should we choose the

153
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,050
threshold we need to accumulate some

154
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,000
data at least initially so here's our

155
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,028
length histogram looking at different

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,060
the fish here even though the sea bass

157
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:34,978
is longer than salmon on the average

158
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,528
there are some there are many examples

159
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:39,718
in this case where the fish this does

160
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:40,949
not hold true so here's our salmon these

161
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:42,959
are sea bass you can see that there's

162
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,199
definitely some indications where there

163
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,689
are some longer salmon than CBS and some

164
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,580
longer CBS and then salmon in some cases

165
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,199
but we develop that threshold where is

166
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,478
that kind of breaking point that we can

167
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,080
kind of say most the time it's true for

168
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,209
one or the other so average lateness at

169
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,370
histogram well looking here it seems

170
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:04,528
easier to choose a threshold at X but we

171
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,569
still cannot make this perfect decision

172
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:08,870
so here we're saying this is most likely

173
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,250
where the salmon are going to be

174
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,750
different than the sea bass where that

175
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,088
average lightness or looking at

176
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,379
different kind of colorations we can see

177
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:18,538
there's an always hold true because

178
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,319
there's definitely a area here where

179
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:23,449
most of the time that does hold true

180
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,770
Multi featured so this can improve

181
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,838
recognition accuracy I'm just using one

182
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:30,028
of those features we can have multiple

183
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:31,620
features we might to be able to use more

184
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:33,088
than one single features may not yield

185
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,978
the best performance using it

186
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,788
combinations features may yield better

187
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,228
performance

188
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:38,728
that's what's army knife it's got

189
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:40,859
another bunch of different things it's

190
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:41,609
multi feature can be used in a variety

191
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,949
of situations

192
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,900
using our past example we can use the

193
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,490
lightness of the coloration as well as

194
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,718
the width of the length of those fish

195
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:54,389
physical size how many features do we

196
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:55,829
include well this gets interesting does

197
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,329
adding more features always improve its

198
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:58,139
performance well more is not always

199
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:00,209
better

200
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,579
there could be redundancy or over

201
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:05,068
complication to occur so we had a little

202
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:07,139
far side Gary Larson cartoon pull out

203
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,310
pull out hidden artery it's getting too

204
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,840
much blood in this case there's a

205
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,110
certain point there's that ideal amount

206
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,478
then if you go over and above you can

207
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,408
actually cause a negative feature to

208
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:20,848
occur or get less useful data from that

209
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:23,728
so we classify things how to classify

210
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:25,620
things partition the feature space into

211
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:28,529
two regions by finding the decision

212
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,598
boundary that minimizes error no say

213
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:32,638
this is minimize error it doesn't

214
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,408
necessarily eliminate error we should

215
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,150
find the optimal decision boundary so

216
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:39,000
how do we go about finding this boundary

217
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:41,038
of our classification we have a

218
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,930
complexity models perfect classification

219
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,060
performance and training data is

220
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,180
possible by choosing a more complex

221
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,120
model however this can lead to

222
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,340
overfitting the data so it said of art a

223
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,079
simple line technically there's some of

224
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,028
those pink dots over here and some of

225
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,859
the black dots here well if we over fit

226
00:07:57,028 --> 00:08:01,379
that model get too complex so we kind of

227
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,120
create this little crazy line here not

228
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,699
probably the best case not really useful

229
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,129
data but we kind of want where it's

230
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,900
mostly true doesn't always have to be

231
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,389
truce is over fitting the data sets

232
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,788
they're mostly vitro so a lot of times

233
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:18,269
that we form that generalization we

234
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:19,800
produce that kind of a simpler model so

235
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,408
generalization is defined by the ability

236
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,960
to classify produced to correct results

237
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:26,418
on novel patterns how to improve the

238
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,068
generation of the performance

239
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,870
well more training examples better model

240
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:33,089
estimates the simpler models usually

241
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,310
yield better performance so again while

242
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:37,589
the complex model may be accurate just

243
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,478
about all the time this simpler model

244
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:41,669
makes a lot more sense it's accurate

245
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,370
most of the time so when we're looking

246
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:45,778
at generalizing for a pattern it may not

247
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,909
work a hundred percent of the time but

248
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,189
in this case it's very easy to see with

249
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:52,139
new data that may come in where we would

250
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,149
classify that I just gave you a random

251
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,409
data point and said is that most likely

252
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,779
a salmon or a seed

253
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,309
and the point in it in this region who

254
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,659
say it's more likely to be a sea bass if

255
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:02,339
it was in this region what could it be

256
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,079
as salmon because of this simpler

257
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,149
delineation model makes it a lot easier

258
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,160
here with this complex model we kind of

259
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,679
get lost and kind of glean less

260
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,179
information in total so generalization

261
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,309
would be careful at how gentle you make

262
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,620
certain statements but in many cases

263
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:18,629
they can yield a more simpler model that

264
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,879
can potentially have better results when

265
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,879
trying to classify new data
