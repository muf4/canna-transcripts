1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,089
so I want to briefly cover gross space

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,219
humidity because it's something that's

3
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:08,399
often forgotten about if not treated

4
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,980
properly can drastically impact all your

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
plants that you're trying to grow so

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,700
first off what is humidity it's the

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,379
moisture in the air like this kind of

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,028
like fog in the air if you will it's

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,460
kind of that hanging humidity hanging

10
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,768
moisture temperature though does affect

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,539
the amount of water air can hold and

12
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,919
that's an important factor to keep in

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,289
mind that that temperature regulation

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,080
will also directly impact your humidity

15
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,669
warmer air can hold more moisture also

16
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,519
moisture holding capacity doubles every

17
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,468
twenty degrees Fahrenheit increase in

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,820
temperature this is why typically in the

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,009
morning and the cool mornings you'll

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,840
find dew on the grass because that

21
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,699
moisture that was in the air can come

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,280
out of that air and then attach the

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,770
surfaces of the grass blades relating

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,140
this to your grow area on the target

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,539
levels will vary with the stage of the

26
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,890
plant so clones are 70 to 90 percent

27
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,719
human it would be ideal that high

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,039
humidity environment then as they

29
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,469
progressing get older you're slowly

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,260
reduced that humidity digit here to 50

31
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,060
to 60 percent flying 40 to 60 and then

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,118
the curing room should be the driest a

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,890
maximum of 45 to 55 percent humidity

34
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,510
there so you can see the spider webs

35
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,030
here showing that varying amount of

36
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,950
immediate bring about a moisture it's

37
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,320
important to keep a track of it and also

38
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,390
know what stage your plants are in and

39
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,639
about where you should be as far as TV

40
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,890
goes so you're reducing the stress on

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,840
those plants any temperature as it said

42
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,739
can influence that so it's kind of

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,990
important that these two things

44
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,618
correlate together for an efficient grow

45
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,618
operation
