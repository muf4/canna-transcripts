1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
so you may have heard that they're going

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,398
to get in the autopsy results from

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,359
a victim or a body well what does this

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,879
exactly mean

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,039
well here at tobacco university with

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,839
this video of autopsy basics we're going

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,160
to go over

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,679
some of the background regarding

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,719
autopsies

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,399
so first off when an autopsy in general

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,239
it's a basically it's an internal

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,239
medical examination of a body

13
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,159
used to determine the cause and

14
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,198
circumstances of the death that's the

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
entire goal

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,880
of performing or conducting an autopsy

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,840
now keep in mind that there are two

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,679
different

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,120
terms that sometimes use interchangeably

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,119
and they really shouldn't be

21
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,199
one is a medical examiner and one is a

22
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,399
coroner a medical examiner is a

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,359
government official

24
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
which is always a physician and often a

25
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,719
forensic pathologist

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
and charged with the investigating

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,198
sudden and unexpected death

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,520
deaths or deaths from injuries the

29
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,399
coroner is an elected official with

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,960
death investigation duties that signs

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,198
the death

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,799
certificate so keep in mind these are

33
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,399
distinctly different people

34
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,920
they once a government official wants an

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,280
elected official and they have

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
very distinctive and different

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
backgrounds so these terms should not

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,920
be used interchangeably now death is

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
defined as

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
we're trying to determine here the end

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
of life is to

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
put it simply it's characterized by

43
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,199
stopping of blood circulation

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
and brain activity when the heart stops

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
beating oxygen is deprived from the body

46
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,118
and the cells will begin to die at that

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,200
point

48
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,400
once enough cells die life cannot be

49
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,320
restarted

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,799
so we're looking at this is how our

51
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,679
defining death here

52
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,079
the goal of autopsies so the whole point

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
of

54
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,719
providing them is to try to determine

55
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
the manner of death which is the means

56
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,000
by which the person

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
perished the cause of death which is the

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,799
reason why they died

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
the mechanism of death which is the

60
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
specific body failure that may have

61
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,719
occurred

62
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,319
and the time of death is referring to

63
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,879
when the person actually

64
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,478
died now the manner of death there's

65
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,798
different categories that can be placed

66
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,759
in

67
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
there could be natural as if this is

68
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,239
caused or determined to be caused by

69
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,040
disease

70
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,399
cancer physical injury stroke or heart

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,800
attack and occurred

72
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,639
only or solely by those then there's

73
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,360
accidental if it occurs without apparent

74
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,159
intent

75
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,879
there's suicide if caused by the

76
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,199
deceased

77
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,959
person or individual homicide is defined

78
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,799
as if someone other than deceased

79
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,560
caused it and then we have suicide and

80
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
homicide examples such as shooting

81
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,280
burning poisoning hang drowning or

82
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,919
suffocation these are all kind of manner

83
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
of death

84
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,000
categories the autopsy could classify

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,959
death as when we have causes of death

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,919
which there are

87
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,598
many uh and this is the simple reason

88
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,119
why they died we just see annually

89
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,119
number of deaths caused in the world in

90
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,959
2016 right above me

91
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
with uh cardiovascular disease and

92
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,319
cancers being at the very top of the

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
list here

94
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,679
and we can kind of see everything else

95
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,439
again projected all those numbers in

96
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
millions of deaths annually

97
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,359
looking at the world population for the

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
year 2016.

99
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
because you have a little zoomed in

100
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,119
version here the top 10

101
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,079
global causes of death for 2016 again

102
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,519
expressed in

103
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
millions of people then we get the

104
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,640
mechanism of

105
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,759
death so what the mechanism of death

106
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,919
would hear

107
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,518
is we're trying to describe the specific

108
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,559
change in the body that brought about

109
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,680
the cessation of

110
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,280
life what was the kind of the method at

111
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
which that occurred

112
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
if someone has been shot they may have

113
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,719
died from loss of blood for example

114
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,318
someone dies of a heart attack they may

115
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,919
die from pulmonary arrest

116
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,598
and if someone is strangled they may die

117
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,919
from affixiation so this is looking at

118
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,919
the

119
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,280
mechanism of death and here's a sample

120
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,798
kind of death certificate

121
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,000
just provided here just you can kind of

122
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,560
get an idea of what's included there

123
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and lastly we have the time of death so

124
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,479
a lot of times forensic investigators

125
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,919
are trying to estimate or determine what

126
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,518
time this was

127
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,438
and this is simply when the person

128
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,560
actually died and this can help

129
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,120
determine who to

130
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,519
include or to exclude based on alibis or

131
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,438
location at a certain day or time

132
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,039
that's why it's such a crucial part of

133
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,840
the investigation process

134
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,798
to try to determine and pinpoint that

135
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,039
time of death even has to be estimated

136
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
with its great degree of accuracy given

137
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,679
the information

138
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,680
that can be gathered and collected
