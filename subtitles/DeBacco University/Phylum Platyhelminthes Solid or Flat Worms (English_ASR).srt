1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
here we're looking at the animal phylum

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,890
plaid e Hale Minty's cloudy human t's

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,929
kind of a mouthful to say there and I do

4
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,300
my best to kind of give you an

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,129
indication of how to pronounce that I'll

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,780
refer to the video has kind of salad or

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,940
flat worms they don't look like this

8
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,559
very simple but we're getting slightly

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,070
more complex for watching these videos

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,479
in sequence so first off is solid or

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,329
flat worms they have bilateral symmetry

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,510
so this body symmetry differs this

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,979
bilateral symmetry means that only one

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,010
plane can cut through the organism in

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,320
half to produce mirror images so we see

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,570
the example here the butterfly and here

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,450
also of the fern this is bilateral

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,700
symmetry all distinct left and right

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,950
have same here a distinct left and right

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,870
have these flattened have this type of

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,239
symmetry different than some of the

22
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,189
organisms we talked out previously this

23
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,640
allows for a greater degree of

24
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:58,649
specialization to occur now radial

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,600
versus bilateral symmetry so remember

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,120
radial symmetry rail arrangement of

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,129
parts around a central axis with these

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,228
having evidence of bilateral symmetry

29
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,719
there that distinct right and left

30
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:11,099
halves from the mirror image with these

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,950
right and left halves we have a little

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,169
bit more detail we can go into women

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,820
talking about any animal and we want up

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,390
what dorsal versus ventral these are

35
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:23,938
terms I'm going to use we get into body

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,368
systems also so the dorsal side versus

37
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:29,368
the ventral side dorsal side see the

38
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:32,040
fish is up here and here think of the

39
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:33,359
dorsal fin of a dolphin the ventral is

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,509
the underside here and that's the

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,959
ventral side of the fish anterior and

42
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,819
posterior so anteriors towards the head

43
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,339
prostrate towards the tail in this case

44
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,798
so to be the anterior portion here

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,329
there's to be the prosti riyer portion

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,590
here with the tails located so just

47
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,250
again some key terms you should be

48
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,609
familiar with solids and platforms bile

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,530
and symmetry the bilateral symmetry

50
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:02,819
produces these three embryonic layers

51
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,019
thank you mrs. Owens is the three

52
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,789
different types of layers we're going to

53
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,769
talk about now initially they might

54
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,390
sound a little kind of weird but I think

55
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,030
it makes sense once you understand the

56
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,000
terms so ectoderm will develop on the

57
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,810
outer coverings of the body and nervous

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,360
hecto means external i exterior humanity

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,650
of it mesoderm will develop the skeleton

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,980
and muscles that's the middle layer

61
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,080
mesoderm acromion middle layer here i'd

62
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,729
refer to here to the human body in hopes

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,700
that make a little bit better connection

64
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:34,619
so that ectoderm that our body coverings

65
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,339
think that like our skin cells of our

66
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,680
epidermis here mesoderm is those

67
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,650
skeleton muscles in our middle part and

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,330
endoderm the internal layer developed

69
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,969
into digestive organs such as our

70
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,890
intestines so while this is still that

71
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,840
these three layers will still exist for

72
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,119
solomon flatworms even though they don't

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,280
have these complex systems hopefully

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,230
connecting them to these common body

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,180
systems that you're familiar with will

76
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,518
help you remember echoes on the outside

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,530
measures in the middle and endows on the

78
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,670
inside

79
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,370
in addition saladin problems are the

80
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,949
simplest of all bilateral symmetrical

81
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,349
organisms so yes there are more complex

82
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,238
that we've talked about so far but

83
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,219
overall they are the most simple they're

84
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,900
like any internal cavity other than a

85
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,150
digestive tract they're the simplest

86
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,549
animal in which organs are found these

87
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,680
are called a Sosua mates we see that

88
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,469
everything here this is their gut region

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,780
is their ectoderm here's their mesoderm

90
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,489
here and an inner would be their gut and

91
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,359
that's about it so what they look like

92
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,620
very very simple here this is a real

93
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,140
world image what they look like most

94
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,789
problems are parasitic though some are

95
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,349
free-living and flat ones range in size

96
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,840
from less than a millimeter to many

97
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,789
meters long see here's like a tapeworm

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,319
extremely long others are very very

99
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:54,000
teeny-tiny celery flat worms they have

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,639
actually gone through a process called

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,799
degenerative evolution parasitic

102
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,689
flatworms lifestyles resulted in the

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,150
eventual loss of features not used or

104
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,090
needed by the parasite example parasite

105
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,469
flat ones don't need high spots

106
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,479
philosophy church that lacked adaptive

107
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,579
purpose for a parrot ism is often called

108
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,169
degenerative evolution think of them

109
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,139
it's like gating features and then that

110
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,699
using them and then kind of losing them

111
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,470
over time it's kind of evolution kind of

112
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,740
going backwards simply because those

113
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,169
advancements are not needed it's an

114
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,240
example a close-up of a tapeworm

115
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:27,859
tapeworms are a classic example of this

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,960
today

117
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,300
illusion the body the tapeworm has been

118
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,218
reduced to two primary functions simply

119
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,020
eating and reproducing

120
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:37,819
that's it they don't need any other

121
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:40,339
specialized features there's consuming

122
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,629
food and every producing I have a little

123
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,279
bit of how they look in the inside of

124
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:47,449
the body inside the intestine system

125
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:49,038
here and in the close-up now asada

126
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,419
flattens have an incomplete gut this

127
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,360
means flattens have a digestive cavity

128
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:55,788
they have an incomplete gut with only

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,250
one opening so hopefully you're not

130
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:59,628
eating during this video here but the

131
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,819
gut branches throughout the body so you

132
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:05,240
see here it's involved in both digestion

133
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:07,189
of food particles and also the excretion

134
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,139
of waste of the same area these

135
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,939
parasitic flatworms lessened entirely

136
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:15,139
and absorb food directly through their

137
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:17,360
body walls there's simple system they

138
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,949
lack circulatory system and all the

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,770
cells must be within diffusion distance

140
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:24,439
of oxygen in food this is why their flap

141
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:27,408
that great surface area to volume ratio

142
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,810
we have a very basic and simple nervous

143
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:31,519
system also free living forms have I

144
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,620
spots if you see here that can

145
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,598
distinguish light from dark so it's in

146
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,218
accurate to call these eyes they're just

147
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:42,199
ice spots because they're just sensing

148
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:44,509
light or dark lastly here gastrovascular

149
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,639
cavity is not a complete digestive

150
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:48,740
system so in the flatworm that has a

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,629
gastrovascular cavity with one opening

152
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,569
that serve as both a mouth and an anus

153
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:55,879
the excretory system is made up of these

154
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,650
tubes connected and every system is

155
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,088
composed of interconnected nerve cords

156
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,968
running the length of the body remember

157
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:04,278
it's very simple though and all to get

158
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:06,228
that food from the central gut region to

159
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:08,149
any of its cells they all have to be

160
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:10,389
within diffusion distance for that to

161
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:10,388
occur
