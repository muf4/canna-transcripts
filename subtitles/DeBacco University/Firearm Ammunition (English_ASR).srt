1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
okay here i'm going to go over different

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,919
types of firearm ammunition and while

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,599
these all may look very different

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,759
there are some similarities and some

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,039
consistencies and i'll go over those

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,439
specific terms

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,439
so you can be able to talk whatever part

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,079
of the ammunition you're talking about

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,039
you can be accurate so first off

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,599
ammunition

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,320
can be abbreviated ammo as the material

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,480
fired

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,679
scattered dropped or denoted from any

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,640
weapon you can see

15
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,759
a bunch of ammunition here as it is here

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,320
notice that there are some different

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,079
ones

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
these rounds here with the little red at

19
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,520
the very end those are called trace

20
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,479
arounds i'll go over those in another

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,800
video

22
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,640
the purpose of ammunition is to project

23
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,439
a force against a selected target

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,799
and have an effect usually not always

25
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,679
lethal so i don't think it's always

26
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,439
lethal

27
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,280
but a lot of times in this case with the

28
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,280
images projected here yes you're looking

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,039
at probably being lethal

30
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,879
the most iconic example of ammunition is

31
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
the firearm cartridge which includes all

32
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,359
the components required to deliver the

33
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,320
weapon

34
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,159
effectively in a single package so we

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,799
have a bullet we have a shell

36
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,679
casing so these are independent terms

37
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,118
and these are

38
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,920
different so a lot of times they get

39
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,959
mixed up the ones located here on the

40
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
screen these are all

41
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,919
bullets these are all the shell casings

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,118
so if you're going through a crime scene

43
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,400
and you find something like this and

44
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,719
people say they found

45
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
found bullets no technically you found

46
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,798
shell casings

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,560
the bullets would be located here so

48
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,118
again just be aware of the terms that

49
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
you're using

50
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,759
shell casings versus a bullet now the

51
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,319
cartridge here

52
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
in this image uh consists of a bullet

53
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,758
which would be number one

54
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
then the case which is located right

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,478
here and that holds all the parts

56
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,640
together

57
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,959
inside the case would be the propellant

58
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399
which is for example gunpowder

59
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,559
and then we have the rim which is the

60
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,519
very end portion here and that provides

61
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,519
the extractor

62
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,798
the firearm a place to grip the casing

63
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,359
and remove it once

64
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079
fired and at the very bottom kind of

65
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,078
center here

66
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,639
underneath here we would have the primer

67
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:04,078
which ignites the propellant

68
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,200
now the bullet specifically is

69
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,118
typically referred to as the end point

70
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,640
here so we're looking at a

71
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,318
bullet we're really looking at kind of

72
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,318
that end point

73
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,759
the actual bullet portion is limited

74
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,878
only to what we call

75
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,318
the projectile um so a lot of times we

76
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:20,799
call this the bullet that's inaccurate

77
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,839
this is

78
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,280
only only bullet remember it's that only

79
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,840
limited to that projectile portion

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,199
then we have the case so that holds

81
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
again all the parts of the cartridge

82
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,518
together

83
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
the cartridge without a projectile is

84
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,239
called a blank

85
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,280
now in the different types of cartridges

86
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,159
and kind of

87
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
can they're not always all together

88
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,519
there

89
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,318
are served different purposes so for

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
example

91
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,479
if we have a cartridge here that's

92
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,439
completely inert meaning it contains no

93
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,598
active primer

94
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,199
and also no propellant that's called a

95
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,039
dummy so that would be something

96
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,238
used just to kind of represent the same

97
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,239
size

98
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
but it contains no primer no propellant

99
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,920
it's just a dummy

100
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,920
when it's failed to ignite or shoot off

101
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,280
the projectile is called a dud

102
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,318
meaning there's something wrong with all

103
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
those components they didn't work

104
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,719
together it's a dud it didn't fire off

105
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
then when it ignited but failed to

106
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,000
sufficiently push the projectile out of

107
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
the barrel it's called a squib

108
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that could be for a variety of reasons

109
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
it could be a lack of propellant could

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,719
be

111
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,598
an inaccurate primer uh but these are

112
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,919
some terms

113
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,639
given if you had a crime scene you find

114
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,798
kind of

115
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,238
something that you know failed to ignite

116
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,120
or pull through the barrel if you find

117
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
it within the barrel

118
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,158
that could be called a squib just for

119
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
example

120
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,679
now the rims you mentioned that lower

121
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
portion down

122
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
down at the very base that provides the

123
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
extractor the firearm a place to grip

124
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,598
the casting and remove it from the

125
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,199
chamber

126
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,439
you can see different rims here with

127
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,318
different calibers but that they all

128
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,239
serve the same

129
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,839
purpose now center fire and rimfire so

130
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,000
these are two different types

131
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,360
we see center fire here and a rimfire

132
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
located right here

133
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
centrify cartridges as the name implies

134
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,080
is essentially located primer held

135
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,839
within the recess

136
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,319
of the case head often have about 6 65

137
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
000

138
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,399
psi max pressure the rimfire

139
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
priming is popular solution because

140
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
before

141
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,358
center fire priming was perfected so

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,879
they only have a maximum change of

143
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,959
chamber pressure about forty thousand

144
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,600
psi uh they don't have to be quite as

145
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
precise

146
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,439
uh they're a little less powerful a

147
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
little less punch but to get that center

148
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,800
fire really a lot

149
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,879
uh components had to come together so

150
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,680
before this was perfected the rimfire

151
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,360
rimfires are still used today but really

152
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
for the accuracy you can see definitely

153
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,639
that

154
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,319
center fire has that primer located

155
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,319
right in the center

156
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,839
that probably been talking about primer

157
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,519
when hit and the firearms

158
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,519
the hammer the primer will hit that it

159
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,959
will cause it to rapidly burn

160
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,399
that burning gas from the primer will

161
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,359
ignite the propellant so it's kind of

162
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,120
that first stage

163
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,960
and then the propellant goes this is an

164
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
explosion of ice propellant casting a

165
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,399
large explosion and that

166
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,720
large explosion will ultimately propel

167
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,719
the bullet down the chamber

168
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
and out the barrel that propellant

169
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
specifically

170
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
these propellant gases push the bullet

171
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,399
base

172
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,000
causing it to move the path of least

173
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,560
resistance which is down the

174
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,199
bore of the barrel modern propellants

175
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,439
are often

176
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
smokeless powders composed of

177
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,079
nitrocellulose

178
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,800
some contain nitrous cells some contain

179
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,680
nitroglycerin there's a whole bunch of

180
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
different types

181
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
but those are these the two major ones

182
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
they all fall into the same category of

183
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,120
propelling and that's what's actually

184
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
going to cause the force to force the

185
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
bullet out the bore

186
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,439
of the barrel they have different

187
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
calibers

188
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,038
so caliber is a specific nominal

189
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,599
integral

190
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,639
diameter of the gun barrel so the

191
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,879
diameter of

192
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
the barrels would think about caliber we

193
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,839
see a bunch listed or shown

194
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,478
here we have 22.22 caliber

195
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,159
all the way up to the 50 caliber here so

196
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,240
for example when we say

197
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,960
22 caliber the firearm has a barrel

198
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,360
diameter of roughly

199
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,239
0.22 inches if of the board you can see

200
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,879
it's a much

201
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
thinner or smaller diameter than the 50

202
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,159
cal

203
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,919
that is can be measured in kind of

204
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,880
inches or they can also be measured in

205
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,478
millimeters

206
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,478
very common one you may hear is nine

207
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,279
millimeter pistol so that's a barrel

208
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,639
as a barrel of nine millimeters and i

209
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,239
have a couple just shown here for

210
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,400
comparison

211
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,079
and last we have the shotgun shell so

212
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,918
shotgun shell

213
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,199
is a self-contained cartridge often

214
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,918
loaded with either

215
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,759
multiple metallic shot uh in this case

216
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,639
they're very small generally spherical

217
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,560
projectiles

218
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,079
or a single large slug and that can just

219
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,839
depend on one kind of

220
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,918
large slug one solid kind of piece of

221
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,519
metal or a bunch of little bbs

222
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,120
the shell consists of paper or plastic

223
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,000
tube mounted in the base and primer

224
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
holding that

225
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,600
and the shots typically contain a small

226
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
chamber inside the shell

227
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,280
casing and we could see that here

228
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,960
typically shotguns are used for

229
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,799
example bird hunting where you want to

230
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,478
have kind of a little bit of a spread

231
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
um to be able to hit the bird with some

232
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,839
of the pellets or it could be a slug if

233
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,879
you're kind of deer hunting

234
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,879
because you're kind of having that

235
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,199
target being very specific

236
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,918
so just some basics of firearm

237
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
ammunition
