00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
all right welcome to this debaco

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,040
university student series video we're

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,000
going to be taking a look at three week

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,039
old clones giving you an update as well

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
as a visual evaluation of their roots

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,119
i'm sure you can tell by the image

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,120
turned out quite well

8
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:23,278
[Music]

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,480
all right so before i get into the three

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,920
week clone update and visual evaluation

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
i just want to give you some background

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,239
information here very briefly first off

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,839
there was a light change went from a

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,320
fluent spider plus 660 watt led to the

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
agrobrite designer t5s

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,039
running at 260 watts and those are

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,520
fluorescents and we see both of those in

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,600
the image right here and links down

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079
below for more information on both of

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,000
those lights in addition just kind of a

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,679
clone age comparison did have some

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
difference in age these are the three

23
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,280
week old clones here on the left that

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,238
you can see in the cloner and kind of

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,399
the zoomed in images here and then week

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,319
and a half old clones here on the right

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,400
just so you can see the difference

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,239
between that week and a half to three

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,359
week old clone

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,199
and then lastly the water conditions so

31
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,359
they were basically left untouched for

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,600
about the three weeks there

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,920
only the ph really needed some slight

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
adjustment after some more water was

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
added because you want to make sure

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,118
you're keeping that at the

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,879
proper height for the cloner so now

38
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,959
let's get into the video

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,438
so this is an update since the last time

40
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,438
we've came and seen our clones pretty

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,000
much since the last time we switched out

42
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,478
our lights from the fluence

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,719
led lights to some fluorescent lights

44
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,719
from agrobrite

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,559
i'm going to be taking a live comparison

46
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,399
of our led versus fluorescent lights to

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,478
show you why we opted to use our

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,680
fluorescent lights for our clones rather

49
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:01,280
than the more intensive led lights

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,000
so at plant level here i'm reading at

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,000
240 now remember we have two of our

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,399
lights off up here so only four of our

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,560
lights are going but 200 is a perfect

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,000
level for clones of this size

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,680
versus

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,039
at the same plant level

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
an 800 par meter rating over on this

58
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,799
side with our led lights now there is no

59
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,958
reason to really have this much light

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
penetrating our baby clones here so it

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,878
would make much more sense to opt for

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,879
the 200 par reading as opposed to 800.

63
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,039
we also took some more clones from

64
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,878
outdoors these were taken about a week

65
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,840
and a half ago in comparison to the

66
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,239
original ones we took three weeks ago

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,319
looking at our monitor for our

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,360
conductivity and ph we're seeing that

69
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,598
our conductivity is at 710 which is a

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,040
little high but it's good enough

71
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,679
our ph is at 7.1 which is a little more

72
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,318
basic than how we would like it to be so

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,480
we could add some of our ph down to make

74
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:02,079
it more acidic and maybe bring it down

75
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,079
to a good 6.6

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,759
now we're going to check our clones to

77
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,759
see how well they're rooting

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,439
as you can see this side is a lot more

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
developed than this side and this is

80
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,840
because these have been developing for

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,840
about a week and a half more than these

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,840
have
