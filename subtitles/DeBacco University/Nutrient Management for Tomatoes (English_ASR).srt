1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,609
here we look at managing nutrients for

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,550
tomatoes and helispot particular

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:11,309
deficiencies so starting with calcium

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,469
what to look for a calcium deficiency a

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:15,419
rot spot that starts at the blossom end

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,519
of the tomato this is more common in

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,339
longer Tomatoes simply because the

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,618
calcium has longer to travel typically

9
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,170
runs out before it gets to the very end

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,730
how to prevent this will soil testing to

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,189
know if you're naturally low in calcium

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,050
and also make applications just before

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,689
fruit set of a calcium product if

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,759
there's known to be an issue of a paste

15
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:38,939
tomato choses blossom end rot that

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,479
you're seeing here in here may be

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:44,519
advantageous to start a calcium regimen

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,049
for your other varieties because there's

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,210
a longer Tomatoes they typically will

20
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,308
show it first and it can be a senator

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,679
others may be getting exposed to this so

22
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,049
treat as soon as you see it starting to

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,509
develop to prevent it from getting on to

24
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,929
the other crops they're how to control

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,030
well

26
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,090
cal-mag plus from botanic air or a

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,728
Bioman calcium if you're under organic

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,109
restrictions magnesium deficiency well

29
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:08,789
the lower leaves will start develop a

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,920
mottled look to them and progress to

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,110
brown lesions this is kind of how they

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,329
look I can see the brown lesions

33
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,489
starting to develop here monitor plants

34
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,099
and make applications if problems are

35
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:23,250
noticed before fruit set typically the

36
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,959
application would be any epsom salts

37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,659
starting about a rate of about one

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,699
tablespoon per gallon this is in part

39
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,340
why cal-mag is advised because you get

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,810
both calcium and magnesium so you're not

41
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,700
getting blossom end rot and hopefully

42
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,180
not getting too much of this lower leaf

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,740
yellowing there's also potassium this is

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,930
browning of the leaf margins which is

45
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,949
the edges of the leaves here on the

46
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,920
other shoulders can be another

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,129
indication but so can some skulls so be

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,359
careful on your Sun scald areas how to

49
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:52,920
prevent you want to add a potassium

50
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,810
product with your irrigation water

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,460
especially if you're getting heavily

52
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,710
during the plant growth phase of

53
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,509
development as a result you have pushed

54
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,509
out or flushed out some of that natural

55
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,489
potassium does in your soil

56
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,500
sulfate potassium applications are

57
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,598
recommending a kelp can also add

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,180
potassium it's often not in quantities

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,609
needed especially during a heavy fruit

60
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,290
set of a plan

61
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,910
the nitrogen what to look for on our

62
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,280
nature and efficient which is not always

63
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,229
the case maybe early in the season I'll

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,509
be yelling branches and typically the

65
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,310
lower branches when a feed nitrogen

66
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:27,989
fertilizer especially early when the

67
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,420
salt on the cool side they may not be

68
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,460
greatly plant-available all the

69
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,889
nutrients in this is the easiest one to

70
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,599
fix so of all the things to be low in

71
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,429
choose to be low in nitrogen it's a

72
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,759
quick and easy fix if you apply nitrogen

73
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,250
fertilizer to a plant and ji6 best is

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,829
low in nitrogen wait about three days or

75
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,389
so if you water it in immediately and it

76
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,280
doesn't change in three to four days if

77
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,439
not nitrogen that's the problem it's

78
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,610
something else last thing we talked

79
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,650
about deficiency they want type of

80
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,810
excessive nutrients so over feeding of

81
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,300
one nutrient can block other nutrients

82
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,759
this is most common with nitrogen

83
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,870
doesn't benefit the plant it can cause a

84
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,810
reduction in yield

85
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:11,219
Griese is very healthy put in quotes

86
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,710
looking plants that look just huge but

87
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:15,270
they don't really produce much in the

88
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,980
way of fruit you're shifting that plant

89
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,810
to grow more leaves than actually set

90
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,340
fruit it could also mean you over

91
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,439
fertilize potentially contaminate ground

92
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,569
water and you're also wasting time and

93
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,300
money so apply fertilizers at

94
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,340
recommended rates and with a soil test

95
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,480
to know if you should be adding that

96
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,479
nutrient in the first place
