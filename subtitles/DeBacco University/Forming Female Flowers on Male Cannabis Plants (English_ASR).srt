00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,719
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,798
we're going to be looking at forming

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,919
female flowers on male

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,199
cannabis plants so how is this possible

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,679
i'm going to take you through some of

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,320
the steps i'll point you to our research

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,759
paper

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,600
and this can be very important for the

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,519
breeding process

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,439
so first off the research article here

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,640
you can research it on here this is a

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,879
copy of that

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
original research you can find some more

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,198
details here i want to provide a summary

15
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,198
here

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,118
for you but this is the source and where

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
some of the images and information were

18
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,280
gathered

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,880
so first off looking at self-fertilizing

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,879
so while self-fertilizing a plant can

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,879
help retain certain genetic traits

22
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,159
this can be quite a challenge with

23
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,679
dioecious plants

24
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,000
such as cannabis that produces

25
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,159
distinctive male and distinctive

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
female plants since each plant only

27
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,279
produces one type of flower this creates

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920
an inherent problem

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,280
with self-fertilizing a lot easier with

30
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
some other plants

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,879
some growers may just decide to clone

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
the plant but if this does not allow for

33
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,759
the production of seeds which may be

34
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,000
desired

35
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,359
so we have to find a way to kind of be

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,239
able to self-fertilize

37
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,599
and this research does allow this as an

38
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,679
option

39
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,798
so first off we determine the male plant

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
primordia

41
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
so what does that kind of mean what's

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,879
that referring to and that's kind of

43
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,920
like the early

44
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,599
flower indication so that primordia

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
determine that section that's early

46
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,039
flower development and when that

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
initial formation does occur male

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
promoter can be identified by their

49
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,600
curved claw

50
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
shaped which was followed by the

51
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,919
deformation of round pointed

52
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,719
flower buds at the time of primordial

53
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
formation

54
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,640
the primordial were formed between the

55
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,118
stipule and the pale under the chute

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,118
tip as far as where to look as time goes

57
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,519
on leaves become smaller

58
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,118
decreased and more flowers were formed

59
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,560
so it's important note to make

60
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,040
this kind of gives you some visual

61
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
indication here of the female

62
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
and male plants kind of how they look at

63
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
that very early stage very similar and

64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,118
how they become

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
differentiated now the plant treatments

66
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,718
here

67
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,560
in this trial for 7 to 14 days

68
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,399
after the primary formation the male

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,159
plants were treated with 500

70
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,598
milligrams per liter of ethron

71
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,520
to induce female flower formation

72
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,039
dilution rates are provided at the end

73
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
and how you go about

74
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,239
calculating those uh so just important

75
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,318
consideration there

76
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,520
male plants at the time of ephron

77
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,399
treatment so

78
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
here in figure a male plants at the time

79
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,519
of the ethanol treatment after male

80
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,519
primordial formation

81
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,159
we kind of can see that located right

82
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,039
down here at that stage of development

83
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,159
image b shows that seven days later what

84
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,400
the progression is

85
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,840
and then we see 14 days later again the

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,760
leaf and the male flowers

87
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
becoming much more distinctive two weeks

88
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,679
after

89
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,519
now female flowers on male plants you

90
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,920
know how does this go about what kind of

91
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
negatives do we see here well female

92
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,280
flowers and male plants have five

93
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,599
stigmas in contrast to the dual stigma

94
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,519
of

95
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,598
female plants that's an important note

96
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,439
there male planted

97
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,359
seeds were lighter and smaller than

98
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,959
those from female plants

99
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
we see that here here's the male plant

100
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,280
seeds there's those from the

101
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,239
corresponding female plants they are

102
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
smaller

103
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,000
and they are in lighter in coloration

104
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,958
and although germinates are

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,400
lower in these smaller seeds compared to

106
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,759
normal seeds from female plants as that

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
source of comparison

108
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,798
the seeds from the male germinated did

109
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,318
still germinate and grow into seedlings

110
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
so even though the percentage of

111
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,000
germination might be less

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,919
they still can produce plants and that's

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,959
very important again for that breeding

114
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,958
process

115
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,719
and here we see female flowers on a

116
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,479
female plant that's the normal to kind

117
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,560
of expect or control

118
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,598
here we see the male and female flowers

119
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,158
induced by the

120
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,839
etharon treatment on the male plants and

121
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,519
last we see male flowers at a male plant

122
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,039
which would be normal or control

123
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
so again this would be a normal female

124
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,639
plant a normal male plant

125
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,798
and then here we see the treatment and

126
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,158
how we get that slight you know

127
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,280
difference between the two because we're

128
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,079
inducing those female flowers to form

129
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,919
on a male plant now there's fm

130
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,080
treatments to conclusions here

131
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,039
well we're looking at the treatment to

132
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,120
male plant set

133
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,959
soon after the primordial formation will

134
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,759
be a good strategy and breeding program

135
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,719
to breed

136
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,639
inbred lines of hemp by self-fertilizing

137
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,439
it allows that plant to then produce

138
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,600
pollen

139
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,680
that otherwise we would need a separate

140
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,240
plant for so it's allowing that kind of

141
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,959
closed

142
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,720
loop within the genetic lines so a lot

143
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,319
of growers will hunt the whole okay

144
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,600
how do i go about calculating how to go

145
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,759
about treating this well here i'm going

146
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,919
to describe the process

147
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,439
so here we're calculating that 500

148
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,918
milligrams per liter

149
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,199
of the ethron here part one i'm going to

150
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,439
take you through a couple parts this is

151
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,919
an example product here

152
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,800
so note that the goal is 500 milligrams

153
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,959
per liter

154
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,680
which is a 0.05 percent solution

155
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,239
in this example here this product listed

156
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,400
is

157
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,000
21.7 percent um ethron

158
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,799
it's the same as saying uh 217

159
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,478
000 milligrams per liter so you want to

160
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
use this equation if you've done any

161
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,000
science particularly chemistry

162
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,038
you might be familiar with this equation

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,560
c1

164
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,800
v1 equals c2 v2 the c1 is the

165
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,038
concentration of the stock solution

166
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,038
v1 is the volume to be removed or

167
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,918
l-quaded out from the concentrated stock

168
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,839
solution

169
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,198
c2 is the final concentration of the

170
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,359
diluted solution

171
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,720
and v2 is the final volume of the

172
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,919
diluted solution

173
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,759
this is the volume that results after

174
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,279
v1 from the stock solution has been

175
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,038
diluted with

176
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,879
whatever you're diluting it with here

177
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,719
it's water to achieve the total diluted

178
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,959
volume of v2

179
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
an alternate and commonly used notation

180
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,439
for this equation is

181
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,478
m1 v1 equals m2 v2 where m is used in

182
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,600
place of c

183
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,839
so you might be familiar with it

184
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
presented that way let's run through an

185
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,319
example

186
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
so keep in mind that goal still is the

187
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,360
same 500 milligrams per liter because

188
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,799
that is what was used in the study

189
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,800
we have the same starting material here

190
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,478
that's 21.7 percent

191
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
so here i went through and show you the

192
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,038
calculations i'm using the c1 v1

193
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,600
equals c2 v2 and this would be c1 times

194
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,839
v1 equals c2 times v2

195
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,199
fill in our knowns we're creating a 500

196
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,359
milligram per liter

197
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,199
solution and we're just for the purposes

198
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,919
here i said we're going to make a total

199
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
liter one liter and we have the

200
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,439
concentration here of our product is

201
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
21.7 percent

202
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,439
and that would equal 217 000 milligrams

203
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
per liter

204
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,800
we simply go through we multiply these

205
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,519
two numbers here

206
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
uh we go through we uh would then divide

207
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:39,519
by here

208
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:41,600
and we get v1 would equal 0.002304

209
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,359
liters that would be the kind of

210
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
concentration or volume i should say

211
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,160
that we're using

212
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
of this particular concentration of

213
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
solution

214
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,879
so how does that look and taking it the

215
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,680
next step the final step here the part

216
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,079
three

217
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
note that that liter amount is the same

218
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,120
as

219
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
using our conversion factors two point

220
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
three zero four

221
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,759
milliliters take l and divide it by a

222
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,598
thousand milliliters take the liters

223
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,160
divided by a thousand get milliliters

224
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,120
so you want alcohol exactly 2.304

225
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,439
milliliters

226
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,598
of the stock solution and dilute it with

227
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,918
water so there's a final volume

228
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,240
of one liter typically what you'll do is

229
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,079
you're i'll quote that 2.304 milliliters

230
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
and then fill it up to a one

231
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,240
liter mark this will yield a one liter

232
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,359
of dilute solution with a final solute

233
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
concentration

234
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,598
of 500 milligrams per liter note the

235
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
following returns to the total solution

236
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,639
volume which is the combination volume

237
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,079
of the stock solution

238
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,759
and the volume of the water used for

239
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,918
dilution that's why typically you might

240
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,439
add some water and the 2.3 and fill it

241
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,680
up to exactly one liter

242
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,199
because that's your final solution there

243
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
see if you want to try this out yourself

244
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
this is an example

245
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
product here if you find another product

246
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,918
as a different percentage

247
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,280
you can simply follow these same steps

248
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,598
with a different percentage

249
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,799
and calculate the exact amount that you

250
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,598
need to aliquot

251
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,720
to create your one liter solution of

252
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,120
that would be still

253
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,479
500 milligrams per liter hopefully this

254
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
was helpful gives you a little bit of a

255
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,560
scientific background here

256
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
when we're looking at breeding cannabis

257
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
plants
