1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
okay there's gonna be a quick overview

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,878
of cover crops which are simply living

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,129
carpets it's an example of a cover crop

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,460
it's a crop that's grown to cover and

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,900
protect the soil so what does some of

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,120
the pros and cons to cover crop so the

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,010
pros is you get soil stabilization soil

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,739
rotation get different root structures

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,359
in there new treatment holding you can

10
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,858
attract beneficial and insects

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,099
particularly buckwheat's good at doin

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,050
this and the cons I really don't know if

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,910
any if you find out anything let me know

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,140
some growers may complain there might be

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,600
a little hard to deal with depending

16
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,989
what your groom other than that there's

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,058
a lot of benefits to these that I don't

18
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:41,128
really know too many negatives the

19
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,780
selection process is important and in

20
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,159
part it's season dependent and then when

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,929
you want to grow the cover crop easier

22
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,058
over the winter or during the summer if

23
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,769
you're resting in the area winter in New

24
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,439
England is most limiting because of our

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,680
simple lack of warm temperatures to grow

26
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:58,500
any sort of crop blends get a lot of

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,269
attention I say I want to do a blend in

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,820
there as well how many do you want in

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,629
there on there's basically three

30
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,500
classifications despite all the

31
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,048
different species

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,540
there's grasses there's legumes which

33
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,240
you shouldn't aq8 in some way and the

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,380
brassicas provided a link here you can

35
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,228
click on this screen and in the

36
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,938
description you'll find a link to the

37
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:20,039
lecture slides and also the sources for

38
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,489
all the images I welcome to click on

39
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,080
here it's produced by NRCS and they do a

40
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,539
pretty good job of summarizing some of

41
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,728
the cover crops but to give you just a

42
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,299
quick idea on New England standards for

43
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,938
the wintertime

44
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,680
winterreise name implies it can

45
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,719
germinate basically any temperature

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,829
above 32 degrees Fahrenheit any

47
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,019
temperature below freezing it can

48
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:42,059
germinate it'll be slow but it can

49
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,750
germinate hairy vetch is another option

50
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,269
the one here

51
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,009
it's great at fixing nitrogen but it

52
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,658
fixes most of its nitrogen just before

53
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,549
flowering late in the growth cycle when

54
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,079
we see the purple flowers that's the

55
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,240
sign it's fixing as much nitrogen as

56
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,559
possible and you want to go through kill

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,809
it other why it becomes like rope and

58
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,490
can wrap around your equipment so it is

59
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,019
a vine it can be an issue but if you

60
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:01,559
kill the right time there should be no

61
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,769
problems

62
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,269
winter I can get very tall and confirm

63
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,758
rates at very low temperatures typically

64
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,739
seed in the late fall on both of these

65
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,829
will our winter hardy will survive harsh

66
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,810
New England winters in the summer

67
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,030
never looking at resting an area we have

68
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,039
issues we can't get into a field and

69
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,840
want to rest that for the summer we have

70
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,419
buckwheat or Sudan grass to be two great

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,789
options both week was really quick but

72
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,289
be careful can reseed itself when you

73
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:30,359
see the white flowers here this is again

74
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,250
a sign you want to come through and kill

75
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,050
it some why does attract beneficial

76
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,300
insects you're kind of playing the line

77
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,880
there how long do you keep it up to keep

78
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,010
the insects in the area or risk the

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,870
chance of it receding now it has receded

80
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,549
at least in the situations that I have

81
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,210
seen it hasn't been really that

82
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,830
aggressive so it's not a major concern

83
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,290
Sudan grass grows very tall you need a

84
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,940
special equipment to manage it properly

85
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,519
think of this is like corn without the

86
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:00,300
ear hears it looks like here looks like

87
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,310
corn they can get really tall six feet

88
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,050
even taller and it can get really thick

89
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,449
and be difficult to deal with if you

90
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,160
don't have specialized equipment kind of

91
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,739
be able to get in there or I get down

92
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,759
beat it up pretty good mow it down you

93
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,459
wanted to make sure you have something

94
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,340
or plan for to have something if you do

95
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,349
plan on growing that other's red clover

96
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,430
tillage radish red clover is great

97
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:24,629
really low don't fix nitrogen tillage

98
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,569
radish getting a lot of attention to

99
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,250
kind of break up heavy compacted soil if

100
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,979
you do use tillage radish should be

101
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,419
careful don't over seat it with too much

102
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,488
other than the recommendation says

103
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:39,059
because when these do go to rot they can

104
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,430
produce quite the odor so being mindful

105
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,469
of your neighbors in that case keep the

106
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,189
plantings it is a pretty small planting

107
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,319
per acre

108
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:47,969
as far as seeds go keep it low don't

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,409
over add because they will they can

110
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,289
produce quite theater again when they do

111
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:56,250
go to rot after they perform their job

112
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:57,659
you're busting into thick soil should

113
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,050
you fertilize your cover crop the simple

114
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,539
answer

115
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,090
no I gave no and a bunch of different

116
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,039
languages here in fact if your cover

117
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,080
crop does not look a little deficient

118
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,509
odds are you may have over fertilize in

119
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,870
season anyway so your cover crop does

120
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:15,298
not necessary dark green that's a sign

121
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,608
you may have over added nutrients in

122
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,858
season but should you actually fertilize

123
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,189
it no let it grow it can actually show

124
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:26,849
you where some good or poor errors might

125
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,269
be in your field lastly consider cover

126
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,120
crops

127
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:31,318
in season two under seed under senior

128
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,750
cash crop at the same time

129
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,930
yeah clover this is a grass mix under

130
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:40,050
some corn here so it is possible to

131
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,000
actually have a living carpet under your

132
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,250
potential cash crop again depending what

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,959
it is clover confused in walkways or

134
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,259
lower growing crops your grass could be

135
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,029
used for kind of another grass corn just

136
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,830
a way to help stabilize soil and reduce

137
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,829
weed pressure again in certain cases
