00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,000
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
where i'm going to go over key plant

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240
hormones and give you kind of a quick

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:17,440
general summary of many of the hormones

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:19,359
that impact plants

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,480
all right let's get into those key plant

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,760
hormones here

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,278
so first off i want you to understand

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
that there's many plant hormones there's

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,559
not just

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,920
one there's not just two and even within

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,239
the couple categories

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
there's multiple that may fall under

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,199
that same category

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,558
so there's many different plant hormones

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
some of the main categories of plant

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:36,879
hormones will be covered and provide you

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,320
a general overview

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
but i just want you to realize that just

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,238
under gibberellins and that's this one

21
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,078
plant hormone typically abbreviated gas

22
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,878
there's over 120

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,558
identified somewhat different um kind of

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,159
effects on the plants here and

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,799
they're at least kind of commonly named

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,439
with ga1 j2 j3 so on and so forth so

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,159
realize

28
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,839
that within gibberellins there is 120

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,279
just under that one and they can have

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,440
everything from enhancing calcium

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,000
phosphorus potassium

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,679
content to promoting seed germination to

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,118
stimulating stem and root growth so a

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
lot of different studies with a lot of

35
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,560
different hormones

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,640
now also the interaction with all these

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,240
hormones that can get very confusing

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,400
so tried by a little couple summary

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,438
charts here where we can see some have

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,159
inhibitory effects on others some

41
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,399
block others some also kind of promote

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
others or work synergistically together

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,920
we kind of get all these crazy kind of

44
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,118
interactions that may occur so this can

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,478
get confusing

46
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,400
not going to spend a ton of time on all

47
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,478
the complexities once you've realized

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,960
that there is a lot at play here

49
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,799
we're going to focus on just the basics

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,199
so typically also when we have

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,720
our hormones a series of steps and

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
pathways are involved

53
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,640
so here we see with trichantinol what

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
does it cause what can cause greater

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,079
dry weight and growth wonderful how does

56
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:51,919
it

57
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,679
kind of accomplish that well we could

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,879
see there's secondary messengers there's

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,960
enzymes involved there's

60
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,118
metabolism changes in effect there's

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,239
this kind of cascading effect that while

62
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,799
we have one thing

63
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,078
that creates one result it goes about it

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
in many different

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,478
pathways and it impacts many different

66
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,758
aspects of the plant so what are some of

67
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
these kind of plant hormones you know

68
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,119
what's a general summary

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
these are the key ones there's auxins

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
gibberellins cytokines abscisic acid and

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
ethylene

72
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
this would be a great kind of slide to

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
pause and kind of go through some of

74
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
these

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
however each of these are covered on

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
separate videos

77
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,560
here on debaco university so good to

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
kind of

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,159
type that name in the search within the

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,439
channel find some of these so you can

81
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,359
learn a little bit more

82
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,359
about what the main highlight is for

83
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
each of these five main hormones

84
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
however there's also more hormones that

85
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,199
will be covered

86
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,159
and we can see a couple listed here and

87
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,919
these are kind of like

88
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,000
also you know plant hormones but a

89
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,919
little less known a little kind of those

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,878
secondary uh plant hormones and you can

91
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,399
see their effects

92
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,318
can be very important and everything you

93
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,280
know promote the primary

94
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
root growth leaf senescence so they are

95
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
definitely important

96
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,238
in pathways of the plant but maybe a

97
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,359
little less understood a little less

98
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,280
kind of commonly

99
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
covered but all covered here

100
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,878
specifically with their own video

101
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,480
that you're welcome to check out here on

102
