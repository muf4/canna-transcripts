00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:06,380
in this tobacco University video we're

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,379
going to go over cannabis edibles

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,059
[Music]

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,640
let's get into some understanding of

5
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:19,439
just what cannabis Edibles actually are

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,500
so some of the products mentioned here

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,000
are derived from CT Pharma and the

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,439
reason why they were chosen is they

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,679
offer a lot of publicly available

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,079
analytical reports that they produce and

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,640
you can go through and access those also

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,320
in this video the descriptions opinions

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,460
and uses are intended to provide an

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,700
understanding of some of the end

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,899
products of the cannabis plant and those

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,399
analytical reports will be provided at

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,840
the end and they're often a missed

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,939
component that should accompany any

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,079
product someone is interested in

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,939
purchasing

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,939
so let's get into the description of

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,920
Edibles well they are either ready to be

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,679
eaten or ready to be infused food items

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,300
with marijuana or a cannabis plant in

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,579
result they have multiple different

26
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,979
dosage and a multitude of different food

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,480
variations and because of this it is

28
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,399
kind of a word of caution if you're

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,019
going to be looking at Edibles to make

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,200
sure you definitely have them distinctly

31
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,699
isolated and kept only for adult use you

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,680
don't want these to fall into the hands

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,880
of children it can be very easy for that

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,799
to occur

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,959
so the options of Edibles we could see

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,118
very common products honey infused

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,459
baking mix drink mix olive oil

38
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,978
different doses associated with these

39
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,239
strings usually low to medium for the

40
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,560
most part and again if you've watched

41
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,118
other videos you see some have high

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,859
strength some have medium strength these

43
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,840
tend to be low to medium but keep in

44
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,519
mind that we do want to be protective of

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,799
these items labeling them sectioning

46
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,478
them similar different making sure that

47
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,820
kids don't come in contact with these

48
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,459
particular edible options

49
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,379
now the use of Edibles it can be

50
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,359
consumed orally for strong medical

51
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,759
effects it will set in about 45 minutes

52
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,560
to an hour after consumption that's an

53
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,079
important note to make that's not an

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
immediate effect there is a delay so you

55
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,319
don't want to be mindful of the dosage

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,000
that you're incurring you want to be

57
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,319
taking one dose and then immediately 10

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
minutes later taking another and another

59
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,639
because there is that delayed effect

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,039
infused olive oil and Bake Mix can be

61
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,159
added directly to any any sort of baking

62
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:14,458
recipe or cooking a choice to properly

63
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,780
Infuse with active in this case THC but

64
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,219
again you want to be mindful keeping

65
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,318
them away from children

66
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,939
so as I mentioned at the beginning those

67
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,159
importance of the certificate of

68
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,598
analysis and yes many people will

69
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,639
probably be looking at the cannabinoid

70
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,919
profiles or the terpenes and that's well

71
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,799
and good but we want to be mindful also

72
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:34,259
of looking at some of the other things

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,180
such as microbiology microtoxins heavy

74
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,699
metal and pesticides making sure we're

75
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,519
passing all of those you can also see

76
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,378
here the detection levels for different

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,480
pesticides making sure we're passing all

78
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,518
of those as well a lot of times these

79
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,679
numbers will come present on the label

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,539
which is a great thing as we can see on

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,219
all of these labels but it's also your

82
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,840
right as a consumer to make sure the lot

83
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,359
numbers are matching up to those

84
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,560
original analytical reports so that your

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
informed consumer
