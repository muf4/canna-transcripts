1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,120
in this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,160
covering

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,600
thc and thca cannabinoids to provide you

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
with a little bit more detail

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,279
on these so you can develop a better

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,279
appreciation for this particular

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,320
cannabinoid

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,199
[Music]

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
so you might be wondering what the

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
difference between thc and thc a is well

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,118
here we see them

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,399
in the basic chemical structure and thc

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,518
a basically has this

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,320
additional group added on here so again

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,119
that's the

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
chemical difference at the molecular

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,519
level so this is a great research

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,039
article here

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,040
where we're looking at it goes into a

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,119
lot of detail on many cannabinoids

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,640
this video lecture i'm going to focus on

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,679
thc

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,359
so t ythc well it's the famous one

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,719
it is one of the most recognized

25
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,719
cannabinoids ever to be

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,320
discovered kind of like the taj mahal

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,198
show a picture everyone knows what that

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,439
is

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,399
while there are multiple compounds in

30
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,039
cannabis that offer

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,640
medicinal benefits and many more that

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,879
modulate the impact of thc

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
there are none with such psychoactive

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,359
impact as

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
thc and that's why it's kind of the most

36
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,959
famous one because it has such

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,118
a unique effect so what does that affect

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,000
well kind of the effect with rthc

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,879
after consuming decarboxylated thca or

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,478
thc

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,399
in high doses can cause near

42
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,920
halluciations for some

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
although the effect is not technically

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,320
intoxicating it is certainly

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,439
abbreviating and of very often

46
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,679
psychedelic

47
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,438
so some effects of acute marijuana

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
intoxication we could see some of the

49
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,639
after effects

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
of consuming a cannabis bud here that

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,799
has a high amount of thc

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,679
now here it says consuming decarboxylate

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,640
thca when it's decarboxylated it goes to

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,759
the delta 9 t2 many people are familiar

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,879
with

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,239
so the molecule that started the war it

57
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,959
is the cannabinoid

58
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,359
that is the target of now fading drug

59
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,359
war

60
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,040
which characterized canvas as a

61
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,599
dangerous and addictive

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,880
drug in the absence of thca there may

63
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,280
never have been a

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,879
drug war against cannabis so it's just

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
kind of an interesting

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,919
component of that it was really the

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
molecule that the plant produced that

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,439
really caused a lot of this

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
drug war kind of developing companies

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,400
such as the farmer and the felon

71
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,080
things like that dea going after plants

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
and the federal level being set at what

73
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,879
it is for the specific thc molecule

74
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,719
so what's the original source well tc

75
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,919
believe it or not the original source is

76
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,239
cbga

77
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,919
thca likes cbda as synthesized from cbga

78
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,599
in the apple plastic space of the

79
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,679
secretory vesicle within

80
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,799
the trichome structure the enzyme that

81
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
does the work is

82
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,080
thcaas or thca synthase

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,280
again there is a peroxide byproduct

84
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
which is toxic to the cell therefore

85
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,199
thcas

86
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:54,079
or thca synthase biosynthesis must occur

87
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,199
in the trichome of the secretory vesicle

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,120
so we're looking kind of a visual of

89
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,479
this well here's our cbga

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
and then it's thca and also cbg is being

91
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,199
derived

92
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,119
from that single molecule kind of like

93
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,759
the original molecule the stem cell

94
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,439
molecule

95
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,959
that through enzymatic actions and other

96
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,199
plant functions can then

97
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,000
be made to produce these various

98
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,598
compounds

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,598
all occurring within the trichome so thc

100
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,759
and regulations when we're looking at

101
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,919
current regulations that require all cbd

102
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,359
hemp flowers with a thc content greater

103
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,518
than 0.3 percent

104
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
thereby classified as marijuana and must

105
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,158
be destroyed

106
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,639
there are a few exceptions to the rule

107
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,840
of thcaase producing thca

108
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,759
and cbdas producing cbda

109
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
so a couple exceptions but pretty much

110
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,318
all cannabis hemp

111
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,039
uh equal to or less than 0.3 percent thc

112
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,759
marijuana greater than 0.3 percent

113
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,759
thc tht being that molecule that causes

114
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,318
the category the categorization

115
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,919
of that plant material so we get into

116
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,839
biological expectations versus

117
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,359
regulations well research from oregon

118
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,479
cbd company has shown

119
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,680
that in vitro cbdas will produce

120
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,560
one part thca for every 20 parts of

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
cbda why is that important well because

122
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
with the cannabinoid content of hemp

123
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,000
exceeding 20 percent

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,319
it may be totally unreasonable to have

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the thca content requirement

126
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,839
set to 0.3 or less simply because we can

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,120
biologically expect a minimum

128
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:25,039
of one percent thca for every 20

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,600
of cbda produced by the cbda synthase

130
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
the required synthase for cbda

131
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,919
production

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
so because of this this means that if

133
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,279
we're getting these cannabis so high

134
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,080
the plant has to convert a certain

135
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,239
percentage so for exceeding 20 percent

136
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,319
cannabinoids in hemp we are expected

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,120
biologically biological expectations to

138
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,599
get

139
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
a minimum of one percent thca so

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
therefore setting the

141
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,000
federal limit at 0.3 percent or less

142
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,439
really limits the amount of cannabinoids

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that this plant can theoretically

144
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,800
produce

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,040
overall so again that regulations versus

146
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,840
the biological expectations of the plant

147
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
again don't really match up so the

148
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,119
interactions

149
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
we're looking specifically at thc um in

150
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,000
its interactions

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,000
and in the human receptors particularly

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,120
interacts with the cb

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
1 receptor in the endocannabinoid system

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,478
for the majority of these receptors are

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,478
found in the nervous system tissues

156
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,399
and when bound by thc they modulate the

157
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,279
electrochemical systems that allow us to

158
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,198
perceive the world

159
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,959
presumably resulting in that

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
psychoactive effect

161
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,399
and here's just a little comparison here

162
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,799
and some studies have been done on thc

163
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,478
found in that article so lastly just

164
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,879
want to leave you with a thc

165
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,599
thc comparison to aspirin this is also

166
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,879
explains the

167
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,680
logistic muscle relaxant

168
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,560
and antiplasmic properties thc has been

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
shown to have

170
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,478
20 20 times the anti-inflammatory power

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,520
of aspirin

172
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,519
