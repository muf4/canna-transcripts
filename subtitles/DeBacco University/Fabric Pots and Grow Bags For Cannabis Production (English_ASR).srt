1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,359
so in this debaco university video we'll

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,599
be covering

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,410
fabric pots and grow bags for cannabis

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:14,879
production

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:16,000
[Music]

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
all right let's start looking at some of

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,719
these fabric pots and grow bags for

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,079
cannabis production so first off the

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,919
advantage of using

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,919
a fabric pot is that it allows for

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,160
aeration to the root zone

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
they come in small to potentially very

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
large sizes up to 400 gallon size

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,280
they're very user friendly the material

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800
allows for natural root pruning to avoid

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,558
kind of that circling effect that you

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,119
might get with a solid

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,759
container and then they also allow water

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,519
to drain

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,599
very easily all these are great

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
advantages and part of the reason why

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
they've become so popular

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
the material that they're made of might

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,079
vary slightly from company to company

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,600
but here i provided a little example

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,239
here what's called gorillapods they're

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
pretty

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,519
commonly used they are used basically a

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,520
breathable fabric that helps support

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
while still allowing movement to the

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
root system they're typically made from

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,280
mostly polypropylene fiber with an

33
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,359
anti-uv

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,118
application to reduce degradation

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,040
especially in outdoor settings

36
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,400
because fabric pots are not only used

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
just in indoor settings

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
they can be used also in outdoor

39
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,199
settings there's a lot more

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,118
environmental stresses so you want to

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
make sure if you are going in an outdoor

42
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,719
situation that you are finding a pot

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,200
that might be a little extra for

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,239
but definitely has the advantages of

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,359
those anti-uv applications made

46
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,280
now fabric pack you'll notice that they

47
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,799
come in a variety of colors

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
and while there are a variety of color

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
options tan simply has gained popularity

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,000
especially in

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
outdoor settings because it can keep the

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
root zone cool

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
in the heat of summer something that's

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
going to not necessarily absorb a lot of

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,520
heat

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
we saw the white one earlier but won't

57
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,478
show the a dirt from moving it around

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,960
quite a bit

59
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,319
so again there's a variety of colors the

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,798
really advantage particularly for the

61
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,319
outdoor

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
network do you want that anti-uv

63
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,599
stabilizer but you want something that's

64
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,639
going to keep that root zone

65
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,759
relatively cool now fire pots and water

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,118
we're going through and kind of like

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,038
looking at reusing them

68
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,639
parapets do not really collect water so

69
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,479
this can help prevent over watering of

70
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,199
plants allows them to drain through very

71
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,598
easily

72
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,238
and also many fiber pots are washable

73
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,000
and can be

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,319
reused so it's another potential

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
advantage we see here we're using a

76
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,359
solid container

77
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,479
and then we're having the fabric pot

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
here with some

79
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,079
material at the bottom that will allow

80
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,560
it to drain very well and this is again

81
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
a way

82
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,199
particularly for new growers to help

83
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,839
prevent them from over watering their

84
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,039
plants

85
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,719
and if you're going through and wanting

86
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,000
to reuse that make sure you're giving it

87
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,919
a good scrub a good wash

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
of removing as much of the substrate as

89
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,079
possible so they can be reused

90
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,759
with reduced chance of contamination

91
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
from one crop to the other
