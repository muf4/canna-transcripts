1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,240
okay here we look at natural selection

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:09,928
and how it relates to behavior so

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,919
starting out natural suction and a by a

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,620
clear vision

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,948
so behavior in this sense we're looking

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,500
how in animal in this case has its eyes

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,000
oriented so binocular vision is having

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,339
two eyes and being able to perceive an

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,050
object in 3d there's five main

10
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,660
advantages to having two eyes versus

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,980
only one want to have a backup I in case

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,410
something happens to the left or the

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,380
right you have the other wider field of

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,500
view depth perception abilities see

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,320
around objects depending on the angle

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,628
and increased ability to detect faint

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,189
objects so its ability around a door so

18
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,349
I think this is like a superpower but if

19
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,539
you kind of ever seen something might be

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,039
blocking one of your eyes after you look

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,960
it through the other eye you're able to

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,120
see sometimes around something might be

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,649
obstructing your initial vision in the

24
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,858
well if you field of view and death

25
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,509
perception are all very important how

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,698
these relate is the position of the eyes

27
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,158
so I position can help determine if the

28
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,438
animals typically a prey or a predator

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,830
and this can influence its ability to

30
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,149
avoid one or find it the other so a

31
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,280
pigeon tends to be low in the food chain

32
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,439
and has a very wide field of view of

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,299
view the binocular vision area is very

34
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,868
small but its field of view is quite

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,118
large and I'll being a predator has a

36
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:28,200
reduced field of view but has a greater

37
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,030
amount of binocular vision some good

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,340
animals to kind of compare and how their

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,530
eyes might be oriented all these can be

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,210
found around my classroom the deer no

41
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,180
matter where you stand in the room

42
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:41,819
depending on long as you're not blocked

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,590
by anything the deer can see you the

44
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,478
raccoon and deer are both facing in the

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,180
same direction in my room in particular

46
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,450
so that when you look and you can be

47
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,770
seen by both as you work your way around

48
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,629
the raccoon will not a longer be able to

49
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,548
see you in a certain portion but the

50
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,228
deer will always be able to see you give

51
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,570
the example two of the aquatic species

52
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,530
the fish and the blue crab we also want

53
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:05,008
to be thinking about how their eye

54
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,718
position is important natural suction

55
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,368
behavior adaptive traits allow

56
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,539
evolutionary advantages in different

57
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,919
ways behaviors can reduce predation some

58
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,098
birds will take the eggshell

59
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,189
by goals to reduce predation by crows to

60
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:21,359
increase the camouflage of those eggs

61
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,520
other behaviors can enhance energy

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,980
uptake can allow more offspring to be

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,380
supported behaviors also can increase

64
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,179
resistance to disease example here's

65
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,879
eating a healthy diet can help reduce

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,200
your incidence of getting disease other

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,818
behaviors can enhance the ability to

68
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,969
acquire a mate here could be the mating

69
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,829
ritual or calls those are perfected or

70
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:44,269
performed well they can increase the

71
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,590
odds of finding and acquiring a mate

72
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,030
natural selection behavior every

73
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,550
behavior that offers a survival

74
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,519
advantage advantage for an individual

75
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,750
comes with an Associated cost for a

76
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,849
behavior to be favored by natural

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,299
selection the benefits must outweigh the

78
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,400
cost

79
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,260
give the example here of the penguin

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,590
courtship where the male penguin goes

81
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,359
around and creates a nest of rocks and

82
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,060
the goal is to have a better Rock

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,549
selection than those around him so that

84
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,969
the female will select him as an example

85
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:17,969
here cost and benefit ratio is involved

86
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,139
with Ella walks of life so the benefits

87
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,969
must outweigh the cost

88
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:24,328
otherwise it's not advantageous for that

89
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:25,829
species reproductive behaviors encompass

90
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,689
variety to animal behaviors including

91
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,489
courtship competition for meaning

92
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:33,000
opportunities has been termed sexual

93
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,680
selection intra sexual selection is

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,810
where individuals of the same sex

95
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,329
compete for a mate from the opposite sex

96
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,049
this is usually males and there's been

97
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,069
an entire TV shows dedicated to this

98
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,349
intersexual selection is essentially

99
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:49,459
mate choice where the females able to

100
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:52,229
select what meat they would like to have

101
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,930
so focusing a bit more on the

102
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,000
intersexual selection or mate choice for

103
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,319
the female the female is ideally looking

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,259
for a male that provides the best

105
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,539
offspring care who provide the best

106
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,879
territory could provide the best genes

107
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:09,150
on the Rams here they will butt heads

108
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,129
until on the alpha males determined and

109
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,799
the alpha male would be the one it's the

110
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,829
rights to the female here we see an

111
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,538
example here of two individuals who are

112
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,549
different amounts of showing this to

113
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:23,219
their feathers this male has a little

114
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,769
bit more showier feathers this female

115
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,690
selects that as a mate and then you can

116
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,579
see the resulting population

117
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,730
increases the showiness of their

118
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:36,449
feathers and some other good links to

119
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,250
some YouTube videos indicating showing

120
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:42,029
this mate choice in intersexual

121
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,769
selection the typical number of mates an

122
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,219
animal has during its breeding season

123
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:48,709
it's called the mating system so

124
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,720
monogamy is one male and one female

125
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:54,029
Coligny is one male in many females and

126
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,430
this is more common and polyandry

127
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:59,069
which is with one female with many males

128
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:04,050
and you could see them again represented

129
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:06,959
here what certain ape or monkey species

130
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,660
might participate in one of these chimps

131
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,180
are not giving one male and one female

132
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,670
and you could see here with one versus

133
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,980
many one male and many females polygamy

134
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,640
and polyandry is one female with many

135
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:24,509
males see the polygamy is much more

136
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:27,180
common in the world here of apes and

137
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:30,240
monkeys altruism

138
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,000
in group living so altruism is the

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,280
performance of an action that benefits

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,120
another individual at the cost of the

141
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:42,149
actor so helpers at the nest in some

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,889
bird species and some Tenniel's a term

143
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,709
for animals that give a predator alarm

144
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,229
calls give the meerkat example here so a

145
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:51,839
meerkat that specifically is on the

146
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,230
lookout for a potential harm to the

147
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,329
community

148
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,939
they then sound a call and let all the

149
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:58,589
individuals know this comes at a cost of

150
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,469
the individuals are constantly scouting

151
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:03,418
and they need to alert others and this

152
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,860
altruism is a behavior that's helpful to

153
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,289
others but clearly requires

154
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,509
self-sacrifice I give the example here

155
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,669
of giving to the homeless the existence

156
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,680
of all true truisms amongst animals is

157
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:15,389
rather perplexing and natural selection

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,360
should operate against it because

159
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,370
there's a cost to an individual so this

160
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,330
is where we get into the complexities of

161
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,459
some of the behaviors of animals

162
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:28,139
ultrajman group living so I'll choose

163
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,899
behavior may not truly be altruistic

164
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,149
after all the actor may have some sort

165
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,918
of repetitive nest helpers may get

166
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:38,788
parenting experience or inherit

167
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:41,519
territory syntel's may be able to escape

168
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:43,498
predators in the confusion on the alarm

169
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,728
so that's the example of the meerkats

170
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:46,409
they might sound the alarm

171
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:48,838
causing everyone to kind of scurry

172
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:50,819
around not sure what to do and maybe be

173
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,509
able to escape the predators in the most

174
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,629
of confusion

175
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,239
compute confusion can alters it

176
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,610
compensates for a reproduction reduction

177
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:01,459
of its own reproductive success by

178
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,778
increasing that of its relatives

179
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,429
selection that favors altruism directed

180
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:08,158
towards relatives is called kin

181
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:09,928
selection kin referring to family the

182
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:14,278
more closely related to individuals are

183
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:15,899
the grid the potential genetic payoff we

184
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:16,439
have is in here by this graph which i

185
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,928
think is great

186
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,119
it shows helpers tend to be close

187
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:23,518
relatives helpers assistants increased

188
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:25,199
with genetic relatedness so that

189
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,199
probability of helping the percent

190
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,088
increases here degree of relatedness so

191
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,009
the closer they're related the more

192
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:33,899
likely they are to help you kind of

193
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:35,519
relate this if you're moving or need to

194
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,309
be picked up from the airport you're

195
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,848
more likely ask a full sibling or maybe

196
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:43,338
a half sibling then you are a cousin or

197
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:45,990
someone more distantly related to you

198
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,610
hopefully this helps explain natural

199
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,329
selection and some behaviors associated

200
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,329
with that
