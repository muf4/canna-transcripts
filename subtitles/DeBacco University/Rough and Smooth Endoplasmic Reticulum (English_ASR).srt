1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,318
so here we learned about the rough and

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,240
smooth endoplasmic reticulum typically

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,400
referred to as the rough and the smooth

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,679
er you kind of see comparison between

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,960
the two animals here i've having a very

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,320
rough textured skin

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,240
a very smooth texture so that rough what

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,160
makes it rough what makes it smooth well

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,278
it is based on the texture but really

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,118
what gives the rough

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:25,039
er that rough kind of texture is

12
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,800
the ribosomes that it is kind of like

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,840
studded on it's kind of like attached to

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,519
the outside

15
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,960
giving it that rough appearance the

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,879
smooth has very few

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,880
ribosomes giving it that much smoother

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,480
more consistent look

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
so within that endoplasmic reticulum

20
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,599
it's a system of membranes and channels

21
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,640
of saccules which are just these

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,920
flattened

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,079
kind of vesicles are continuous with the

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,359
outer membrane of the nuclear envelope

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
so we're kind of going from the nucleus

26
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,640
and we're just leaving the nucleus when

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,198
we hit the endoplasmic reticulum

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
in particular this rough er is started

29
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,839
with ribosomes on the

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,198
cytoplasmic side and this allows for

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,960
protein production

32
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,320
so this is the synthesizing or the

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,040
creation or making of

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,040
those proteins it also allows for

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
proteins to be modified and processed it

36
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,799
can be

37
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,438
sugars can be added resulting in

38
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,080
glycoproteins

39
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,199
so this rough er with these ribosomes is

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,879
especially abundant in cells that

41
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,118
secrete a lot of proteins which makes

42
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,679
sense because it's the site of protein

43
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,519
production as a polypeptide it's

44
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
synthesized in a ribosome attached to

45
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,920
the rough er

46
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,239
it's threaded into the systerial

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,040
space so what you'll notice in this

48
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,798
picture

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,720
is kind of this high degree of surface

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
here a lot of these folds

51
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,118
this allows for a lot of these ribosomes

52
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,000
to be packed in in a very small

53
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,478
area these folds kind of create its

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
shape

55
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,478
and this is a very efficient shape as

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,000
well

57
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:52,959
i mentioned these glycoproteins so

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
a protein with a glycogroup so proteins

59
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,158
with a carbohydrate

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
can think of like a protein with glucose

61
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,799
attached for example

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,040
it's an example of a carbohydrate these

63
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000
proteins are packaged packaged into

64
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,719
transport

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
these kind of vesicles these curing

66
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,120
mediums

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,640
that can go to the next stage so while

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,719
information is coming out of the nucleus

69
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,719
going into the er not necessarily

70
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,000
finished when it leaves here it may have

71
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,878
one more step to finalize that and this

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,080
rough er

73
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,919
is a membrane factory as well these

74
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
membrane brown proteins are synthesized

75
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,399
directly into the membrane itself

76
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,599
so it's kind of like this system working

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
together

78
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,280
these enzymes in the rough er also

79
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,079
synthesized phospholipids from

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,280
precursors

81
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,719
in the cytosol of the cell now the

82
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,479
smooth er you can see kind of this

83
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,919
picture right here a little bit of a

84
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,399
contrast if you will

85
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,839
a very smooth in appearance but still

86
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,840
has a lot of folds

87
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
because there's basically no ribosomes

88
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,719
synthesis of lipids occurs

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,640
and it forms transport vesicles on the

90
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,000
site of various synthetic processes it

91
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,639
can also detoxify

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,039
and store things so the smoothie r does

93
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,238
have

94
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,439
vital functions specifically story

95
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
metabolizing

96
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,439
carbohydrates for the smooth er i could

97
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
synthesize and transport lipids which

98
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,639
are fats

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,080
and detoxify poisons in drugs such as

100
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,839
alcohol in the liver

101
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
so liver very important filter well it

102
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,800
contains a lot of this kind of smooth er

103
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,039
i can break down stored glucose and it

104
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,080
can help store calcium ions

105
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:29,120
in muscles so this er this smooth

106
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
er is found in a lot of cells and

107
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,039
performs a lot of

108
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,039
vital functions for our cell
