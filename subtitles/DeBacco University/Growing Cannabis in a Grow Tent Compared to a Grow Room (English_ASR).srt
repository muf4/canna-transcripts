1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,480
in this video on debaco university we're

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,200
going to be looking at growing cannabis

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:16,480
in a grow tent compared to a grow room

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,080
so come join us

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,000
all right let's compare both of these

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,599
indoor spaces

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
so first off when we're talking about a

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,118
grow tent or a

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,800
room they're both indoor growing areas

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,518
and while tents can be quite large

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
in comparison smaller indoor locations

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,479
are grown

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,519
in tents with larger plantings or in

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,519
grow rooms

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,359
however grow tents do offer the ability

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600
to conduct isolated small-scale

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,159
experiments in isolated conditions

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,039
and do have their place potentially

19
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,799
thinking about

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,558
in general terms from male plants with

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,519
pollen trying to keep that in isolated

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,599
location

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
this can be a special importance again

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,559
we're talking about breeders

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,878
looking at isolating those male plants

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,359
away from a male away from a main grow

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,000
room

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,439
this could be advantageous for them for

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,558
sort of looking at conducting little

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,159
trials or different

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,239
lighting sequences or something where we

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,640
need control over the conditions

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,118
grow tent maybe offer that opportunity

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,719
as well as growing full term in

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,239
so first off the grow tents what are

36
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,039
some of the advantages associated with

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,399
grow tents

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000
well they're a great way to get started

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,439
with cannabis production or any really

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,118
any plant production

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,798
as it allows for small controlled

42
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,438
environments and

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,280
allows people the advantage of

44
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,118
potentially having them in small closets

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,439
or areas that might be

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,200
size limited they also make great for

47
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,559
isolated areas for comparison if you're

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
trying to compare two different things

49
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,400
in one isolated environment for that

50
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,839
grow tents offer that advantage it's

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,840
also quick and easy to set up and

52
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,359
maintain a variety of general room

53
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
environments for looking at having

54
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,959
potentially a veg grow tent

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
and then a flower grow tent maybe a

56
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,000
drying cure grow tent it offers those

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
advantages

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,118
however the disadvantages of rotans is

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,519
simply they're small

60
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,599
in size they're just a little size

61
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,599
restrictive even the largest ones

62
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,118
you can also have a high cost to plant

63
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,959
ratio because you have to support

64
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,478
each individual environment with all the

65
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,078
necessary equipment

66
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,599
and they only alter the environment to

67
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,039
some degree so if you have a grow tent

68
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,519
in a room that's very hot

69
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,439
to be hard to sufficiently cool that

70
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
just as the opposite it's a really cold

71
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,598
might be hard to sufficiently heat that

72
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,520
area compare that to a grow room the

73
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,159
advantages of a grow room is just simply

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,319
their

75
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,680
large area an ability to regulate the

76
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,560
room to match the conditions of the

77
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,879
plant

78
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,878
and allows for very efficient plant

79
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,439
production simply because of the scale

80
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,878
or the volume that's able to produce

81
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,199
however the disadvantages with growth

82
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,598
rooms is that they can be costly to

83
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,359
initially set up and it doesn't really

84
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,878
allow for plant isolations

85
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,239
yes you might kind of move them over to

86
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,079
one area or another but for the most

87
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,080
part they're all in the same environment

88
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
this can also lead to quick disease or

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
insect spread especially if you have a

90
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,000
high plant

91
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,759
density in a limited area here of a grow

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,598
room where we're looking at kind of

93
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,479
everything being packed in despite its

94
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,399
large size

95
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,318
the plant density is still very high

96
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
here and that can lead to some spread of

97
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,359
disease potentially quicker

98
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,719
if those plants are spaced out a little

99
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,599
bit more so you want to weigh the

100
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,318
options for your

101
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,919
indoor growing situation decide whether

102
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:08,719
you want to choose to grow in a grow

103
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,158
tent

104
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,158
or a grow room
