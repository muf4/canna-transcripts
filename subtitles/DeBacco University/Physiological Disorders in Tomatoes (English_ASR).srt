1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,068
so physiological disorders and tomatoes

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,660
what causes them the main cause is both

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:10,830
extremes extreme cold or extreme heat so

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,780
when we're looking at extreme cold

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,910
looking at frost damage this would be

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,039
blackened splotches and the leaves most

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,719
evident in the upper leaves how to

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,000
prevent will protect your plants in some

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,309
way with some sort of cover or really

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,050
had a controller just add heat or be

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,118
mindful if you're putting them on early

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,050
planting out don't put all your Tomatoes

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,488
out so you don't lose the entire crop

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,739
leaf burns the other one it's a Browning

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,919
those leaves you see here often confused

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,659
with disease be careful when you make

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,410
applications this could be evidence of

18
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,659
spray damage with a high Sun I want to

19
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,609
shade your young seedlings when they

20
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,439
first go out into this field and how to

21
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,750
control it well nothing can be done once

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,519
the leaves burn that's a very quick

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,128
rundown of the extremes that caused

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,129
physiological disorders in tomato plants
