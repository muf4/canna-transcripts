1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
and when you first look at a scientific

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,028
article it may seem like a daunting task

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,179
to try to make any sense of what's going

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:11,280
on with its small font in its two column

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,650
format I'm gonna try to break down what

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,799
a scientific article contains so you get

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,510
appreciation for the power that is

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,050
present in a very typically a very small

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,550
amount of space here so first off I'll

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,439
start with the title this helps

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,330
determine if in articles of interest to

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,740
you typically provides a reasonable

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,809
complete description of the study that

14
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,070
was conducted and then the title should

15
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,719
be included the species that were

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,210
studied the kinds of experiments

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,850
performed and at times a brief

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,410
indication of the results so just

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,570
reading that title is a good first step

20
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,669
but don't just completely be dissuade by

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,710
that you may want to go on to another

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,320
very important part of a scientific

23
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,179
article that's the abstract this is a

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,738
very succinct summary very straight to

25
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,198
the point it's an example of one right

26
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,909
here an object contains brief statements

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,189
of the purpose the method results in the

28
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,750
conclusions of this study after X are

29
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,089
usually free and often included in

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,159
article databases so typically get the

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,630
title and an abstract and getting much

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,090
beyond that is where you typically have

33
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,530
to pay kind of like the teaser these are

34
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,189
just kind of a brief overview of what's

35
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,219
going on but something that really is

36
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,438
very pointed at summarizing the article

37
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,840
did tell you if you do want to explore

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,519
any further from there you would go on

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,409
to the introduction this contains

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,109
background information of the author's

41
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,490
hypothesis introduction also usually

42
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,590
describes a theoretical background

43
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,688
indicates why the work is important

44
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,270
states a specific research question

45
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,399
imposes a specific hypothesis to be

46
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:40,170
tested and usually don't start with once

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,060
upon a time but it's kind of getting

48
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,790
into that introduction that background

49
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,219
information of the author's hypothesis

50
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,399
kind of making these connections here to

51
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:53,219
what the main point of this article is

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,989
about those leads to the methods and

53
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,319
this describes exactly how the author's

54
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:00,449
perform an experiment and a way so that

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,618
it can be recreated if you think about

56
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,570
this is kind of like ingredients is

57
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:08,580
included as part of like a recipe to

58
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,769
make something is it repeatable it

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,030
describes exactly the process you should

60
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,760
go through and every time you follow

61
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,770
that you should get the same end result

62
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,049
mrs. describe the experimental design is

63
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,610
often skipped so a lot of people say you

64
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,830
don't have to really read the method the

65
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,360
methods section but it's very important

66
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,130
to read the method section as this can

67
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,020
tell you if there are inaccuracies with

68
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,539
the procedure which can dramatically

69
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,189
impact the validity of the findings so

70
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,650
whether or not you trust the end result

71
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,409
it's going to depend or hinge a lot on

72
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,810
the actual methods that those scientists

73
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,859
chose to use and if you follow the

74
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,080
methods and they don't make a lot of

75
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,770
sense well then you can't really hold a

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,150
lot of weight with their in the results

77
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,200
the results section will be following

78
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,909
this and this contains the data

79
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,919
collected during the experimentation

80
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,240
process much of the important

81
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,119
information including the sections in

82
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,409
tables graphs are often included here a

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,550
lot of people just look at the tables

84
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,319
and graphs but you also want to read

85
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,410
some of the background and especially

86
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,819
the captions video will can analyze the

87
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,379
raw data and draw their own conclusion

88
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,449
which is why reading the previous method

89
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,609
section is so important if you just look

90
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,949
at the results but have no idea how they

91
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,600
went about collecting those results can

92
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,759
really impact whether your degree of

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,829
trust or comfort with accepting those

94
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,810
results there's then there's in the

95
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,420
discussion phase section I should say

96
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,370
this explains the author's interpret of

97
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,500
the data and how it connects to their

98
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,909
work authors often use discussion

99
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,800
describe what their work suggests and

100
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,090
how it relates to other studies it's

101
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,490
kind of that conversation that's

102
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,200
occurring again while it is a written

103
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,360
text kind of having that conversation

104
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,269
about what the results show and help me

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,680
connect to other things and last we have

106
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,240
the literature cited and that's all the

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,950
sources throughout they're cited

108
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,270
throughout the paper it's a good idea to

109
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,159
look over the section to see what

110
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,990
sources were used and how the dates

111
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,840
compared to the published date or is

112
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,060
there a large gap between them are many

113
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,150
relatively close what type of topic is

114
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,860
it all things worth a consideration this

115
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,719
section is also helpful for generating a

116
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,360
list of background reading on the topic

117
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,550
that's under study and give you a lot of

118
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,680
kind of one book we lead to another may

119
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,420
lead to another article that really is

120
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,189
somewhat kind of its massive information

121
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,139
so you're able to understand the bigger

122
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,029
picture rather than just the single

123
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,699
topic so hopefully this kind of

124
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,048
clarified a scientific article breaks it

125
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,029
down a little bit more and makes it less

126
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,709
intimidating so you can try to research

127
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:27,388
one find one that's of interest to you

128
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,068
be able to understand

129
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,819
and appreciate the work that went into

130
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,819
its creation
