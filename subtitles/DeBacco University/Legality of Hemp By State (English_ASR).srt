1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,879
welcome in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,359
this is going to investigate the

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,679
legality of hemp by state

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,559
and try to touch on most of the states

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,040
and kind of give you an

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,000
overview here again most of the data

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,079
here is always

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,440
probably changing so this is good for at

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,079
least a point in time

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,800
reference and on that note i make just

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,038
kind of a disclaimer note here

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
that this is lecture is not meant to

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
serve as legal advisement if you're

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,518
seeking legal assistance please contact

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
your lawyer involved in the hemp

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,479
cannabis

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
industry the slide shows interpretation

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,679
as of

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,120
that may 7th to november time frame 2020

20
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,799
for complete up-to-date information

21
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,199
please check with your state authorities

22
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,878
as

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
always this is again just meant to be a

24
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,159
point in time kind of reference

25
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,399
maybe to get you thinking about maybe

26
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,558
get you started but always seek out

27
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
legal advice for the latest in current

28
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,320
information

29
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,679
so what's the importance of this why

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,399
even go over this in the first place

31
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,840
well

32
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,759
in the 2018 farm bill defines hemp

33
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,400
as in part acids with delta 9 thc

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,719
concentration of not more than 0.3

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
percent on a dry weight basis

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,079
however some states have interpreted

37
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,920
this a little differently

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,679
some states kind of take this statement

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,640
literally to mean only

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,400
the delta nine thc content in hemp would

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,118
be used for determining compliance with

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,280
the state

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,799
and federal statutes however other

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
states for example

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,640
oregon interpret the federal statute to

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,320
mean that

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,118
because thca is an acid cannabinoid that

48
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,919
contains

49
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,759
thc it therefore must be added to the

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
thc concentration

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,879
to ensure that their total concentration

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
does not exceed

53
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,039
0.3 percent so i also have another video

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,840
comparing the

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
total thc versus the delta 9 so that's

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,399
important again to consideration

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,479
that's how you're getting these

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,640
different interpretations just like we

59
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,438
see the images here this first one on

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,079
top do you see

61
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,279
a vase or do you see two faces facing

62
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,798
each other in profile

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,718
or in this image do you see a duck in

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,719
this image or do you see a rabbit in

65
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,438
this image so it's again

66
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,000
states looking at the same 2018 farm

67
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,878
bill

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
have these different interpretations now

69
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,479
there's lack of standards across the

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
state

71
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,439
so this is part of the issue it's not

72
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,119
kind of like this nice little

73
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,520
checkerboard or chessboard here

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,159
where everything is nice and even some

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,760
states

76
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,759
that use the less than 0.3 percent delta

77
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,959
9 thc are listed here you can see quite

78
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,518
a few of them

79
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,239
states that define total thc and use

80
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,159
delta 9 thc plus the thca

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,280
are listed right here so again oregon

82
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,439
dimension

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,039
states that do not define total thc you

84
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,519
could see a large number of them listed

85
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,079
here

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,519
seats were nhc is illegal and there's a

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,879
couple listed there as well

88
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,800
again for more information there's a

89
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,560
link here and as always in the

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,040
description i have some sources

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,800
cited there as well looking to set a

92
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,479
couple of the states here is picking on

93
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,879
a couple areas here

94
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,039
states that use the less than 0.3 delta

95
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,000
9 thc comparison montana kansas and

96
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,759
tennessee

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,519
and i kind of give you the definitions

98
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,759
here where montana is using

99
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,959
the test results of mature flowers from

100
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,799
the mother plants

101
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,800
kansas and that industrial hemp means

102
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
all parts varieties of the plant

103
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
of the cannabis sativa whether grown or

104
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,120
not it contained at delta 9

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,879
thc concentration of not more than 0.3

106
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
percent on a dry weight basis

107
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,000
in tennessee's looking at thc means

108
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
delta

109
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,560
9 thc states that define

110
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,840
total thc and use delta 9 thc

111
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,759
plus thca for comparison would be the

112
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
examples here would be arkansas

113
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,158
in minnesota and they're using these

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,680
equations that take into account

115
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:48,158
the delta nine thch being thc

116
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,719
plus the 0.877 times the thc a which

117
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,359
could be

118
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,239
theoretically converted to that delta 9

119
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
thc

120
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,360
others will go as far like minnesota to

121
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
define its analyzed

122
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
via high pressure liquid chromatography

123
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,719
methodology

124
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,318
so again we're looking at also defining

125
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,080
potentially how your even

126
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,318
what method you're using what protocols

127
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
you're using to generate that thc level

128
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,158
again other videos on this channel to

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,639
get into that a little bit more detail

130
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,598
states that do not define the total thc

131
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,238
comparisons

132
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,759
and we see quite a few listed here ohio

133
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,000
virginia and michigan between that

134
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,840
pretty extensive kind of listing here

135
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,519
again these are just provided here to

136
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,198
give you that sense

137
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,799
of variability from one state to another

138
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
not even necessarily

139
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
bordering states and why is this kind of

140
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,199
important you know not to only

141
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,519
understand

142
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,879
your potential state laws but also when

143
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,918
you're looking at transporting

144
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,240
potential any product across state lines

145
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,758
it's best to use the total thc for all

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
product to ensure that you are not

147
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,199
federally charged with possession

148
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
in addition if your state does not

149
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
define total thc you should contact them

150
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,080
to see how they will be testing

151
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,520
or just assume the total thc because

152
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,079
that will theoretically give you the

153
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,599
highest

154
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,120
value so again this is just meant to be

155
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,840
at a point in time use this as

156
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
a reference only and hopefully this does

157
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,799
provide you

158
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
a little bit of an idea of some of the

159
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,199
variability that doesn't

160
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,199
occur from one state to the next
