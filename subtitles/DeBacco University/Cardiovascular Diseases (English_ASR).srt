1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,318
okay here we're gonna go over some

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,548
common cardiovascular diseases give you

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,199
a little bit about what's going on

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,719
behind them so you can have a greater

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,500
understanding of what's going on and how

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,518
the typical process of the

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,190
cardiovascular system is not working

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,710
properly starting with a very common one

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,689
heart attack or myocardial infarction

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,118
this is the leading cause of death in

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,070
the United States it's caused by an

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,289
insufficient supply of blood to one or

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,609
more parts of the heart muscle so while

14
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,500
the heart does go through and moves

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,570
blood throughout the body because it

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,479
itself is a muscle it needs to be

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,890
supplied with its own blood supply

18
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,199
coronary arteries can become blocked as

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,450
we see here with Platt and this can lead

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,450
to damage to the heart muscle leading

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,239
ultimately to a heart attack here is the

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,600
heart disease death rates from 2011 to

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,988
2013 in adults over 35 over the country

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,770
we see an increase rate of heart attacks

25
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:00,599
in this particular region of the country

26
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:03,390
how we negate heart attacks or how they

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,280
may be hopefully prevented if detected

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,760
early such as blockages in the coronary

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,930
artery would be through an angioplasty

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,320
angioplasty involves placing a wire mesh

31
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,320
to hold the artery open they will insert

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,938
this wire mesh through a long tube

33
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,829
typically in the groin region will

34
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,539
Gateway up to the heart ultimately

35
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,649
getting to the blockage region and then

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,439
literally like a balloon they kind of

37
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,109
open this up and they plaster the plaque

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,399
against the side walls they will then

39
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:34,438
leave a mesh in there to help hold that

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,840
artery open wide so that blood can

41
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,769
easily flow through there allowing the

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,219
muscles of the heart

43
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:42,959
dig it adequate flow of blood so they

44
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,469
can perform their very necessary and

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:49,379
continual function continuing on the

46
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:52,109
strokes they typically result a blood

47
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,728
clot in your brain but can it also occur

48
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,819
with pressure on the brain as a result

49
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:59,399
of inflammation so it could be an actual

50
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,199
blockage or this is why if there's head

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,930
trauma swelling with the brain is a

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,659
major concern because that can also lead

53
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,280
to stroke like symptoms we're looking at

54
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,979
the stroke deaths rates across the

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,449
country again adults over 35 years old

56
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,920
in 2002 to 2007 and

57
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:17,530
you see a concentration in this

58
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,969
particular region of the country now if

59
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,039
you think someone's experiencing a

60
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:25,539
stroke the despot Authority is the

61
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,370
acronym here fast for one is the face we

62
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:30,639
begin to kind of weaken or droop in one

63
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,789
side they will do the toll to put their

64
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,529
arms out and keep them level and

65
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:39,699
oftentimes one become weak and fall down

66
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,500
and slowly the ability to speak might

67
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,628
become a challenge for that individual

68
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,870
so they're often told to kind of keep

69
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:50,649
talking and to monitor that and if this

70
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,719
is found out be time to call 9-1-1 so

71
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,980
this stroke and those things to look

72
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,348
forward numbness or weakness in the face

73
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:59,078
arm or leg especially on one side of the

74
00:02:56,348 --> 00:03:01,268
body typically it's not both sides more

75
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,010
evident on one side there can be

76
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,560
confusion or trouble understanding or

77
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:07,719
speaking send trouble seeing or blurred

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,739
vision trouble walking dizziness or loss

79
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,509
of balance I included a link here where

80
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,120
you to see an individual actually have a

81
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:18,039
minor stroke and are actually explaining

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,629
to you in the video while it's actually

83
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,269
happening to them so a pretty

84
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:27,870
interesting video they're now monitoring

85
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:31,389
blood pressure we have a sig you know a

86
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,430
size fitting monitor which is used for

87
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,930
two measurements I'm sure you've had

88
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,189
this done in doctors office where they

89
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,409
put the cuff on and they build that

90
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:40,989
pressure up and are basically stopping

91
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,900
the blood flow and what they're doing is

92
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,299
they're listening for the pulse and

93
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,760
they're measuring the systolic in distal

94
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,950
pressure the High Point and low point

95
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,530
and they're using this to gauge your

96
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,449
blood pressure and ultimately your heart

97
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,739
health

98
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:59,649
now those blood pressures you may hear

99
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,870
those numbers of you know 120 over 80

100
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,599
and it says millimeters of mercury is

101
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,099
what they're measuring blood flows with

102
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,169
pressure through your body however too

103
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:09,789
much can cause hypertension we have

104
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,649
negative impacts such as damage on your

105
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,409
arteries as well increasing heart

106
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,750
attacks and strokes so if you know your

107
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:19,029
numbers you can compare to this want to

108
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,339
be in this normal green region here we

109
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,038
can see elevated hypertension stage 1

110
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,139
stage 2 and a crisis mode here with

111
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:27,339
seeking emergency care and this is

112
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,909
numbers

113
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,259
by the American Heart Association

114
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,480
continuing on to stay healthy seven

115
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,860
steps eat the healthier heart and take a

116
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,050
moment to pause the video and read them

117
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,030
here smoke for your life monitoring your

118
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,829

sugar

121
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,079
staying active in having a healthy diet

122
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:49,329
are all components of the healthier

123
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,310
heart it doesn't involve just one thing

124
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:53,740
it's important have a healthy lifestyle

125
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,449
in general wearable devices have become

126
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,790
all the rage and it's helping people

127
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,750
keep track of their exercise but you

128
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,229
don't need to go through this hike

129
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,910
technologically advanced stage you just

130
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:06,099
want to calculate your normal heart rate

131
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,720
this is the mathematical equation you

132
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,879
want to feel your pulse is the second

133
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,950
hand of a watch or clock to time 10

134
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,050
seconds while simultaneously counting

135
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:15,759
your heartbeats then multiply the number

136
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,400
of beats by six to get your heart rate

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,370
per minute or number of beats the equals

138
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,538
that time six hit your beats per minute

139
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,699
factors it may affect your heart rate

140
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:27,250
the exercise meditation illness and

141
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:30,069
anemia stress so on and so forth looking

142
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,139
at the age groups here I'm in the ranges

143
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:34,060
of heartbeats you can do it to yourself

144
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,129
you want to use three fingers to know

145
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,649
the image here leaves is to threes a

146
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,839
little bit better and calculate your

147
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:43,060
heart rate value your beats per minute

148
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,668
and see where you fall on this range

149
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,819
hopefully you're in the athletic to kind

150
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:51,129
of good range above average average

151
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,469
below average and Poor's be more

152
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,449
negative here you might want to consider

153
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,490
living making adjustments to realize

154
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,779
you're living a healthier lifestyle so

155
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,819
go through calculate your normal heart

156
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:02,819
rate see see where you fall
