1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
here I'm going to go over the importance

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,899
of crime at scene sketching so what's

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,480
the importance of being a little sketch

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,919
ascribes Kane well they're essential

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,170
documents in this step within the

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,388
processing protocol you need to be able

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,129
to sketch a crime scene or what's going

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,799
with the objects you may have

9
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,108
photographed what's going in that room

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,850
or that area need to be sure you're

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,779
including which means you also need to

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:31,140
take these dimensions distance content

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,700
in relationship of items of evidence so

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,989
all these things must be taken into

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,059
account while you're there at the crime

16
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,609
scene so you can generate a quality

17
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,738
sketch that will uphold in court now

18
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,030
sketches versus photographs while many

19
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:43,679
may think photographs are the most

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,049
important item sketches can actually

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,119
show more comprehensive view of the

22
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,089
crime scene so you see an example here

23
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,189
of kind of the one level of the house a

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,530
photographs women take into account

25
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,689
portion of this this gives us a larger

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,100
perspective sketches should be

27
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,049
supplements to photographs in order to

28
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,300
provide a comprehensive description of

29
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,399
the crime scene so while we may be

30
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,289
looking at the table here

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,900
this is sketch is going to provide

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,640
context to that photograph so they kind

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,950
of go hand in hand but keep in mind

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,450
sketches are very important this

35
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,519
includes a lot of those essential

36
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,640
elements also including the direction of

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,319
north it's also important consideration

38
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,118
so the purpose of the sketch to document

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,829
the exact location in relationship of

40
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,900
physical items in the crime scene

41
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,259
provide a permanent record of those

42
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,390
conditions could see here more sketches

43
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,280
of more dimensions we want to relate to

44
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,259
the sequence of events that may have

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,150
occurred and in court settings sketches

46
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,618
help prosecutors judges and the jury

47
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,170
understand the crime scene by providing

48
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,118
an overall view of the area keep in mind

49
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,250
is people very likely have never been

50
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,530
there and are reliant on you to supply

51
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,149
them with information these lines here

52
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,549
show doors and it shows the way that

53
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,079
doors open so keep in mind that knowing

54
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,868
which way the doors open can also be

55
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,149
important when looking at angles of

56
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,340
attackers or particularly bullet

57
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,590
trajectory can also something to date

58
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,030
the consideration that sketching

59
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,580
procedure you want to observe the entire

60
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,618
crime scene kind of unbiased ly you want

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,360
to outline area dimensions of the room

62
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,919
or rooms if you're sketching more on one

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,650
draw objects and

64
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,509
it's measured distances record all

65
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,840
details and add details such as the

66
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:24,539
legend title scale direction of north is

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,610
also very important so I start with the

68
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,739
blank sheet you have to not only know

69
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,870
you're going to be documenting all this

70
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,250
on a sketch but taking all these into

71
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,250
consideration while you're actively

72
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,659
there at the crime scene

73
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,019
general sketching notes kind of see a

74
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,359
nice little example here looking this is

75
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,310
not to scale but do not measure through

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,200
space oddly shaped items such as puddles

77
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,879
or liquids are trying related from the

78
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,738
center of mass you do not cross

79
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,989
measurement lines and always have the

80
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,780
sketch verified by someone other than

81
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,489
yourself that was also there we're

82
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,830
looking at you know place by we're not

83
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,709
having any lines crossed here we're

84
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,690
documenting sizes we have the window we

85
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,769
have the door we have to enter and exit

86
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,709
door so and you can there's no other

87
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,959
doors but there's a window here a lot of

88
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,549
information is easily provided here in

89
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,099
addition to all these letters here's the

90
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,269
legend here's the I type block here's

91
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,939
the information here's who it was

92
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:22,230
sketched by note it's not to scale and

93
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,060
also the direction of north so types of

94
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:27,659
sketches well there's different types an

95
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,439
example here be a rough sketch is kind

96
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,209
of one you want to just start with

97
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,039
France crime scene it's not a finished

98
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,629
product or polished product but it does

99
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,599
contain measurements and other data as

100
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,819
you can see here now within this rough

101
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,829
sketch we're looking at should show the

102
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,319
proportions with accurate measurements

103
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,519
but does not need to be to scale and

104
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,060
this is speaking particularly to the

105
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,950
rough sketch no changes should be made

106
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,959
once you leave the crime scene and it

107
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,250
requires a legend or a key so this is

108
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,989
something you're actually making while

109
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,639
you're actively there at the crime scene

110
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,159
line to ensure you have all the correct

111
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,318
measurements we have all the basic

112
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,870
information that you need and a legend

113
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,000
to know what you found in where it was

114
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,709
found

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,199
I'll brush sketch specifics so we can

116
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,700
see some more of these specifics

117
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,280
indicated here out it should be marked

118
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,780
with the letters evidence marked by a

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,100
circle number and those should

120
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,829
correspond with the photographs we've

121
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,039
also taken north is also indicated in

122
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,810
this case we have south east north and

123
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:26,668
west also indicated typically just need

124
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,750
to indicate north most relevant

125
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,269
materials are documented

126
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,069
typically done with and so you can see

127
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:35,459
which way the doors are opening here and

128
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,930
this other date marked as well so a

129
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,029
finished sketch was this different than

130
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,530
a finished sketch well finished sketch

131
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,359
shows the proper relationships and

132
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:44,519
scales the finished sketch is more

133
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,790
presentable for court presentations may

134
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:50,159
be professionally produced this finished

135
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,560
sketch in addition will emit measurement

136
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,840
lines all items the rough sketch must be

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,750
included with no editing myself over

138
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,979
here note scale notations all

139
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,418
measurements should be orient in the

140
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,710
same direction for easy reading and

141
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:03,269
we're looking at the kitchen countertop

142
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,930
referent points everything's in that

143
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,639
same orientation our head should touch

144
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,350
measurement lines if you are using that

145
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,839
as hidden objects should be indicated by

146
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,510
dotted lines no conclusion should be

147
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,119
noted on the drynesss it isn't image

148
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,459
over just what what was there objects

149
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,250
okay by training triangulation when

150
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,560
possible and the numbers should match

151
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,418
the numbers that are on the photographs

152
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,800
as well and again north is needs to be

153
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,599
indicated you can under case the other

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,720
cardinal directions as well be sure

155
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,030
including the legend time person and it

156
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,890
is so here going to look at a picture

157
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,969
picture of two sketches so we have our

158
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,370
finished sketch this is how it would

159
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,220
look and now we have a sketch here we

160
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,269
notice the details a triangulation

161
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,120
measurements included everywhere the

162
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,439
level of detail that's presented here

163
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,449
even though this is a rough sketch is

164
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,240
providing a lot of detail in information

165
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,399
this would be included as the evidence

166
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,680
and would potentially uphold a court

167
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,329
however a lot of times to simplify

168
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,610
things we might take this same image and

169
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:08,279
simplify it and after we have the image

170
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,720
here a little simplified with the legend

171
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,209
still occurring we sought the couch the

172
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,669
desk but here we're kind of omitting

173
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:16,379
some details so it's important to maybe

174
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:18,060
if we're looking at just highlighting

175
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,418
one particular object we can simplify it

176
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,860
but we need to have this also included

177
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,418
as part of evidence because it's to

178
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,680
showing where the door is this is

179
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,209
showing a lot more detail a lot more

180
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,668
measurements a lot more information on

181
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:32,069
in the one here we do see that it is

182
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:33,990
instant reports we see that rooms either

183
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,819
buildings see the location who it's

184
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,660
verified by in the cardinal direction

185
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,279
north so again keep in mind that when we

186
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,610
are sketching things it's very important

187
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,948
to

188
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,259
you sketch them well and include the

189
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,060
information needed while we're there at

190
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,310
the crime scene so we can have an

191
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,228
accurate portrayal of that information

192
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,228
that can be upheld in the court of law
