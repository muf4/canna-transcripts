1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,810
when looking at setting up a hydroponic

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,560
system there will be some equipment that

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,179
will be needed

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,889
now the specifics of the equipment that

5
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,900
you need will depend on your exact

6
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,268
system chosen but there are some things

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,719
that are true just about for all systems

8
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,980
so first off the minimum equipment like

9
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,379
and while there can be variability it

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,000
would be a water monitor of some kind

11
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:25,349
that will allow you to read the

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,689
temperature the EC or ppm and pH as well

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,429
also you need a quality water source or

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,130
to be able to make a quality water

15
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,439
source and precise measuring equipment

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,010
so that water monitor out blue labs

17
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,359
bluelab Guardian is particular here it's

18
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,579
important to always know the current

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,049
conditions of the water pH is important

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,829
but so is the EC and temperature and

21
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,988
that's why I like this kind of

22
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,808
all-in-one it allows for continual

23
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,578
checking and monitoring of it's a good

24
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:51,929
habit to get into to always have this

25
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,969
kind of reading that always making sure

26
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,469
the numbers are where you expect them to

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,350
be or within the range you expect them

28
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,510
to be here the ppm is a little high but

29
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,260
temperature is looks good and pH also

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:03,570
looks good

31
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,459
there's also wireless systems that can

32
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,409
allow you to nightly check on conditions

33
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,509
remotely so you even have to be in the

34
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,109
room but can also sometimes give you

35
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,820
alerts if a certain parameter has gone

36
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,129
over or under to give you that

37
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,649
indication without you constantly having

38
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:22,079
to check it also quality water source

39
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,909
it's important to know how your native

40
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,978
water test meaning what do you need to

41
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,570
do to modify that it's important also to

42
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,090
recheck whatever source you're using

43
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,709
over time to get an idea of a range so

44
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm just test it once and assume it's

45
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,188
always like that throughout the entire

46
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,408
year determine if you need to invest in

47
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,539
a filtration system it's best to meet

48
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,130
the native water conditions for example

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,380
if you have high salts or high water and

50
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:45,239
ro or reverse osmosis system might be

51
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,099
advised you have a lot of particulate

52
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,420
present sediment filter you have

53
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,118
chlorine coming out of tap water a

54
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,060
carbon filter may be your best option or

55
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,890
a combination of these your measure

56
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,390
equipment with hydroponics it's very

57
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,340
important to be exact with the nutrients

58
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,140
you're adding keep in mind looking at

59
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,180
these graduated cylinders there will be

60
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,280
this little bit of this kind of bend to

61
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,719
the water it's called the meniscus you

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,669
always want to be reading the value at

63
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,500
the bottom so while this water does come

64
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,619
up a little bit here in here this would

65
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,000
be a 40 unit measurement here

66
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,849
so we want to use the bottom of that

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,530
what's called the meniscus having

68
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:21,780
quality measure equipment is important

69
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,969
you know try to get different gradations

70
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,068
here these are graduated cylinders they

71
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,729
are very accurate beakers are not very

72
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:28,079
accurate

73
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,699
you always make sure you're cleaning

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,650
these before and after you use that

75
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,899
regarding of regardless of what

76
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,909
nutrients you are adding don't estimate

77
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,680
no value and be sure you're adding that

78
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,019
amount and check to confirm with your

79
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,629
water monitor if you sure those pH and

80
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,489
then as PPM's are hovering around where

81
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:46,409
you need to be and double check to make

82
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,009
sure you Dan over or under add your

83
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,009
nutrients
