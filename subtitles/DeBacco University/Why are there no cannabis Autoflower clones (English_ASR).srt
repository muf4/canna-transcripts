1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,160
are you a fan of autoflowers but

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
wondered why there are no cannabis

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,759
autoflower clones available

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,279
well here at this debaco university

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,839
we're going to answer that question for

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:17,009
you

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:19,759
right here in this video

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,359
[Music]

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
all right let's get into answering this

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
question on why there are no cannabis

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
autoflower clones

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,799
so i want you first to realize that if

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
this is possible cloning an autoflower

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,599
is possible but the resulting plant will

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,759
flower

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
much too early to produce any viable

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,879
yield so

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
why is this the case that it is possible

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,239
to get an autoflower to root

20
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,679
but it's going to yield so much earlier

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,159
why is that the case we're taking a

22
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,159
small

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,599
little clone from the original stock or

24
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,119
mother plant

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,520
well this is important because cloning

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,919
does not reset the plant's internal

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,160
clock so we want to keep this in mind

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
that the clone follows the timeline as

29
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,119
the mother or stock plant

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
meaning if the mother or stock plant is

31
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,959
an autoflower plant it takes about 10

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
weeks or so just as an example

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
from seed to flower and you clean it on

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,079
week six

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
the clone will heart will be in harvest

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,679
mode in only about

37
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,438
four weeks because it's still set on

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
that 10-week

39
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,519
seed to flowering time scale with the

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
stress of cloning this process

41
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,798
will result typically in minimal yields

42
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
a small plant

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,118
so again that timing and resetting the

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,320
plant clock simply doesn't happen

45
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,079
just because you clone that plant

46
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,639
so keep in mind as a reminder

47
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,959
autoflowers are simply based on days old

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
not the duration of light so once the

49
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,599
plant emerges the clock basically starts

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
on an autoflower

51
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,199
so if you clone a plant a material it is

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
still

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,280
x days old the cloning process does not

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,560
cause the plant to start from day one

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,599
again even though it's a small plant

56
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159
even though we're kind of going through

57
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,719
that

58
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
uh regrowing process does not reset that

59
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,759
plant's internal clock

60
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
instead the plant keeps counting from

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,519
when it first emerged

62
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,880
this is why clones from autoflowers are

63
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,560
not going to be worthwhile

64
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,158
for total yield even though it is

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,118
possible to get them to root and to grow

66
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,719
into plants

67
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,319
they're definitely going to be smaller

68
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,839
plants there

69
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,438
so is there a situation for cloned

70
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,159
autoflowers you know just speaking in

71
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,239
general

72
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,479
in isolated cases for potential breeding

73
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,640
of lineages but this does not pertain to

74
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,359
very many growers and therefore this is

75
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,238
why

76
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,400
you don't see autoflowers as an example

77
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,400
if you're looking at purchasing clones
