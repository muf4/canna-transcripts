00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,089
i'm going to go over regulating humidity

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:14,160
in a cannabis grow facility

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:15,199
[Music]

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,118
all right let's go over some of the

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,118
complexities and understand a little bit

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,399
better regulating humidity in a cannabis

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,559
grow facility

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,879
all right so humidity what is humidity

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,079
well humidity is the measure of water

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,839
vapor in the air

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,678
many viewers think it's unavoidable and

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,678
while this is true to some extent if

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,238
humidity goes unregulated the plants

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,799
could

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,759
become more likely to get powdery mildew

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,679
or bud rot if levels are too high

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,679
they could also suffer from leaf burn or

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,238
water stress if the levels become too

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,600
low so what's the optimum humidity well

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,359
it's going to actually depend on the

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,439
stage of growth of your plant

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,280
the clones and vegetative are typically

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,960
higher levels of humidity and as the

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,920
plant ages in the flowering and final

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,920
weeks of flowering

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,198
the humidity level or ideal humidity

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
levels begins to

29
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,799
decrease there for a cannabis plant

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
now to control humidity you need control

31
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,920
over the

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,439
environment so to gain better control

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
over the growing environment growers

34
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,839
need to isolate their grow rooms

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
but air circulation is also still

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,240
important so you want to create this

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,679
kind of sealed up bubble

38
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,359
you want to have a way of regulating

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
this and

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,400
a way to kind of monitor the air flow as

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
well

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
sealing off and insulating the grow area

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,880
is one way

44
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,158
to get isolation from the outside

45
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,920
environment but it's important

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
regardless of the outside conditions to

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,719
make sure you are still having

48
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,560
air movement within the facility

49
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,840
temperature regulation also impacts

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
humidity so when we're talking about

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
humidity that's important

52
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,759
we also want to look at how humidity and

53
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,759
air temp kind of play off one another

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,959
temperature regulation is important for

55
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
the plants in general

56
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,239
but how this is accomplished can impact

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,240
the humidity levels

58
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,478
for air conditioning units make sure the

59
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,239
unit is sized appropriately to reduce

60
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,039
the chance of large temperature swings

61
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,519
from a unit

62
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,399
that is either too large or too small

63
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,798
for the growing

64
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,799
area the goal is to have your unit run

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,479
for consistent cycles for longer

66
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,280
durations to moderate the temperature

67
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:06,718
changes

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,000
you don't want it to get too hot and get

69
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,280
too cold and get too hot and get too

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,400
cold you want to kind of keep it

71
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,080
at a even keel there avoid short on and

72
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,239
off cycles which will reduce the life

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
expectancy of your air conditioning unit

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,039
and it's also not beneficial to the

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,759
plants and i'm going to wear your unit

76
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,079
out quicker

77
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,280
but you're also not going to benefit the

78
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,800
plants in any way

79
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,318
and here we're seeing when we take our

80
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
air temperature and decrease

81
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,399
our air temperature going from 28

82
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,399
degrees celsius to 24

83
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
just that change in temperature can also

84
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
impact the humidity

85
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,480
and we see our relative humidity

86
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,799
acceptable range here changing

87
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,799
with the temperatures now that

88
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
temperature in humidity we're looking at

89
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
the

90
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
vapor pressure deficit here temperature

91
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,039
humidity are inversely proportional

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
when the temperature goes down the

93
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,159
humidity is

94
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,319
on the increase this is why swings in

95
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,318
temperature impact humidity as well

96
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,719
which will relate to potential disease

97
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,399
pressures so the goal for your facility

98
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,400
should be consistency

99
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,158
monitoring your levels and knowing what

100
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
levels are your target levels

101
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,280
so you can be aware that you are within

102
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,158
that acceptable

103
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,120
range as i said the importance of air

104
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,519
circulation

105
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,599
so oscillating fans are a good start but

106
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,039
a room with a dense canopy fluorophanes

107
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,119
may also be needed

108
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,598
the goals maintain consistency across

109
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
all portions of a fully grown plant

110
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,518
we just want to have good air

111
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,119
circulation in the bottom a good air

112
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
solution to the top we want to make sure

113
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
we're mixing that air in a vertical

114
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,480
sense as well

115
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,318
as in a horizontal test sense because

116
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,598
air circulation is still important at

117
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,719
all stages

118
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,158
of plant development if you are using

119
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,759
water tanks you want to make sure that

120
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,519
they are being covered

121
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,919
you also want to be checking your water

122
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,519
drains because to limit the amount of

123
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,719
water that may naturally enter growth

124
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,400
space to be sure to cover

125
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,318
any water reservoirs you may have you

126
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,560
don't want to have this artificially

127
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,158
increasing level of humidity

128
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,920
also make sure that the drains are

129
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,519
actually draining excess water

130
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,359
it's not just a large puddle on the

131
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,719
floor sure that water is getting to that

132
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
drain and going actually down

133
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,239
the drain both of these may seem obvious

134
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,158
but are still worth

135
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
mentioning and always worth that double

136
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,560
check to ensure that your

137
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,199
reservoirs if you have any are sealed

138
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,478
and your drains are draining properly

139
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,319
for additional help you might want to

140
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,399
use a dehumidifier

141
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,478
so dehumidifiers remove moisture from

142
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,399
the air these units may be needed

143
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,240
more during the mid to late portions of

144
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,079
the growing season because the increase

145
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
in plant matter that you should have in

146
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,279
your growing facility

147
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,879
make sure that it is a commercial grade

148
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,599
not a residential homeowner

149
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,560
a great dehumidifier residential models

150
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,560
while cheaper

151
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,478
are also electrically inefficient and do

152
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,918
not hold up under the workload of a grow

153
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,599
room with a lot of transpiration

154
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,279
occurring with your plants

155
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,720
a proper dehumidifier will save you

156
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,439
money in the long run

157
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,280
though proper humidity control and as a

158
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,319
result to reduce potential loss

159
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,918
from disease so really it's important if

160
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,719
you need a dehumidifier you get a

161
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,198
commercial one

162
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
one set or size for your facility

163
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,319
because it can really save you a lot in

164
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
the long run

165
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,519
so where does this humidity come from i

166
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,680
talked about and it's from the plants

167
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,359
well plants transpire about 97 percent

168
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
of the water they absorb so 90 of the

169
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
water comes up

170
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
and out the stomata of the leaves

171
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,319
growers are suggested to have multiple

172
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,839
units to properly regulate the humidity

173
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,759
you want to have one big unit in the

174
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,799
corner you want to have multiple units

175
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,120
to ensure that there's an

176
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,079
even distribution or control over the

177
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
humidity in

178
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,079
a growing room multiple units offer that

179
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
more even control

180
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,719
over this over a larger space and also

181
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,479
redundancy if one unit was to fail

182
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,240
the entire growth space does not fail

183
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,918
with it you have that kind of backup

184
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,918
and systems yes others might be a little

185
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,758
overworked but at least you won't lose

186
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,839
the entire crop

187
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,439
so if you're in the opposite situation

188
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,599
where you want to increase the humidity

189
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,959
levels you want to use a humidifier

190
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,879
and these can produce a constant flow of

191
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,560
water vapor for an indoor garden which

192
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,918
may be needed if natural air is

193
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,519
especially dry

194
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,879
this could be particularly to your

195
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,399
region it's because if you're using

196
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,360
heaters that could naturally dry out the

197
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,279
air

198
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,800
cool water is used to create a mist that

199
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,879
dissipates throughout the space and

200
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,960
increases those moisture levels

201
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,800
again to bring them up to your desired

202
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,839
target levels

203
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,240
lastly avoid competing systems

204
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,159
so getting both the temperature and

205
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
humidity in balance can be a difficult

206
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,319
task

207
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,079
however knowing the natural conditions

208
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
of your outside air may

209
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,439
help you want to adjust your light

210
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
cycles to be during the natural

211
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,038
night of the day to reduce the heat of

212
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,839
the lights compounding with the heat of

213
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,439
the day

214
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,279
so if you're going to completely indoor

215
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,160
space those plants are isolated from the

216
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,439
outside

217
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
just because the sun's out doesn't mean

218
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,600
your lights have to be on you can

219
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,280
help kind of absorb some of that heat

220
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,800
some of those differences by having your

221
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,758
plants essentially experiencing the

222
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,879
daytime

223
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,879
during what would be the natural

224
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,399
nighttime when it's cooler out so these

225
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,199
are different ways that growers can

226
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,519
manipulate

227
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,680
completely controlled indoor situations

228
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,959
to try to reduce the stress on the

229
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,478
equipment and systems

230
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,159
to try to maintain the target humidity

231
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,079
as well as temperature levels in their

232
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,199
growth space to help maximize

233
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,199
plant production
