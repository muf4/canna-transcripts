1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
okay a term commonly used in the

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,439
cannabis industry is concept of mother

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,449
plants these plants are also considered

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,309
stock plants and there are plants that

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,099
are unique genetics that are going to be

6
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:16,649
the source of many offspring in the

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,240
sense of many clones and that's why

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,399
they're called the mother plants so the

9
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,038
mother room is where these plants will

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,409
be kept so mother plants is one that we

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,090
used to generate many clones this can be

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,039
referred to as a stock plant since it is

13
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,500
the main source of propagation material

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,870
for future plans and typically around

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,308
two months old so they're kind of that

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,349
one plant and going to have all these

17
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,289
identical offspring that are going to

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,550
come from that one stock plant they want

19
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,530
to ensure that the mother plants in good

20
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,449
health and has desired traits it's

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,850
critical for the success of any grow

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,289
operation any female plant that can

23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,600
become a mother plant and the original

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,460
plant material can be a seed or a clone

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,929
so you want to make sure they're in peak

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,280
of health want to make sure they're

27
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,619
getting all the nutrients that they need

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,960
now over fed now under fed and proper

29
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:04,969
moisture conditions they're not going

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,260
under any biotic or abiotic stresses

31
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:08,789
maximize a cannabinoid production for

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,960
example a six-month-old plant will

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,970
produce more cannabinoids in a

34
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,469
one-month-old plant and one-month-old

35
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,450
clone can actually behave more like a

36
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,890
four-month-old plant and can be

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,140
encouraged to flower in a shorter

38
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,019
interval by photo period adjustment so

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,728
this can also help maximize production

40
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,179
if we're looking especially at a large

41
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:29,549
scale operation where days and weeks

42
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,770
difference can make a large end product

43
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,990
difference so reducing that time as much

44
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,578
as possible through the use of mother

45
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,728
plants and clones is one way to

46
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,929
accomplish that to maintain that mother

47
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:41,938
plant the goal is to keep the mother

48
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,200
plant in a vegetative phase with just

49
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,959
enough nitrogen to allow for ease

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,450
including process and then by a short

51
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,149
duration to route if you overfeed them

52
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,040
with nitrogen the time to root will be

53
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,259
greatly increased and that can offset

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,210
schedules and also make a difficult

55
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,189
following process with a weak root

56
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,679
system this is why you want to keep them

57
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:03,978
healthy and properly fed but not overly

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,979
fed
