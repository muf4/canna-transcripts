1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
okay here I'm gonna go over different

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,190
types of bone fractures that either you

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,648
may have experienced or no sadly no a

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,019
friend has experienced now someone may

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,000
say they fractured their bone well

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,298
there's a lot of different types of

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,769
fractures and if you've know someone

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:18,539
that has a fracture may be able to ask

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,179
them more specifically what fracture

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,910
that they have or if they describe how

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,460
their bone was broken you may be able to

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,768
identify exactly what type of fracture

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,410
they have after the completion of this

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,780
video lecture so starting with bone

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,520
fractures in general brown patch here is

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,799
simply a breaking a bone now there's

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,500
different types of fractures two main

18
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,199
classifications are closed or simple

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,289
fractures and these are breaks in the

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,609
bone that do not penetrate the skin

21
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,770
another type is called an open or

22
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,689
compound fracture this is where the

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,270
broken bone penetrate through the skin

24
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,909
and do not worry I won't show any images

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,829
of this one in particular bone fractures

26
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:01,409
are treated by reduction and in

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,170
mobilization and this allows the

28
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,000
realignment of the bone now the period

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,280
of time that someone may stay in a cast

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,040
could depend on the type of fracture

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,260
that they have and also the age of the

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,320
individual and impact the duration that

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,590
they keep this hard cast on to allow for

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,129
that realignment to take place now some

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,478
different types of common fractures here

36
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:27,478
commutated one is where the bone

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,879
fragments into three or more pieces this

38
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,099
is commonly in the elderly the elderly

39
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,560
to have more brittle bones and as a

40
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,478
result they tend to split more into more

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
pieces now what I've tried to do with

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,650
each of these to provide a picture to

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,840
kind of help you remember what type of

44
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,820
fracture is occurring it with the bones

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,159
and hopefully they find them a little

46
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,109
bit helpful another type of fracture is

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,310
called a compression fracture bonus

48
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,890
crushed like the strong metal weight of

49
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,920
the hammer here it's common in phones

50
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,379
that are very porous the vertebral

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,359
column our vertebrae are very porous and

52
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,640
as a result they are subject to being

53
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,939
crushed a little hard to see on the

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,580
x-ray we can see this vertebral column

55
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,560
is a vertebra in this vertical column is

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,950
definitely crushed or smaller not quite

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,860
as

58
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:19,169
as the one below it against be very

59
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,490
painful but these porous bones are

60
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:24,389
subject to compression type fractures

61
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,250
addition to that we also have us a

62
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,889
spiral which is a ragged break when the

63
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,840
bone is excessively twisted common in

64
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,458
sports injury of that have stopped and

65
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,950
pivot and get that twisting action

66
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,610
that's occurring I can cause a fracture

67
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:41,789
here of the bone shown by the rope here

68
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,510
the esophageal which is the Ephesus

69
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:47,429
separates from the diathesis along the

70
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:50,459
esophageal line this occurs where

71
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,370
cartilage cells are dying

72
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,469
you can see an image here again not very

73
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,689
pleasant even on the x-ray as you can

74
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:00,239
see the reason why it tends to occur

75
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,969
here is this is where the calcification

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,400
tends to occur this matrix is occurring

77
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,349
and that growth plate is located in this

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,849
region we'd have the picture of the

79
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,789
chainsaw cutting as we have that kind of

80
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:14,579
that almost a clear and distinctive

81
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:16,949
separation amongst the bones here at

82
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,230
that plate there so again not a very

83
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:20,399
pleasant experience that's kind of

84
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:23,849
what's happening with this type of

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,129
fracture other types of fractures we

86
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,959
have a depressed fracture which is

87
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,719
broken bone portion is pressed inward

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,879
typical skull fracture it can be very

89
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,579
dangerous especially with pressure on

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,129
the brain or potential for bleeding but

91
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,379
this depressed fracture like the Apple

92
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,780
in the VCR is where the broken portion

93
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,659
of the bone is being pushed inward in

94
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,640
this case the other one here is called

95
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,560
greenstick this is an incomplete

96
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,708
fracture or one side of the bone breaks

97
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,780
in the other side bends very common in

98
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,569
children because they'd have more

99
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,599
flexible bones than those of adults rita

100
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,359
cults greenstick is it's refers to kind

101
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,459
of a green twig of a tree tends to have

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,890
this kind of break see it's pictured

103
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,049
here this is in the winter tends to be a

104
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,358
little more common in the winter where

105
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,310
we may have a snow load we see here we

106
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,168
have a one side of the bone breaking

107
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,199
inside the wood portion of the trunk

108
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,788
breaking and the other side bending miss

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,620
referred to as a green stick and more

110
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:25,978
common in children than adults who have

111
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,418
completely ossified bones putting those

112
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,719
common fractures together and a nice

113
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,029
kind

114
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,190
table here I can start to add a

115
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:33,569
comparison and can you if you saw a

116
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,550
picture of one could you identify it

117
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,680
they gave you the word of one could you

118
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,480
be able to draw a sketch or identify

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,550
what's going on if someone identifies

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,370
that they have for example a green stick

121
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,230
type of fracture so again review these

122
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,959
go back to some of the pictures and

123
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,640
hopefully find that helpful lastly I

124
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,569
want to go orders how the body repairs

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,240
it's a bone fracture which is important

126
00:04:53,569 --> 00:05:01,439
so this blood filled swelling is formed

127
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,170
initially hematoma so he needs referring

128
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,060
to blood tome is that blood filled

129
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,910
swelling is initially formed where that

130
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,709
fracture occurred the break is splinted

131
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,620
by fibrocartilage

132
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:16,769
on both the internal and external sides

133
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,079
to form a callus region then this

134
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:23,039
cartilage callus is replaced by a bony

135
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,930
callus slowly over time and this is why

136
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,110
we need to have our bones in a cast to

137
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,939
kind of hold everything in place

138
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,030
lastly the bone the bodhi callus is

139
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,579
remodeled to form a permanent patch now

140
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,079
almost the area where that initial break

141
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,699
or fracture occurred is actually a

142
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,089
little bit thicker than it was

143
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,649
originally so the body will actually

144
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:45,659
rebuild and repair that bone area

145
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:48,209
because it was an initial point of

146
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,770
weakness the bony callus is actually

147
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:52,199
going to make it slightly stronger in

148
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:54,599
that region however keep in mind that

149
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,360
you can break bone twice because if that

150
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,550
seam area is applied with the same

151
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,310
amount of force it was originally well

152
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,770
that initial site the fracture is

153
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,530
strengthened both regions on the other

154
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:10,799
side are now weaker in relation to that

155
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:12,569
same callus it formed so keep in mind we

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,490
want to try to avoid fractures but if

157
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,228
you do get one or know a friend or

158
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,269
someone that has one hopefully this

159
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:21,269
lecture helped you more appropriately

160
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:23,219
identify what is actually going on with

161
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,668
their particular bones and how they were

162
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,669
damaged
