1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,359
in this video at tobacco university

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,519
we're going to be looking at crime scene

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,318
overall processing protocol kind of that

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,638
overview

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,679
on how you go about processing a crime

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,439
scene

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,280
so starting with the investigation

8
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,959
investigation involves and always

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,320
involves that lecard's exchange

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,480
principle the fact that

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,679
something is always leaving that trace

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,000
and it's our goal

13
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,679
here as investigators to try to find

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,198
those trace evidence

15
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,800
keep in mind we don't want to overthink

16
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,279
things sometimes we want to use simple

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
logic to help direct our investigation

18
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,159
we want to use the scientific method

19
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,558
as well as far as going through the

20
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,279
problem-solving process and as always we

21
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,000
want to stay

22
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,879
organized organized so that we can refer

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,520
back to

24
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,718
notes refer back to diagrams photos

25
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
pictures

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
evidence collected so that we can find

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
answers

28
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,359
to questions that may be asked shortly

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
after or

30
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,119
a long term after the initial

31
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,039
investigation had taken place

32
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,519
we're looking at the diagram here just

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,439
kind of an example of problem solving

34
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
and if we give you the weights of these

35
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,599
objects in three different areas

36
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,478
can we calculate the weight kilograms of

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,599
the two cucumbers alone

38
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,519
so we're looking at forensic

39
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,280
investigation techniques

40
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,798
we want to look at recognition which is

41
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,478
that surveying the scene

42
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,960
document observations collecting

43
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,959
evidence then we have identification

44
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,478
which is the comparison to what is out

45
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,798
of the norm well it doesn't look

46
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,478
right then of our individualization

47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,360
which is the evaluate and interpret

48
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,239
process

49
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,679
and then the last we have the

50
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,559
reconstruction which is involving the

51
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
report

52
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
and presenting of findings to kind of

53
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,960
reconstruct what we think

54
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
may have occurred based on all of the

55
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,679
previous collection of evidence and

56
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,519
organization of that evidence

57
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,520
now how to go about this well step one

58
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,039
is interview i want to interview the

59
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,478
first officer at the scene

60
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,560
or the victim to determine what

61
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,478
allegedly might have happened

62
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,920
ask what the crime took place and how

63
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,159
the crime was committed

64
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,079
um no however this information may not

65
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,920
be factual but it's intended to provide

66
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,199
investigator a starting place

67
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
it doesn't mean just because you

68
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
interviewed someone who is there you

69
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,359
take their word as 100

70
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,280
correct but it does allow to provide you

71
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,280
a starting place

72
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,479
then you can lead that can help you lead

73
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,199
and help the

74
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,920
examination phase or identify possible

75
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,679
evidence

76
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,439
select a point of entry and a point of

77
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
exit develop a general layout of the

78
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,400
crime scene

79
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,318
so all these can be very important in an

80
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
examination process and again that first

81
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,238
step of that interview

82
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,959
can help you at least initially plan and

83
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,080
organize

84
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,159
how you're going to go about the

85
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
examination step

86
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,680
then we look at documentation so this is

87
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,599
very important you want to create

88
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,719
photographic records and a rough sketch

89
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,560
of the crime scene

90
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,239
identify the exact position of deceased

91
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,479
victim and other evidence within

92
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,640
the crime scene this can be a very time

93
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,280
consuming and tedious process

94
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,679
but it is vitally important not to keep

95
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,159
things

96
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
organized but to also ensure that

97
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,000
anything you collect

98
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,599
is also upholds in court as evidence

99
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,039
and lastly here we're looking at the

100
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,839
processing step

101
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,359
so this applies to both physical and

102
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,479
testimonial evidence

103
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
technicians are responsible for

104
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,000
identifying evaluating collecting

105
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,878
physical evidence from the crime scene

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,360
as this will be further analyzed in the

107
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,919
crime

108
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
scene laboratory so this processing

109
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,238
point so we're collecting some more of

110
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,560
that specific

111
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,640
data and we may not be doing this for

112
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,199
every piece of data collected but based

113
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,878
on

114
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,719
kind of what we think may have happened

115
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,039
or what kind of events we're looking at

116
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,878
that can help guide the process where

117
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,280
that time is going to be spent

118
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,560
as we're looking at kind of recreating

119
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,959
what may have occurred

120
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,959
at the particular crime scene we're

121
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,959
investigating
