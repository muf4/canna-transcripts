[Music]

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,600
situation

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,599
[Music]

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
all right let's compare some grow tents

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,359
you can get an idea which one will fit

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,039
your situation the best so first off

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,359
there's many grow tens out there

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,600
and for the comparison i decided here to

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,039
compare all grow tents of the four foot

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
by two foot size good

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,359
entry level fits in a lot of areas so

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,280
this is just the one i've chosen

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,719
to keep the size the same for all the

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,359
tents we're going to investigate

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
here on this buyer's guide so let's

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,119
start here with the convert the

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,718
two foot by four foot grow tent you can

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,759
see right here key features it does have

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,079
a metal frame

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,159
with reinforced corner connections the

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,239
advantages to this tent is as many

28
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,078
access ports with center viewing windows

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,679
we can clearly see right here

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
however the downfall is that it does

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,719
have one large door flap

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,478
that can be awkward compared to the

33
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,079
traditional centerline zippers

34
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,519
to try to access your plants which

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,719
you'll have to be doing hopefully

36
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,039
on a daily basis then there's the sun

37
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,920
big and easy that we can see indicated

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
right here

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
key feature is a large access door in

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,040
the back of the tent which

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
in addition to that large center zipper

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,118
we see here

43
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,158
the pros are that's a full 4x2 feet of

44
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,319
growing space

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,759
the downfall is its slightly larger

46
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,199
outside measurements can make going

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,000
through doorways a little bit more

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
challenging

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,438
so it does give you a two foot by four

50
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,719
foot growing area

51
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,798
so keep that in mind when looking at

52
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,000
dimensions measure your doorway measure

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,360
your closet and have an idea

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,519
not just what the growing space is what

55
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,319
the full outer dimensions are

56
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,920
to make sure it will fit in your area

57
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,199
then we get to some of the more common

58
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,960
uh brand names

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,719
brand name if you will the gorilla grow

60
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,158
tent this is the light line

61
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,679
and this has an optional height

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,359
extension for an additional cost but

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
that is kind of a key feature to this

64
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,280
line

65
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
it does have a full metal frame in

66
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,359
connections which are always great to

67
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
see

68
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,560
medium canvas density compared to others

69
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,599
in the grille tent lineup so it's kind

70
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,878
of like your entry

71
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,919
level type of material there but still

72
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,959
the guerrilla tent

73
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,359
name brand then we get to the uh

74
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,120
the shorty and this design for areas

75
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,040
with limited head space where you don't

76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,640
have a kind of a short ceiling full

77
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,560
metal framing connections again

78
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,159
traditional of our of the gorilla tents

79
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
we see here that's great

80
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,759
uh the cons though are the middle of the

81
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,359
pack in the gorilla lineup it's kind of

82
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,518
like not the entry level

83
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
it's also not their more expensive model

84
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,640
it's kind of that mid-level

85
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
so you're kind of getting not quite as

86
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,679
good as the top of the line but a little

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
bit of proof the lower lines kind of

88
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,800
caught in that middle there

89
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,280
that upper end one that kind of that top

90
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,879
of the line they say of the gorilla tent

91
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,479
would be the heavy duty one and that's

92
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,239
considered to be the kind of

93
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,000
highest strength and durability of the

94
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,439
gorilla line it does have that full

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
metal frame of connections as we've seen

96
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,000
throughout

97
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
however this is the most expensive

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
option so this is something that you're

99
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,280
really looking at can you justify some

100
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
of the options that it provides

101
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,759
justify that additional cost does it

102
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
offer advantages to you

103
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,359
of the strength and durability compared

104
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,399
to that light line we saw very first

105
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
again if you're just going to put a grow

106
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
tint in an area and just kind of take

107
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
plants in and out not a lot of

108
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,439
transitions back and forth not get a lot

109
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,519
of wear on the material

110
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,560
that light line may be sufficient or at

111
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,719
least offer a good

112
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,878
entry level there for you so hopefully

113
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,919
this kind of offered you some examples

114
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,679
of some grow tents you may have been

115
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,399
looking at may not have considered

116
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,680
so you can make an educated decision in

117
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,680
your purchase
