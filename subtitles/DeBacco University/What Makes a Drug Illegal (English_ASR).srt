00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,560
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,278
we're going to be looking at the

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,439
question what makes a drug illegal

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,879
you can see there's a whole host of

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,279
drugs here all

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,480
itemized over here on the right hand

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,800
side

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
just to kind of give you an idea of an

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
example

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,080
of about 16 different uh drugs

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,800
and what they look like associated here

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
but first we need to define what a drug

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
is and this is a drug

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
in general illegal or not so a drug by

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,079
definition is any chemical that affects

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
the human body or mind

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,359
when it's consumed in any way a

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,279
psychoactive drug

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,759
affects the brain and most of the laws

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
are against the psychoactive drugs

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,799
because of the alteration to mood and

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,079
behavior

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,640
or simply put brain function the illegal

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,119
drugs

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,439
in particular they are drugs in which a

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,839
person is not allowed to own or use

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,799
the law says a person cannot own a

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,800
controlled drug

29
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,320
without permission this is what

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,718
classifies or defines

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,000
an illegal drug getting into

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,920
prescription drugs compared to

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
over-the-counter drugs so we hear these

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,118
terms used quite a bit

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
so how do we define each of these

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,840
particular terms

37
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,000
well a prescription drugs are

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,079
pharmaceutical drugs that requires

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,359
a medical prescription to be legally

40
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,118
dispensed

41
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,879
so they're kind of there's a control

42
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,400
step in there

43
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,560
over the counter drugs can be obtained

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
without a prescription and the goal

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,960
is to control the potential for misuse

46
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,798
that's why there's prescription and then

47
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,759
called over-the-counter drugs

48
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
keep in mind though different

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
jurisdictions have different definitions

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,959
of what constitutes a prescription

51
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,799
drug the united states

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,078
code here looking at controlled

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,040
substances

54
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,599
the website located right over here

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,240
provides a list in our rating scale

56
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,280
called schedules the drugs potency

57
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,519
potential for abuse

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
likelihood of physical dependency and

59
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,959
medical implications

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,399
are all factored into the scheduling or

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,640
the level of scheduling

62
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
also this act establishes penalties for

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,959
offenses

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,320
and there'll be other videos that go

65
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,519
into this but this gives you that

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,159
general idea

67
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,280
of kind of what that classification is

68
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,120
for legal

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
and illegal drugs
