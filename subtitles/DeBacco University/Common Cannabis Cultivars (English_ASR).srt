1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
okay so here I'm gonna go have some

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:06,450
common cannabis cultivars and cultivars

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,969
we've become strange varieties cultivars

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,219
probably the best term to use is its

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,870
botanically correct there are some great

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,000
variability and you can see here just

7
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:18,989
morphology of these plants but there's

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,939
other differences so general a cultivar

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,219
overview well-well some highlights are

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,600
provided in some cases little is known

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,070
about the origin of some of the

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,740
cultivars I'm even going to present here

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,560
this shows the lack of definable

14
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,119
traceable family trees which is why

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,339
incorporating genetic testing is so

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,519
important going forward you can see here

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,960
on some very commonly varieties there's

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,940
not a lot of great background

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,308
information on them keep in mind also

20
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,320
that the use of the term cultivar is a

21
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:48,238
relatively new concept to cannabis but

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
it's botanically correct method and

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,280
should be used at increased rates of

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,009
adoption so there's so many to choose

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,719
from more breeders are not only

26
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,608
extremely plant material such as clones

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,439
but sharing what they produce this

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,210
increases the diversity of plants

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,489
available and part of the challenges to

30
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,109
have an accurate lineage records we know

31
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,380
where these plants came from or what

32
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:12,719
resulting cross they may be so general

33
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,030
classifications we can see our THC group

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,489
and our CBD group burning it to the CBD

35
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,810
group and explain a little bit of kind

36
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,420
of some of the issues with some of these

37
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,978
varieties in the THC group then I

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,320
provide some links to offer some other

39
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,030
information to kind of get some

40
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,118
background on on these in addition to

41
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,590
what I provide so first off THC

42
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,209
varieties these are strains that

43
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,030
produced a psychoactive high income

44
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:38,399
associated with marijuana these that are

45
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,170
high in THC are not the main focus of

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,810
this class we're going to focusing again

47
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,310
on that CBD hemp varieties however

48
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,829
there's come variety names that you may

49
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,170
recognize I want you to realize what is

50
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:53,959
actually classified as marijuana and

51
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:57,359
what is more of the hemp variety so sage

52
00:01:53,959 --> 00:02:00,478
sativa Afghan genetic equilibrium is a

53
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,759
high THC variety okayed by Adam Dunn is

54
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,629
considered to be the main staple of th

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:11,189
seeds contains over 20% THC so it's a

56
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:13,189
very potent strain again it's sa GE not

57
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:16,009
sage as in the

58
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,719
herb placed second in the 2001 cannabis

59
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,299
cup and more information presented here

60
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,810
this is with the sage plant and a kind

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,420
of relating to a herb look would look

62
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,580
like I'm not quite too similar to the

63
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,849
sage in the canvas variety but that's

64
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,440
again different derivative of that name

65
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:35,269
Blue Dream original California even

66
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,520
though the exact Creator is unknown so

67
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,409
we get into this variety too which again

68
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,150
hi teach you're not gonna focus on it in

69
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:44,030
general but it's want you to realize

70
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,800
here we don't know the exact creator has

71
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,930
become a West Coast legend and we still

72
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,230
don't even know who created it then for

73
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,300
potency and high production Sour Diesel

74
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:56,119
established itself McCann was seen in

75
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,219
early 90s with increased interest on the

76
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,439
East Coast in particular in the United

77
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,389
States the emergent by a girl who had a

78
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,849
sour demeanor has nothing to do with

79
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,769
this taste of the cultivar so again

80
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:08,030
sometimes these names can be misleading

81
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,719
and again even though this is in the

82
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,939
marijuana classification Sour Diesel

83
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,009
because the person was a sour person

84
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:19,750
pungent odor when growing typically

85
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:22,639
produces THC levels well above 20%

86
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,860
purple haze buds of shades of lavender

87
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,019
which is part of the name derive comes

88
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,440
from known for high energy created and

89
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,659
blissful effects made popular in 1967 by

90
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,459
Jimi Hendrix with a song Purple Haze and

91
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,680
yes it does have this kind of purple

92
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,020
coloration these anthocyanins are much

93
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,629
higher in Purple Haze and also THC is

94
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,100
high cush oh gee cush is one of most

95
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,039
popular and potent strains in the world

96
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,930
it's a broad category but and generally

97
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,389
can expect cush to have dense buds

98
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,900
rust-colored pistols see here that had a

99
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:56,359
brown coloration a lemon fuel skunk and

100
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,939
kind of spicy smell smooth for Bhatia's

101
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,400
flavor and sedative effects again also

102
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:03,379
high in THC

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,650
Girl Scout cookie are being abbreviated

104
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,539
now GS C short for Girl Scout cookie

105
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,730
which is a hybrid across between OG Kush

106
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,620
and urban poison little is known about

107
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:16,099
the origin other than its star in

108
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,750
California fairly recently 2011-2012 and

109
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,109
again this just points to the fact that

110
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,910
these names that become very popular

111
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:25,549
little is known about their origin so

112
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,120
this is increasingly kind of unknown and

113
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,030
the variability that we have even

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,399
some well-established well-accepted

115
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,009
variety names okay then we get to ones

116
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,319
that are low in THC these low THC

117
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,689
cultivars are ones that will not get you

118
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,519
high they don't produce very high

119
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,829
amounts of THC I'm not going to get to

120
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,620
in that psychoactive high they may be

121
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:49,469
considered low in THC often this is

122
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,569
considered to be below 5 percent THC but

123
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,780
keep in mind in order to be classified

124
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:57,750
as hemp the levels need to be less than

125
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:59,819
0.3 percent THC so some arguing that

126
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,129
federal maximum level of THC should be

127
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,310
around 1% as this will provide more

128
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:07,259
cultivars to be used medically and it's

129
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,800
still not produced the psychoactive high

130
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,120
so I have the picture of the limos here

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,129
simply because we're looking at where is

132
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,300
that bar where should that bar be placed

133
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:20,219
right now at 0.3% very low so that's

134
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,110
limiting the amount of cultivars these

135
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,289
next varieties I'm going to show are low

136
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,100
in THC cleaning there below usually

137
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:30,449
around that 5% but are not acceptable

138
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,520
from the federal standpoint so it would

139
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:36,900
still be classified as marijuana under

140
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:39,418
the current law so Kenna tonic a wild

141
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:42,779
high in CBD against the medical benefits

142
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:44,189
six to 17% there is still enough

143
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,348
teaching not to be considered as

144
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:48,689
cultivar as hemp typically has around

145
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:51,810
that six percent THC how it's still a

146
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,060
highly regarded medical cultivar and has

147
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,668
been used to treat pain in anxiety but

148
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,780
again still above that federal level

149
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:00,629
well above that federal level

150
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,459
despite its high CBD production so here

151
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,228
we're looking at a CDC in this cultivar

152
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,719
is derived actually from Kenneth tonic

153
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:08,038
there's a ratio of THC to CBD of about

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,620
one to 25

155
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,649
he's typically around half to one point

156
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,120
two percent THC which is so very low but

157
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,788
again still above that federal limit

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
this unique ratio induces little to no

159
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:22,560
intoxicating effects it can still have

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,689
the CBD percentage around 16 to 24

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,728
percent however typically tests just

162
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:28,560
above that threshold for was defined as

163
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:31,348
hemp so it's being replaced by

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,389
Charlotte's Web again a CDC we have the

165
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:35,668
band we have a CDC types of power

166
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,819
conversion also have some great links

167
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:40,649
located below here that's CBD varieties

168
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:44,939
Templar high CBD

169
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:48,448
and low THC which is low THC is defined

170
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,399
as less than 0.3 percent THC are the

171
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,720
main focus of this class well there are

172
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,839
many different varieties I have chosen

173
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,000
to highlight really just a few wife and

174
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,349
abacus are two examples varieties being

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,149
grown at UConn

176
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,650
so you see medical marijuana that we

177
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,209
find that slash through it it's kind of

178
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,909
a misleading statement because marijuana

179
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:08,519
is indicating of that high THC string

180
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,039
we're focusing here on CBD and hemp

181
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,469
varieties so Charlotte's Web is probably

182
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,939
one that gets the most attention its

183
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,220
biggest selling point is that it's

184
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,430
classified as hemp since it is less than

185
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,530
0.3 percent THC and also still remains

186
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,110
high in CBD has been shown to reduce

187
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:27,299
seizures without any mental side effects

188
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,910
its names actually derived from a young

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,680
girl on whose name is Charlotte who is

190
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,139
having epileptic seizures and that were

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,418
reduced with this cultivar which has a

192
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,069
web-like appearance so Charlotte and

193
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:40,139
Webb that's where it comes from

194
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,399
it's a relatively rare cultivar but is

195
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,259
highly sought-after in the medical

196
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,810
community leading to increased attention

197
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,788
and I have some great links here Dylan

198
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,019
the article about it and some more

199
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,430
information about Charlotte's Web if you

200
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,089
want to learn more so a variety here

201
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,400
we're growing at uconn is entitled white

202
00:07:53,089 --> 00:08:00,089
and this is a high CBD cultivar that's

203
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,069
high in CBD to THC ratio and the exact

204
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,019
genetics actually though do still remain

205
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,788
mainly unknown as far as a lineage edit

206
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,198
came from communities for chronic pain

207
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:08,038
and did with native effects from

208
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,900
chemotherapy

209
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:13,370
they said this is one of the varieties

210
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:13,370
being grown here at yuca
