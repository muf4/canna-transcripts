1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,269
here look at the animal phylum Porifera

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,799
or sponges now the reason why I have

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:10,199
this tenet down here and you'll see that

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,289
in some of the videos I put below the

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,779
name is kind of how to pronounce it RIF

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,969
or raw so I'll just kind of spelled out

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,189
the way kind of best put it down they're

8
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,140
not correct kind of English as far as

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,640
pronunciation goes but just gives you

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,439
that idea of how to properly pronounce

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,810
the phylum here and we're talking about

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
sponges here Porifera this is how they

13
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,709
look this might be kind of the most

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,149
famous sponge you might be familiar with

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,399
here but we're gonna be talking today

16
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,719
about the real sponges that live under

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,929
the water and not necessarily in

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,070
pineapples so this fund is animals

19
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,750
without tissues that's the key

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,219
indication here for what defines a

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,799
sponge that's one is our animals they're

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,719
not plants they're the simplest of

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,238
animals their bodies are a little more

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,429
than masses of specialized cells invade

25
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,198
an angelic matrix and the clumps of

26
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,149
cells disassociate from a sponge can

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,218
give rise to new sponges so how do we

28
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,469
get a new sponge from original sponge

29
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,019
well this clumps of cells kind of break

30
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,359
apart and they reattach to an area and

31
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,109
it can regenerate another sponge there

32
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,269
so again Rim the phylum here we're

33
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,010
looking at the diverse amount of sponges

34
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,868
that do occur so while some are

35
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,150
different colors and pretty fit some are

36
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:21,180
brightly colored some others are more of

37
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,780
a dull color and that's just associated

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,040
with that particular sponge variety what

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,049
is a sponge well and they'll have

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,329
tissues so the body of the sponge is

41
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,740
perforated with many little pores here

42
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:33,959
this is kind of a zoomed in version of

43
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,938
that sponge is a filter feeder which

44
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,709
traps any food particles that pass by

45
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,250
this is again a zoomed in version here

46
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:43,500
so as here micro villi being able to

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,780
kind of filter out water that's being

48
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,430
exchanged through the sponge this is

49
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,640
typically why there's this long kind of

50
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,990
tube like shape here Yves another

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,959
example just kind of have a look there

52
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,699
ain't a symmetrical they're asymmetrical

53
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,959
heterotrophic it has no cell walls so

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,799
you're gonna no cell walls again in the

55
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,349
case because we are talking about

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,479
animals and they do need to consume food

57
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,489
they're not making their own we see

58
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,550
indicated here our water in and water

59
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:11,370
out so they are exchanging water from

60
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,050
the outside environment here's a little

61
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,959
short video here about filtering barrel

62
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,180
of tuna sponges

63
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,459
and since I'm just another look here

64
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,310
we're seeing waters coming in and went

65
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:23,019
out the top and it's coming in all these

66
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,789
little hairlike the futures are kind of

67
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,829
out there they're kind of being used to

68
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:30,780
try to absorb or pick up food particles

69
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:33,579
that pass by this specialized cell type

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,259
see this is a little bit more of a

71
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,659
detailed version of zooming in here

72
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:40,688
where our water's being pulled into the

73
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:44,318
sides and it's being exited out the top

74
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:45,729
and as it's being pulled in again these

75
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,608
micro abilities all these little hairs

76
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:50,289
this high surface area is increasing the

77
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:53,409
odds that they come in contact with a

78
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:55,449
food particle that might be in the water

79
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:57,068
here that's brought in I'm not going to

80
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,888
go over all the names in the details

81
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:01,479
much another basics here we have our

82
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,030
specialized cell types even though the

83
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,009
tissues are present they're still taking

84
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,009
in water that contains food particles

85
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:11,590
are filtering that food out and ideally

86
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:13,929
the filter and water here is exiting out

87
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,340
the towel hopefully this gives you just

88
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,620
a little bit of an insight of how the

89
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,120
simplest of all the animals lives here

90
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,120
the basic sponge
