00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,240
going to take you outside we're going to

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,480
take a look at what different size

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,080
containers and the different size canvas

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,919
plants that they produced even on the

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,240
early stages because this is a question

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,839
i often get asked is what size container

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240
should i be growing in and outdoor

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,240
applications have different

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,759
parameters than indoor growing

11
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,919
operations so we're going to see a

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,279
comparison between the 10 gallon about a

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,519
40 gallon container as well so you can

14
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,759
see in the image here the larger pot is

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,519
definitely making a significant impact

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,359
there could be multitude of reasons for

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
that but for outdoor production you

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,878
might want to be thinking a little bit

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,959
bigger than information you might be

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,839
getting from indoor growers so let's go

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
outside and let's take a look to see

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,440
our different container sizes and how

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,440
our plants are performing outdoors

24
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,000
[Music]

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,119
so growers often want to know what size

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,719
container they should be growing their

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,320
plants in here we're in an outdoor

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,759
location and these plants were started

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,159
in small little

30
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,478
containers and then what size you pot

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
them up to and how much kind of

32
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,159
repotting do you go through and do here

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
in an outdoor growing location that

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,920
should be kept to a minimum and

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,159
basically transplanted right from this

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,079
size to whatever your final container is

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,080
going to be now here we see a little bit

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,719
of a comparison we have a 10 gallon

39
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,200
grow bags right here and then we have a

40
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,640
larger one located right here it's

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,400
probably a 35 gallon uh bag here and we

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
could see just the difference

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,200
in plant growth that that larger

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,118
area is causing there to be a larger

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
plant now this doesn't mean that just if

46
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,359
we get 100 gallon pot it'd be that much

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
larger the advantage to the larger bags

48
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,519
in this outdoor setting now it is quite

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,118
warm today these smaller containers

50
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,560
they're going to heat up a lot more

51
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,719
that's going to cause your root zone

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
temperature to become elevated you know

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,359
we're going to be approaching 90 degrees

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,840
fahrenheit here today if not higher

55
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,599
so as a result that soil temp is going

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
to get much higher indicating that root

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,959
zone temperature is going to get warmer

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,118
anything above 72 degrees fahrenheit

59
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,399
really is detrimental to root growth top

60
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,479
growth can handle that we want to keep

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,800
that root zone cooler this larger

62
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,280
container allows a greater buffering

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,200
capacity allows this to take longer time

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,439
to go through and heat up as a result

65
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,519
that cooler root zone temperature will

66
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,039
allow the plant to actually proliferate

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
much greater than if you get a really

68
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,919
really hot root zone temperature you

69
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,039
might see this with clones if you're

70
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,318
going through and done cloning with

71
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,759
particularly aeroponics and you get that

72
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,119
temperature too warm you're going to

73
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,840
have issues that's going to reduce or

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,840
[ __ ] your total rooting and increase

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,598
your rooting time so just keep that in

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,920
mind that sometimes larger bags are

77
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,238
better but it's not a linear scale there

78
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,318
is that theoretical maximum there that

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,719
plateau

80
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,439
as a result that 45 gallon pot for an

81
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,318
outdoor growing setup with a compost

82
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,519
base

83
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,199
with some manure added to it medium

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
looks like it's performing a lot better

85
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,439
even in the early stages which i would

86
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,439
expect to progress as the season

87
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,439
continues
