1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
if you wanted to learn more about

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,278
pre-rolls in the form that are made from

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:16,079
derived from cannabis

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:17,359
this tobacco university video is for you

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,198
all right let's go over cannabis

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,760
pre-rolls and

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,320
i'd like to thank uh ct pharma here they

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
provide

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
us some great information about some

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
products that they produce

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,960
it's also publicly available information

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
about their anal

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,200
in their analytical reports their labels

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
and products they produce

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
the descriptions and opinions and uses

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,320
of intended

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,160
to provide an understanding of some of

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,759
the end products of the cannabis plant

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,279
and here we're going to be looking at

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,119
pre-rolls so

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,640
just what is a pre-roll well it's

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,199
premium flour that's ground

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,480
and basically sifted to uniform size and

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,359
lightly packed into

25
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,359
an unbleached hemp paper cone is ready

26
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,799
to go easily accessible experience as we

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,519
can see pictured

28
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,198
right here inside there is basically

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
these buds that are just been

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,920
finely ground and sifted so it fits in

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
that nice neat little package

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
there are some options when it comes to

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,159
pre-rolls well they come in many

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
different sizes and counts

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,600
ct pharma just to focus on them for a

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,840
moment focus on two

37
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,640
they have uh their shorts and their

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
regulars

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
some dispensaries will offer pre-rolls

40
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,719
packed with concentrates such as live

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
resin

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,640
and rosin and a dry see

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,640
civ cannabis these are all available in

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,200
the same culivar as premium flower

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,200
because

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,478
that's pretty much what they are derived

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
from

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,920
so the use of pre-rolls just in general

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
when we're talking about pre-rolls

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,359
they get their name states they're

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,679
already rolled for the consumer which

52
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,519
allows for no additional preparation

53
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,840
and the imperials can be lit and smoked

54
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,519
for immediate on-the-go relief

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
the small price tag and quick use

56
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,039
imperials make them widely used

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,560
for trying out new cultivars

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
particularly these smaller

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,478
pre-rolls there if they want to try

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,439
something that offers a great quick and

61
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,239
easy

62
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,839
option for people now when we're looking

63
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,000
at dry flour in general

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,118
we want to be mindful of analytical

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,640
reports here

66
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,639
these are just some of the pages here

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,919
looking at our analytical reports

68
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,000
looking at some of the total yeast and

69
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,159
mold counts the microbial counts

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,598
the chloroform counts there are

71
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,560
necessarily tests that need to be

72
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,399
performed

73
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,759
so while again a lot of people focus on

74
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
the cannabinoids

75
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,679
and the terpenes for good reason we also

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,598
need to be mindful that

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,959
these products should have been tested

78
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,318
for and should have passed and should

79
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,159
have documentation

80
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,919
to match laboratory reports and lot

81
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,039
numbers with anything you're looking at

82
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,039
purchasing

83
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,560
now a lot of people look at the label

84
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,719
and of course it does say

85
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
all tests pass it does make it nice and

86
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,239
easy to view

87
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,519
but you can also or should be also

88
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,640
checking the

89
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,680
anal the analytical reports as well just

90
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,318
to confirm that

91
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,439
and have that area of documentation and

92
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,518
any good company

93
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,199
will have the label but also have the

94
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800
other paperwork to back up

95
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,799
their claims on the label
