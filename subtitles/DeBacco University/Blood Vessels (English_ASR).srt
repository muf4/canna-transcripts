1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,989
okay here we're gonna be looking at

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,000
blood vessels of the body the picture

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,108
here of some blood and also have

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,179
something that may initially seem

5
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:11,969
unrelated which is the Connecticut River

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,580
watershed on any watershed really for

7
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:17,278
example and what this is is we can make

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,170
connections between this and the blood

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,489
vessels in our own body and see how

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,160
there's some similarities and some

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,959
differences that do occur so getting

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,829
into classes of blood vessels there's

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,960
three main classes first cert arteries

14
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:34,079
and arterials there carry blood away

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,390
from the heart veins or venules carry

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,890
blood to the heart and in between our

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,960
arteries and our veins of this structure

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,600
here called the capillary and this

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,509
allows for extremes of nutrients wastes

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,429
and gases now typically as we see here

21
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,649
the arteries typically may be drawn in

22
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,140
red because they're carrying oxygenated

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,210
blood and veins are typically in blue

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,509
cuz they're carrying blood away from the

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,280
heart deoxygenated blood now even though

26
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:03,000
we may draw it like this and have nice

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,978
red and blue images our blood no matter

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,890
where it is in the body will be a shade

29
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,329
of red so don't think that your blood is

30
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,868
automatically turns blue and it's the

31
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,459
afternoon oh it's always a shade of red

32
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:16,829
continuing on focusing first on our

33
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,109
arteries these are a thick walled and

34
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,408
lined with smooth muscle remember this

35
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,359
is carrying blood away from the heart so

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,540
away from the heart arteries think away

37
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,609
the arterioles branch off from that the

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,618
expanders each heartbeat and contract a

39
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:34,560
flow afterwards which is what's helping

40
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,840
the blood move as blood comes from the

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,780
heart and large pulses the RT must be

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,490
able to expand as a result are really

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,519
made up of three walls you see one of

44
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:47,879
them here also where that smooth muscle

45
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,789
is located arterioles are small diameter

46
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,618
than our arteries they surround their

47
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,310
surrounding muscle air can be relaxed to

48
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,269
enlarge their diameter all of these

49
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,590
specific kind of details about the

50
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:03,539
artery help move blood from the heart

51
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,609
now arterioles as I mentioned they can

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,890
constrict to direct and control blood

53
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,770
flow they may for example increase blood

54
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,439
supply to the skin to allow more heat to

55
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,060
basically the

56
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,150
dispersed in the environment or

57
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,849
constrict during stress to redirect

58
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,849
blood to the heart and muscles so here's

59
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,840
our arterial example and that's leading

60
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:30,120
and getting closer to our capillaries

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,129
now our veins are venules which are a

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,560
small structure again on the other side

63
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,259
of the capillary they're thin walled and

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,870
they collect blood low pressure in these

65
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,239
manuals allows the capillary beds to

66
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,530
drain into them so again we have our

67
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,629
blood coming this way going through a

68
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,569
capillary first entering our thin walled

69
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,289
venule from there we're going into our

70
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,859
veins

71
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:55,169
so veins of thin thinner layers of

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,890
muscle and elastic fiber or walls and

73
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:01,349
their arteries when emptying they will

74
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,729
collapse so important a number of some

75
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,739
differences between our arteries and our

76
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,869
veins here contraction of skeletal

77
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,189
muscle helps move blood up the limbs and

78
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,379
back to the heart and also veins contain

79
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:15,419
valves which prevent plaque backflow of

80
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,120
blood so we see here our blood going

81
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,849
this way and to prevent the backflow of

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,129
that blood you see here that valve in

83
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,859
our veins closing up here so blood

84
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,750
cannot go backwards this helps move

85
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,440
blood get it back to the heart so it can

86
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,490
be recirculated throughout the body

87
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,109
Ahri's compared to advanced here's a

88
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,480
nice little direct comparison here

89
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,910
here's our example of our artery because

90
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,669
our example our vein and they said they

91
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:43,680
share the same internal features but the

92
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,179
walls of the arteries are much thicker

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,230
because of the higher pressure they have

94
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,760
to endure is a micrograph comparison

95
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,679
that shows the relative differences in

96
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,949
thickness it's a little harder to tell

97
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,020
in this image here but in the pictorial

98
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,479
here but their labeling it's very easy

99
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,640
to tell that much thinner appearance of

100
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,619
the vein compared to the artery it does

101
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,539
also exist here we have much thicker

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,300
artery than our being whose arteries

103
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,500
have to deal with the higher pressure

104
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,840
now with aliens and returning blood to

105
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,520
the heart preventing black flow these

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,590
presents of valves there's low pressure

107
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,889
in veins that's important to make note

108
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,959
of we also have skeletal muscles and you

109
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,459
need directional valves so as we see

110
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,379
here pushing moving the blood this way

111
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,120
the valve opens then you see the valve

112
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,089
closing

113
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,560
here preventing that back flow we also

114
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:32,149
see that here blood flowing this way and

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,379
then that valve closing preventing the

116
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:38,120
backflow see here muscles relaxing the

117
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,620
valve closes and then the muscle

118
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,199
contracts here now we're able to force

119
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,490
and move that blood through there might

120
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,250
be a little hard to tell on this graph

121
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,689
on this picture here but we could see

122
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,990
the names are located in this

123
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:53,120
distinctive region here capillaries so

124
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,939
this is in between the venules and the

125
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,680
arterioles these are body tissues that

126
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:00,500
contain a vast network of capillaries

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,019
capillaries themselves have very thin

128
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,538
walls and allow blood to pass it's only

129
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:07,099
one cell fit on cell thick and allowing

130
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:09,620
these blood vessels to travel through

131
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,750
here once all the time this allows the

132
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,060
exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide

133
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,610
and oxygen also nutrients and waste

134
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,199
through the process of diffusion so it's

135
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,840
important this does not active transport

136
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,280
but this is diffusion capillaries are so

137
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,649
fine that red blood cells must line up

138
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,418
single file to go through them so this

139
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:29,269
is what's allowing that maximum surface

140
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:31,189
area as well they get that kind of net

141
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,139
appearance to them there's our

142
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,660
filtration and again the movement of

143
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,360
carbon dioxide and oxygen nutrients and

144
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,169
waste is simply by the non energy

145
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,300
requiring diffusion process continuing

146
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,069
on the capillary network connects the

147
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,020
arteries and the veins individual

148
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,959
capillaries have high resistance to flow

149
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:52,759
but the total cross sectional areas of

150
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,199
capillaries is greater than those of the

151
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,250
arteries leading to it

152
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,930
so blood loss most of its pressure and

153
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,149
velocities it passes through this vast

154
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,590
capillary network so we have that high

155
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:05,060
pressure here coming from the heart

156
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,038
through our hey order through our

157
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,348
arteries but a lot of that's being lost

158
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,360
we have to squeeze those blood cells one

159
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:13,159
at a time through the capillaries before

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,038
returning to veins before going back to

161
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,539
the heart blood vessels there's a nice

162
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:18,379
comparison between our arteries and our

163
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:20,689
veins kind of putting everything

164
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,430
together showing that you that

165
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,978
comparison of how thick the areas are

166
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,199
which is how thin other veins are

167
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:29,509
doesn't mean they're necessarily

168
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,098
different diameters as we see here but

169
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,870
we've noticed also the presence of a

170
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:35,899
valve here in the veins

171
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,598
so veins think about arteries think away

172
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,949
from the heart lastly here's a couple of

173
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,449
major arteries and veins

174
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,529
get into these a little bit more detail

175
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:44,930
when we focusing down the heart

176
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,089
specifically to our femoral artery is

177
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,400
near our femur so you could see some of

178
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:51,919
the names here match that of the bones

179
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,839
of the skeleton that they're near keep

180
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,090
in mind our arteries are typically in

181
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,519
red veins are typically represented in

182
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,589
blue even though our blood no matter

183
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:03,279
where it's located her body is always a

184
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,279
shade of red
