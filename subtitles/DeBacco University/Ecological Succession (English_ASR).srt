1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,278
okay here okay ecological succession

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:09,269
what this is basically referring to is

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,490
if we look at the same block area it

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,460
will change over time what we're seeing

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,070
is initially starting with either a soil

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,900
based or a rock base and progressing to

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,689
some weedy species regressing to some

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,579
grass maybe some low-growing shrubs to

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,518
some big growing shrubs ultimately to

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,018
tall trees and it's this kind of

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,459
transition that occurs to form this

12
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,039
forest from something that was

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,070
originally barren is the process of

14
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,179
ecological succession so let's take this

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,280
a little bit more detail with the

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,019
definition of ecologic succession is

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,770
replacement of a one community by

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,719
another until a stable stage is reached

19
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,840
ecosystems do tend to change with time

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,939
until a stable system is formed this may

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,640
occur in a short period of time or

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,378
extremely long period of time the key

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,140
part here is over time we're

24
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,929
transitioning until a stable system is

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,960
formed this stable system will form

26
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:05,969
depending on the climatic limitations so

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,950
it doesn't mean that all ecosystems are

28
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,629
going to reach the same stable form that

29
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,780
stable form is going to be determined by

30
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:16,228
the climate in which geographic location

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,790
that we're talking about so the process

32
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,429
well.there involves three critical

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,680
concepts one is tolerance so we see the

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,509
picture here first come our we D R

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,360
selected species that are tolerant of

36
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,909
harsh abiotic conditions so see the

37
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,340
weeds always grow in areas regardless of

38
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,829
its good ears or bad years keeper here

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,359
is there are selected this are selected

40
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,728
if you remember they're produces lots of

41
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,680
offspring so very tolerant of a variety

42
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,118
of conditions because there's so many of

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,399
them and they have high degree of

44
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,438
genetic variability teeming on earth

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,140
facilitation this is where the habit

46
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,688
changes are introduced that favor

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,909
other less weedy species so we've gone

48
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,008
from just pure weeds to kind of in this

49
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,079
case development of some flower species

50
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,578
less weeding and getting more

51
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,529
established could see there's no barren

52
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,709
soil pictured here in the facilitation

53
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,118
step lastly here with inhibition habitat

54
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,669
change that may inhibit the growth of

55
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,139
the original species we have a tall tree

56
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,818
growing this tree is going to produce

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,919
large leaves they're going to shade out

58
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,208
other potential species

59
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,579
that were responsible for the

60
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,259
establishment of that area so as we

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,989
talked about when inhibition tall she

62
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:24,840
will inhibit maybe these tolerant

63
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:28,080
species herbs even these less weedy

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,689
species that started to develop now the

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,760
process of succession in ecosystem which

66
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,039
are more k-selected species remember

67
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,199
these produce less offspring replaced

68
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,840
the are selected ones so species

69
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,119
richness and total biomass increase how

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,879
our net productivity will decrease in

71
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,860
this instance thus our cultural systems

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,889
are maintained in early successional

73
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,840
stages to keep net high productivity so

74
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,059
was this kind of mean well by tilling an

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,280
area mono cropping meaning growing only

76
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,009
one crop in long rows we're actually

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,870
keeping this system in early succession

78
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,060
that a lot of room for establishment

79
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,030
here this is because this is very highly

80
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,340
productive at least when planted this K

81
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,469
selected species such as like large oak

82
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,750
trees or maple trees they're going to be

83
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,370
a little bit less than the productivity

84
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,840
but they're going to increase that

85
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,150
overall biomass a succession occurs

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,400
because we can see succession occurring

87
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,560
over a year so this climate model shows

88
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,340
the movement of the Midwestern Prairie

89
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,140
climate to the forest zone so it starts

90
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,090
at eighteen nineteen it estimates its

91
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,159
progression so you can see that this

92
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,530
area here is progressing its way

93
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,419
northward again there is a prediction

94
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,509
here this goes to all the way to twenty

95
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,328
ninety this is overall the progression

96
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:46,828
here is north

97
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,629
that's the courage each queenie changes

98
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:50,760
the conditions so they are more payable

99
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,430
for other organs that replace them so

100
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,229
this changing of conditions is this

101
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,180
favoring different organisms in that

102
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:58,828
environment for example some type of

103
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,109
tree seeing a lot of sun and their

104
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,120
saplings connect grow under the shade of

105
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,260
their own species this is an important

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,329
concept because trees don't want to

107
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,548
compete with their offspring so in this

108
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,859
case if the tree needs a lot of sun your

109
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,269
saplings connect row in your shade

110
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,969
indicating when they parent species is

111
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,709
there the parent specimen is there the

112
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,430
it will not be competing with its

113
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,129
offspring

114
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,500
lastly they will be replaced by types of

115
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,240
trees who saplings can grow under the

116
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,728
shade of other trees this is again

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,750
helping determine what species will be

118
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:31,289
living there

119
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,050
the succession will progress so took an

120
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,870
example here well we have an example of

121
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,520
a succession so primary succession

122
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,410
occurs where there is no previous

123
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,689
community such as bare rock less sand

124
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,020
primary succession begins with pioneer

125
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:48,660
organisms so this primary is referring

126
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,279
to bare rock or sand basically nothing

127
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,860
was there a lot of flow would be an

128
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,199
example of primary succession where this

129
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,379
newly exposed bare rock we're starting

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,089
at primary succession these private

131
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,519
orbitons can tell extreme conditions

132
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:04,199
extremely hot extremely cold Moss dune

133
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,729
grass and lichens are parting pioneer

134
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,159
organisms are some examples

135
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,410
soil is produced over 100 of years by

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,460
these pioneer organisms these organs

137
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:17,520
break apart rock and humus they can die

138
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:20,219
and decompose and old water these can

139
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,019
allow other organisms to grow so we see

140
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,850
this kind of old rocky Oasis of lichens

141
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,769
growing these are algae and are

142
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,930
cyanobacteria in a fungus growing

143
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,000
together in a mutualistic relationship

144
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,240
the algae make the food because they're

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,160
able to capture the sunlight and fungus

146
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,228
anchor and capture water so it's a

147
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,410
somatic relationship there there's

148
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:43,949
lichens as secondary succession is when

149
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:46,380
a community is disrupted and succession

150
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,889
occurs again so this disruption can be

151
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:52,110
from fire could be from farming from

152
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,819
forest and the key part here is the

153
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,590
community gives again we're form a

154
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,899
community was disrupted at our community

155
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,750
here being disrupted is being reformed

156
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,569
the key part for secondary succession is

157
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,800
the presence of soil so if soil is

158
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,800
already present and we see in these

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,840
three cases it is that is an example of

160
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,340
secondary succession remember primary

161
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,689
search is bare rock or sand now climax

162
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,359
community is the final stage of

163
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,879
succession these aim climax community

164
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,340
will develop unless a valley conditions

165
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,620
have changed 10x immediately part of the

166
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:29,099
biome of the area our climax community

167
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,139
in Connecticut here old hickory forest

168
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,419
which is part of the temperate deciduous

169
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,360
forest biome is considered a climax

170
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:40,228
community this is where old forces will

171
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,750
end up with a high presence of oak and

172
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:43,649
hickory trees

173
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,319
now Mooney is still undergoing

174
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:49,138
succession so we see the recent 1960s

175
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,580
and 1990s and then projected here we see

176
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,490
that there is this transition of this

177
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,089
increase in these oak hickory type of

178
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,519
forest

179
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:58,079
inclusion over the area snap shows the

180
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,668
current projected forest types major

181
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,560
changes are protected for many regions

182
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:04,438
and see the big difference here and

183
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,000
those maple beech and birch trees become

184
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,370
a little less predominant or at least as

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,848
its projected in the air 27 to the year

186
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,610
2100 as long as the species keeps

187
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:16,949
changing here the plants grown under

188
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,229
pine trees are not small pine trees so

189
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,419
the species will be changing with as old

190
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:24,180
time trees fall so we don't see the same

191
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:26,908
species under the original we are

192
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,439
noticing a change that's occurring we

193
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:31,168
see that here so exciting to me has been

194
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,168
reached when the community places itself

195
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:36,000
with more of itself what does that mean

196
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:38,490
well under sugar maple trees we'll see

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,689
more sugar maple tree saplings it's an

198
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,259
indication that we've reached the climax

199
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:45,539
community because the original specimen

200
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,028
is being replaced with the same type

201
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:49,408
we're not seeing different species under

202
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:52,319
there that will replace that in the

203
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:54,629
future and this is the conditions that

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,838
show a climax community which is the

205
00:07:54,629 --> 00:08:00,349
very end of ethological succession for a

206
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:00,348
given area
