1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,559
so here in this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
we're going to go over what a cannabis

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,669
clone is and also

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:15,759
what it is not

5
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:17,439
[Music]

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,199
let's go through and answer the question

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
what a cannabis clone is and what it is

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,320
not

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so first off what is a clone it's kind

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,079
of we hear them a lot

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
and they get this like mythical kind of

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,159
like connotation with them

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
a clone is simply a cutting from a stock

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,759
or mother plant

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,439
it's an asexual vegetative propagated

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,479
plant material so that's why they're so

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,878
called clones

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,640
instead of that long kind of terminology

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,718
there but that's actually botanically

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,878
what a clone is a clone is also

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
genetically the same as the original

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,960
plants that's why it's advantageous

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,359
we have unique individuals to go through

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,198
this cloning process

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,558
however what is a clone knot you know

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,399
when we're looking at a clone well a

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,839
clone is not a seedling

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,759
seedling here starts from the seed

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,960
develops cotyledons and it's kind of

30
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,478
that new emergence

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,478
your clone is that cutting asexual

32
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,959
vegetative propagation from an original

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,799
plant clones also will technically lack

34
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,798
that defined central tap root

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
that you see with seedlings they still

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,040
can produce an aggressive set of roots

37
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,239
but they will lack that central tap root

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
so it's important to realize that if

39
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,519
you're growing clones versus seedlings

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,519
you are not going to have that central

41
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,839
taproot with clones as you would if you

42
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,199
were starting with a young

43
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,799
seedling so why do growers like clones

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
they like them because it's guaranteed

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,960
or at least consistent genetics

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,879
and known gender of the plant so those

47
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,798
are two great aspects that are very

48
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,280
advantageous for growers to know

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,880
so they're not wasting their time with

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,399
potentially a seedling that might be a

51
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,319
male when they want a female

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,680
may not be a cross it might be new and

53
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,359
they wouldn't know what they're getting

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
so this is why growers really like

55
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,799
clones however for growers that like

56
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,640
clones

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,840
there's also what reasons why growers

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,118
don't like clones

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
so it's a reason why grower wouldn't

60
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,399
like a clone well it's a

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
challenge to plant you're not starting

62
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
with that small seedling you're dealing

63
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,039
with a

64
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,639
literally a plant there's also typically

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,679
increased cost per plant

66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,919
versus seeds so that can cause an

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,520
increase in upfront cost for growers

68
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,958
but a lot of growers feel that the

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,200
advantage that i mentioned

70
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,400
outweigh these potential downfalls but

71
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,799
this is why there are those

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
options to plant clones or start with

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
seedlings

74
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,040
the option is up to you to choose what

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,039
fits best for your situation
