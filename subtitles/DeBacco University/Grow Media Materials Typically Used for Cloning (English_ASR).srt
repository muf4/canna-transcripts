1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
the cloning process can require a

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,088
specialized set of tools and conditions

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:08,910
here we're going to focus on the growing

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,010
media's that are particularly used for

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,320
the cloning process we see two different

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,750
types of cloning setups here keep in

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,640
mind the one on the left here a little

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,710
bit dirtier and not quite keeping things

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,839
as clean as we should especially when

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,580
we're looking at the success of our

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,890
potential next run of plants our next

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,079
generation of plants here while we still

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,390
have potentially some things off in the

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,509
picture here a much cleaner setup in

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,679
this image here than in here and again

16
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,589
keep in mind we want to keep our clone

17
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,259
environment very clean to reduce the

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,480
chance of losing our entire crop so

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,280
first off a very common material use

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,140
that a lot of growers select is rockwool

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,200
this limits route disturbance during

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,570
transplant it can be expensive but in

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,300
moisture consisting at times can be an

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,850
issue as the cec or a cation exchange

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,000
capacity of zero so plants need to be

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,609
out of continuous liquid feed also this

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,588
material has no buffering capacity so

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,689
the grower has to keep that in mind I've

29
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,340
watched the pH of the solution that it's

30
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,169
that they're feeding their plants

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,510
now which one says it's route

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,670
disturbance is there is Rockwell

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,830
companies that make smaller cubes that

34
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,349
can start the initial root development

35
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,319
and then easily be transplanted into

36
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,539
larger cubes here easily fitting into

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,279
place this limits the root disturbance

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,520
going from one size or directly to

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,070
another not requiring any disturbance of

40
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,019
the roots initially there there's also a

41
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,298
peat pellets these are an economical

42
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,158
option and they give roots an area to

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,680
fill in they need to be monitored for

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,850
even inconsistent moisture it can be a

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,770
little bit of an issue especially

46
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,709
starting out I won't see it everything

47
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,739
evenly moist you put the clones in there

48
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:52,259
and just monitoring them so one doesn't

49
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,959
dry out more so than another to keep

50
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,149
that clone going well at the early

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,559
stages and continuing on keep those

52
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,239
roots going there's also expanding

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,430
expanded clay pellets these are clay

54
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,589
pieces that are processed in very high

55
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,009
temperatures create these little pebbles

56
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,439
here

57
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,779
they contain large and small pores allow

58
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,770
for air exchange this should be rinsed

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,599
and soaked before used

60
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,640
remove any of the dust that comes in the

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,650
shipping container you do not want to

62
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,449
let these dry out during any part of the

63
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,670
growth cycle I'm going to keep moisture

64
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,310
at all times because once they dry out

65
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:28,139
they can be difficult to re-wet and be

66
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,840
moistened and that could severely stress

67
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:34,049
the newly developing roots of our plant

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,270
here also have foam or oasis blocks

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,420
Oasis is the name brand they're good for

70
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,340
plant support they do require a

71
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:43,319
submission time to pre-soak they can be

72
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,990
expensive and they will always leave

73
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,849
this like oasis dust around they're

74
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,430
typically using floral arrangements here

75
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,159
because they're great at allowing of

76
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,710
supporting of plant stems that sometimes

77
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,810
are called that floral foam also good if

78
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,270
keep even moisture to be used for

79
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,400
propagation process though not commonly

80
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,570
used a lot

81
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,569
there's sand and this provides good

82
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,909
porosity gives roots good aeration it

83
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,729
can be messy it's a heavy material even

84
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,079
when it's dry it's hard to be ship you

85
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,019
know it comes in to pick we would call

86
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,240
sandbags to make it easy to transport

87
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,400
routes can be easily disturb though

88
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,790
because the sand itself will not hold

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,709
much structure to it so while this have

90
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:28,019
some advantage of allowing good aeration

91
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,490
and also have awesome drawbacks there

92
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,969
especially you got to remove a lot of

93
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,930
the plants to go to the next container

94
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:35,370
sterilizing or growing media so this

95
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,219
should be considered for fixed grain

96
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,530
media such as clay or sand or even if

97
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:43,199
you're considering using soil there's

98
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,550
chemical sterilization which

99
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,929
incorporating carbon peroxide or

100
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,060
chlorine based products to kill

101
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,490
organisms heat sticks or steam

102
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,750
sterilization is also recommended but

103
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,810
this can be a challenge to get even

104
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,699
distribution as you can see in this high

105
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,740
tunnel situation using a steam generator

106
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,289
here under a tarp it kind of steam

107
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,719
sterilize at least the surface here also

108
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:06,569
they make these complex machines that

109
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,000
have all these little basically pipes

110
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,870
that poke into the soil and inject steam

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,759
that way however these are not advised

112
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,358
for professional operations you simply

113
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,439
would just buy new there's me a lot of

114
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,479
investment into steam and it can only

115
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,250
sterilize a certain portion that's why

116
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,319
starting with a sterilized me to begin

117
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,610
with can help you avoid this process and

118
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,668
ensure your starting clean every time

119
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,669
you
