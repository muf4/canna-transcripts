1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,939
okay here we're gonna discuss season

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,460
extensions always to get a little bit

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,039
longer growing season there's many

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,150
different styles many different purposes

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,500
you could see just because you have a

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,870
structure doesn't mean you can't have

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,868
the structure within a structure tall

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,948
crops long crops all different styles so

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:21,300
I'm going to touch on just the main

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,150
points here just to give you an idea

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,550
what's available so first off for season

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,768
extensions there's small styles they can

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,689
adjust rows they are used to help

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:34,229
protect very small plantings here not

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,570
very tall low in a tight area areas you

16
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,769
might be switching or changing excellent

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,350
for that purpose still getting the

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,079
benefits of added heat and reduced

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,090
frost potential for damage but not

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,460
having to set up a very large or

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,140
elaborate structure and there's your

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,020
mid-sized caterpillar tunnels for

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,549
gaining massive popularity great if

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,050
you're considering the high tunnel but

25
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,858
are unsure if you want to commit to one

26
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:00,929
easy to set up I've set them up I really

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,989
don't take all that much time a little

28
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,629
prep work a little yes there's some

29
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:09,959
bolting and some measuring to do but

30
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,129
overall easily done in a weekend and

31
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,408
they say they said the great you're

32
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,688
considering a height Ã©lber not 100% sure

33
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,939
we're committed to that and you can set

34
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:19,618
multiple up and they give you an idea of

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,089
what it is like growing in a protective

36
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:22,618
structure and some of the benefits

37
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,750
that's what some of the challenges in

38
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:28,259
growing then caliper toes relatively

39
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,390
inexpensive not very wide but long great

40
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,310
for long areas of fields and as I said

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,710
instead of just committing yourself to

42
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,570
one you could easily do two and offers a

43
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,578
lot of flexibility that you're also

44
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:42,029
pretty easy to move if you wanted to do

45
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:44,339
crop rotations which is advised larger

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,040
styles is your true high tunnels do the

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,810
grants have become very popular

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,060
springing up all over the place if you

49
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,829
get more than one though I tried it to

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,868
the same size it makes it a lot easier

51
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,609
for management purposes they have

52
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,649
advantages but need to be taken care of

53
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,828
the plastic should be removed during the

54
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,540
winter and or the structure should be

55
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,250
able to be moved and it should be moved

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,560
it shouldn't be a permanent structure in

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,000
one solid location should have the

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,739
option of being moved

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,439
the reason being is you leaving that one

60
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,770
area can leave to the build-up of

61
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,020
nutrient

62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,510
I don't get a lot of leaching I can also

63
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,700
have pest issues and problems so this is

64
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,929
why these aren't greenhouses they're

65
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,409
called high tunnels because they're able

66
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,090
to be moved so high tones versus a

67
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,120
greenhouse well high tones are temporary

68
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,349
they don't have an extra heat source so

69
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,750
you can see here they're just literally

70
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,250
tunnels that are tall greenhouses are

71
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,280
more permanent structures they can get

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,750
paved and solid floors high degree of

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,300
climate control heaters coolers sauce

74
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,030
fans a lot of electricity enough hanging

75
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,709
lights a lot more of a permanent

76
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,060
structures true high tunnels are just

77
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,099
that they're usually placed in fields

78
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,659
and there are tunnels that are high and

79
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,719
they're just aiding an extended net

80
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,280
growing season a very important part

81
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,979
where they have a small one a midsize or

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,379
a large one or even a greenhouse is

83
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:06,988
keeping these structure clean inside and

84
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,519
out is extremely important this can

85
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,289
often be overlooked especially when

86
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,810
they're brand new they look very nice

87
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:15,329
and they are but you got to maintain

88
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,729
that reduce the potential for disease

89
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,260
carryover it is the number one reason we

90
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:22,379
want to limit your local pest pressure

91
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,849
clean it sweeping up the floors making

92
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,560
sure there's not a lot of residue don't

93
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,840
using this storage for certain things

94
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,150
that letting crops die in there and then

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,610
just leaving them going through washing

96
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,890
the plastic even as you take it down the

97
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,890
inside the outside it's very important

98
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,018
to keep them clean in and out this is an

99
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,298
example of a relatively good size high

100
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,099
tunnel here showing you what it can look

101
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,439
like any season nice and clean here I

102
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,549
want to visit this farm it's the only

103
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,620
here a couple clippings here they're

104
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,409
doing some pruning but how clean it is

105
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,950
top bottom and plants they don't want to

106
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:59,909
have a micro environment here that can

107
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:02,339
increase your own pressure of pests

108
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,590
lastly extending your season you extend

109
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,450
it early as in the March April May time

110
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,909
frame or late September October November

111
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:11,219
it mage's early is that you can get a

112
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,680
jump on the season often get ahead of

113
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,180
pest pressure which is great late in the

114
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,590
season you can continue to Thanksgiving

115
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,739
meal if you're delivering that for

116
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,449
someone or the pests pressure can be

117
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,639
higher though later in the season so

118
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,620
just a word of caution that's starting a

119
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,620
little bit later in maintaining them

120
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,360
keeping them

121
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,879
for especially late season crops is

122
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,040
important ruin the season you need ten

123
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,449
that that has many problems but still

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,879
almost well I'll keep it cleaned and so

125
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,349
you don't have any issues and pushing

126
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,659
that season early and late can be great

127
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,110
hmm what if he do says your offseason so

128
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,110
keep that in mind
