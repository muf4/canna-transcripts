1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
here we look at different tomato

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,209
varieties it see just in these three

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,130
containers here some of the large

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,440
differences just need color that we can

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,889
get but also shape we're looking at

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,660
Tomatoes now when we're trying to read

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,038
about them it seems like they're always

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,559
the best

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,350
every tomato is like the one that's

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,429
gonna completely south world hunger

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,439
there's many different varieties to

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,300
consider but remember that the

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,278
descriptions you're reading will

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,189
typically only contain the positives

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,539
about that tomato everything once it

16
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,969
seemed like it's the maximum amount of

17
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:39,479
stars or ratings I kind of got a read

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,489
through and figure out what they're

19
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,429
saying is gonna be the most positive

20
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,899
aspects about that maybe there's other

21
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:49,019
things that might be more negative with

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,359
that so first off tomatoes based on size

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,949
so they're typically organized by on the

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,469
size of the tomato they will produce

25
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,939
this can dictate by the market what is

26
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,399
your consumer want do you want to be

27
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,920
growing small cherries one of the larger

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,539
ones mid size what does the customer

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,890
want because that's going to drive what

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,219
you're going to need to choose and

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,799
select to grow now what I look for in a

32
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,390
tomato sees is disease resistance so

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,650
there's a lot of different catalogs an

34
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,750
awful lot of different abbreviations

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,759
these are some of the major ones here

36
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,430
the whole point of having increased

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,530
disease resistance is to reduce the

38
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,470
amount of spring or kind of a lot of

39
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,549
tomatoes to kind of fend for themselves

40
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:28,009
especially if you have an area where you

41
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,740
have a lot of pressure from something

42
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:33,599
could be for example late blight is kind

43
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,868
of a major concern early blight can be

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,158
another one something to consider

45
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:40,290
typically you'll pay more for seeds that

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,659
have disease resistance but in my

47
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,530
opinion that's a small cost to pay for

48
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,689
the in season benefits there's also this

49
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,070
grafted Tomatoes kind of come up here

50
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:51,898
well remember there's a rootstock

51
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,969
there's a bottom portion here that

52
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,909
offers disease resistance they're just

53
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,950
sky there's a top portion that usually

54
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,079
produces a great tasting tomato then

55
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,210
there's a grass Union and this is the

56
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,519
little area here to please kind of swell

57
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:08,519
up this needs to be placed in air or

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,189
above the soil line by at least a few

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,530
inches to prevent routing from coming

60
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,770
from the sky under the top portion to

61
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,319
kind

62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,630
negate the effects of that rootstock to

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,189
sky on portion so again remember when

64
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,680
you're painting crafted Tomatoes they

65
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,840
can be a great way to kind of get

66
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,969
disease resistance also but keep that

67
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,129
graft Union well above this soil line

68
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,379
now you'll notice that loons tomato

69
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,719
variety lecture that I did not mention

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,219
any specific varieties reason why I

71
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,590
didn't is they're constantly changing

72
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,210
and you have to find what works best for

73
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,490
your particular area

74
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,010
I think the key part here is yet disease

75
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,050
resistance and also considering grafted

76
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,609
tomato as an option but make sure you

77
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,910
keep that graft Union above the soil

78
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,910
line
