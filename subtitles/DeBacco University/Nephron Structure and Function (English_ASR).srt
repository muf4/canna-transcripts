1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,299
so here we're going to look at the

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,969
distinctive structure and function of

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,699
the nephron which is located in the

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:11,460
kidney and there are many over a million

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:15,119
nephrons for each kidney which is

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,618
important for the filtration of blood so

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,480
looking at that blood in the kidney well

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,118
how's it going through only this intense

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,510
network of capillaries and we have our

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:27,839
veins in our arteries here surrounding

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,699
our nephron these nephrons here outlets

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,920
allowing a lot of nutrients and water

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,329
and ions to be exchanged and that's how

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
we see Sunnis blood vessels surrounding

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,070
each one of these each nephron has this

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,189
very distinctive structure I'm going to

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,539
go over the details of that so look at

18
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:43,049
the nephrons are the functional units of

19
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,878
the kidney

20
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:46,769
they cleanse the blood and balance the

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,649
constitutes for circulation they're

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,390
constantly filtering out the blood they

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,058
take simple filtrate of blood and modify

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,640
ultimately into forming urine and they

25
00:00:54,058 --> 00:01:00,780
say there's 1.3 million nephrons per

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,359
each TD that you have so that blood flow

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,670
through these intense capillary beds we

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,099
have our arteries and our veins going

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,868
through our venules we see all these

30
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,789
little blood vessels surrounding kind of

31
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,280
this kind of looks like a bunch of tubes

32
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,320
kind of folding on one another this is

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,379
important we have a lot of exchanges

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,298
occurring at these distinct exceptions

35
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:23,009
ultimately we're producing urine at the

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,670
very end and that will be excreted from

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,739
the body the anatomy of the nephron here

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,228
giving a nice quick summary the globe

39
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,298
Eris's filters on small solute sweet

40
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,578
blood that then leads to the proximal

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,040
convoluted tubule the PCT

42
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,559
where ions may be absorbed water can be

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,210
reabsorbed but also nutrients toxins

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,670
will be removed and we'll adjust the

45
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,849
filtrate pH to maintain our proper

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,500
homeostasis continuing on you see it

47
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,478
kind of bends around the corner comes

48
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,909
around here we have the descending loop

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,618
of Henle aquaporins allow water to pass

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,140
from the filtrate into the interstitial

51
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,328
fluid in contrast we do 180-degree

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,810
hairpin turn coming back up the ACE in

53
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:06,269
the loop where were absorbing sodium

54
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,459
ions and chloride ions from the filtrate

55
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,288
to the interstitial fluid that's leading

56
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,759
to the distal tubular which is

57
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,469
selectively secreting and absorbing

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,389
different ions Symington

59
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,639
electric balance this is part of that

60
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,349
homeostasis so we don't know if we're

61
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,079
secreting or absorbing it depending on

62
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,659
the constraints or the stresses on the

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,940
body ultimately the collecting duct

64
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,270
which reabsorb solutes in water to form

65
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:34,680
the filtrate now the physiology of the

66
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,300
nephron are saying this arterioles when

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,980
we see these veins we see this

68
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,540
filtration that's occurring in the

69
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,419
Bowman's capsule

70
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,250
lemare's capillaries located here we

71
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,009
have filtration reabsorption secretion

72
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,870
ultimately excretion in the form of

73
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,370
urine in the body this gives you a

74
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,340
little bit of an idea of the complexity

75
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,879
of what's going on each neuron nephron

76
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,770
I'm sorry

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,259
and we noticed that there's different

78
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,450
ions that's occurring here now these

79
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,579
ions are either coming in they can be

80
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:06,389
going out this is helping the body

81
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,830
maintain homeostasis so these nephrons

82
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,529
need to be in direct contact with the

83
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,840
blood now this might seem a little

84
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,520
complex right now that will admit that

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,409
the easiest to follow is to initially

86
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,120
but I provide this with you at the end

87
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,579
but I want to draw your attention to at

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,360
this point is we have these distinctive

89
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,340
sections here the filtration step we

90
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,110
have the PCT the proximal cuddler to

91
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,700
build and lay the distal in the

92
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,010
collecting duct we're gonna go over

93
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,009
these each in detail in image it's

94
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,329
probably a little less scary here

95
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:39,840
showing you the same region stretching

96
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,160
out that nephron a little bit so we have

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
that filtration that selective

98
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,379
reabsorption the osmoregulation insult

99
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,048
radiance selective reabsorption and then

100
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,609
water retention at the very end it's a

101
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,590
little stretched out to kind of give you

102
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,510
the idea of what it looks like it is

103
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,739
much more condensed as you're trying to

104
00:03:54,509 --> 00:04:00,959
fit 1.3 million in each kidney so start

105
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,480
with the clematis the only place where

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,489
actually the filtration occurs blood

107
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,259
pressure is used to push plasma through

108
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,840
the capillary walls to the Bowman's

109
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,489
capsule here this is our actual put of

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,979
filtration the blue mass is in red and

111
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,500
the Bowman's capsule here in hand we're

112
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,659
forcing that blood plasma across causing

113
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,228
that kind of physical type of filtration

114
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,210
to occur that then leads to the PCT or

115
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,519
proximal convoluted tubule where our

116
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,329
nutrients and our salts some vitamins

117
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,370
and water can

118
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,438
moved out of the tubule through active

119
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,840
transport so this does require energy

120
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,460
however from water right using that

121
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,508
through active transport that occurs by

122
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,718
osmosis

123
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:42,240
we can also reabsorb seven sodium's

124
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:45,769
nutrients urea lipid soluble silence and

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,110
small proteins now proximal tubules

126
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:50,240
continuing on we have our loop of Henle

127
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,530
remember there's two parts to this

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,379
consist of was the descending which is

129
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:58,138
important for water flow and in a

130
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,060
setting which is a transfer of ions we

131
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,430
see that here here's our sodium and

132
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,009
chloride ions tissue surround loop of

133
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,199
Henle is salty from active transport and

134
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,968
diffusion of these chloride ions the

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,069
salty conditions allow water to diffuse

136
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:13,740
out of the loop so this is we're

137
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,569
creating that water and that ions into

138
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,968
the process of osmosis and regulation

139
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,189
this is how we're having that water to

140
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:22,408
move across active transport since

141
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:25,168
moving the ions and as Moses is moving

142
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:27,750
the water continuing under the distal

143
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:30,149
tubule here it's a selectively secretes

144
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,829
or absorbs ions to maintain blood pH in

145
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:34,228
the electrolyte balance these are that

146
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:36,149
homeostasis coming in so we can kind of

147
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:38,430
absorb or secrete them depending what

148
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,348
the body needs active transport is used

149
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,819
to move these nutrients out of the

150
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:43,528
concentrated urine that are slowly

151
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,658
getting very close to producing our end

152
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:47,338
product which is earrings some ions

153
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:49,860
drugs and toxins are actively pumped

154
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:52,348
into the tubule for excretion out of the

155
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,729
body you see this active transport

156
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:58,168
pictured here again that's requiring ATP

157
00:05:55,728 --> 00:06:00,449
continuing on that collecting duct more

158
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:02,848
water leaves it to be las voces since

159
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:05,009
the tube is around eyes salty tissue so

160
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:06,990
that salty tissue is driving that moving

161
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,419
water and that water is going to move in

162
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,310
that direction Cimmeria also leads by

163
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,978
diffusion but it may be cycled through

164
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,158
the system Maria it's less toxic than

165
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:19,500
ammonia so again here's that kind of

166
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:21,180
simple structure of the nephron looking

167
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,860
at the Bozeman's castle the proximal to

168
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,500
build a loop of Henle the distal tubules

169
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,848
and the collecting duct lastly they end

170
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,829
with that a little bit more complex

171
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:31,228
image hopefully you can kind of get an

172
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,699
appreciation for all the different

173
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:34,978
things occurring at the different steps

174
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,050
and where things might be moving in or

175
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:40,110
moving out to help the body maintain

176
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,920
homeostasis and ultimately produce urine

177
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,870
and kind

178
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,350
waste products so they'll be excreted

179
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,350
from the body
