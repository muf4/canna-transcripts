1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
here i'll be doing my best to provide

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,679
you an overview

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,040
of the photosynthetic processes we see

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,638
pictured here

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,559
a lot of times it's abbreviated capital

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,199
p lowercase s if you see that that

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,399
stands for

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,879
photosynthesis now the basic overview

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,560
is taking in plants taking solar energy

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,399
carbon dioxide and water to produce

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,759
energy storing carbohydrates in the form

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,159
typically of sugars

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
oxygen is generated as a byproduct and a

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,960
waste product for plants which is a good

15
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,640
thing for us animals

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
because we need that to breathe to go

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
through our cellular respiration

18
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,600
process and the water is absorbed

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,879
through the roots of the plant and is

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
transpired through

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
throughout the plant there to help move

22
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,199
water keep everything hydrated high

23
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
tucker pressure

24
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
and also remove nutrients now looking at

25
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,960
photosynthesis on a macro

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
and micro scale not all cells within a

27
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,399
plant

28
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
carry out or have all the components to

29
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,439
carry out

30
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,878
photosynthesis cells in the middle layer

31
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,878
of the leaf have the chloroplasts which

32
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,439
contain the photosynthetic apparatus

33
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,839
we see that here the dark green region

34
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,920
look towards the top that's the cuticle

35
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
and that's a waxy protective layer this

36
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
dark green section here is where the

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,840
photosynthesis

38
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
will be occurring at the highest rate

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
now within

40
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,159
the photosynthesis it's a very complex

41
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,959
sequence of steps in short though it's

42
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
conversion of

43
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,280
light energy into chemical energy so it

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
takes place in two stages we have the

45
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,759
light

46
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
dependent reaction and then we have the

47
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,400
calvin cycle or the light independent

48
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,719
reaction

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,478
the light dependent reaction is takes

50
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,920
place in the thylakoid membrane uses

51
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,959
light as the name implies

52
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,560
it's generating atp and nadph

53
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,000
those energy molecules are going to the

54
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,519
calvin cycle

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,118
which takes place physically in the

56
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,719
plant within the stroma

57
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,959
and it uses energy derived from these

58
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,920
compounds to make

59
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,319
3p ultimately will be made into sugars

60
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
from

61
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,359
the carbon in carbon dioxide now the

62
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
equation for photosynthesis which you

63
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,879
might be familiar with

64
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,798
is carbon dioxide plus water and

65
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,359
sunlight producing sugars and

66
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
oxygen now it takes six carbon dioxide

67
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,679
six water molecules light energy to

68
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,479
produce one

69
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
sugar or glucose molecule and six oxygen

70
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,318
molecules

71
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,919
uh it's this it's kind of deceptively

72
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,318
kind of simple when you look at it this

73
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,839
way

74
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,519
but there's a very complex sequence of

75
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,039
steps that derive this

76
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
uh this is requires a lot of

77
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,519
intermediate reactants but this is the

78
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,519
general

79
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
summary glucose is the primary energy

80
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,800
source in cells and

81
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,360
is made from two three carbon ga3ps

82
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,879
now photosynthesis is a transfer of

83
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
electrons and this is what's

84
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,878
termed a redox reaction since electrons

85
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,560
have a negative charge

86
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,719
when an electron is transferred there's

87
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,239
also a change in charge

88
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,479
gaining electrons meaning you're being

89
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
reduced losing electrons it's called

90
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,598
oxidation so you think about gaining a

91
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,359
negative charge your

92
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,479
total charge is going to become negative

93
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
it's going to be reduced it's going to

94
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,598
be

95
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,319
less than what it was before this is how

96
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,039
it gets the team

97
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,958
redox reaction reduction and oxidation

98
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,318
when you're transferring the electrons

99
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
something is getting reduced and

100
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,560
something is getting oxidized

101
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
so if it wasn't this transfers electrons

102
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,598
from water to energy

103
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,158
poor carbon dioxide molecules forming

104
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,598
energy rich sugar molecules

105
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,519
so again when you're kind of gaining

106
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,679
those electrons that's part of the

107
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,879
reduction in charge and losing electrons

108
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,480
is oxidizing

109
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,878
so we have this kind of simple way to

110
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,518
remember this oxidative reduction

111
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,959
redox process the water is oxidized

112
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,719
meaning it's losing electrons and the

113
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
carboxylate is reduced means it's

114
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,598
gaining electrons

115
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,759
photosynthesis uses light energy to

116
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,439
drive these electrons from water

117
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,280
to their more energetic states of the

118
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
sugar byproducts result of solar

119
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,280
energies convert to chemical energy

120
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
now remember this is called leos the

121
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,959
lion says ger

122
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:45,439
leo l-e-o losing electrons is oxidation

123
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,479
gaining electrons is reduction so leo

124
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,199
cisger

125
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,079
very commonly said easy to remember to

126
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,238
help you remember

127
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
what's going on with a redox reaction we

128
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
see here

129
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,439
reductions are gaining electrons the

130
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,839
carbon dioxide going to the sugar and

131
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,840
water

132
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
ultimately going to the oxygen is the

133
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,598
oxidation that's losing electrons in

134
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,039
that process

135
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,798
this all takes place as i said in the

136
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,158
chloroplast so i should probably

137
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
show you what a chloroplast looks like

138
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,079
in some of the components this is

139
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,000
where that photosynthetic process is

140
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,040
occurring and i mentioned

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
also the stroma where the light

142
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,879
independent reaction or the calvin cycle

143
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,319
occurs this is all within this membrane

144
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,199
here but remember there's multiple

145
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,639
membranes

146
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
so these stacks of style code called

147
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,560
granite from a third membrane

148
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,000
as well so we can see an outer and inner

149
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,079
and kind of a third membrane this is

150
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
what's allowing these compartments to

151
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,319
very precisely control where these

152
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,160
reactions are occurring

153
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,719
now chloroplasts from multiple views

154
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
here we can see that chloroplast

155
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,520
consists of thylakoid membranes

156
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
surrounded by the stroma the thylakoid

157
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,799
membranes contain molecules of the green

158
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
pigment chlorophyll for the absorption

159
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
of light

160
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,120
you can see the cartoon image how they

161
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
look here kind of all stacks this is

162
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
what they look like in an actual

163
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,600
i mean we can see those really dark kind

164
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,918
of banding regions

165
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
are those basically those thylakoids

166
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,439
they're stacked together the furnace

167
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,399
chronum

168
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,879
the absorbed light most of the light is

169
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,439
lost

170
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,639
as heat from the leaf so that's kind of

171
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,519
an interesting note that those leaves

172
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,120
are out there but there's

173
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,879
receiving light which is great they need

174
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,399
that to be able to convert those sugars

175
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,478
but they're also getting a lot of

176
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,839
heat energy the cooling aspect of

177
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,800
transpiration is very important for

178
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,918
plant survival

179
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,439
and that transpiration is kind of like

180
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,560
the plant sweating you think of it as

181
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,038
that

182
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
in that term where those high energy

183
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,399
molecules are being evaporated

184
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,639
reducing the temperature of the leaf so

185
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,359
it doesn't burn so we have

186
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,918
photophosphorylation which is generating

187
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
atp

188
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,359
adenosine triphosphate this is the

189
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
energy used by the cells to complete its

190
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,000
necessary function

191
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
that's the highest level and eating

192
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,279
triphosphate only having two phosphates

193
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
and they've seen

194
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,399
diphosphates because the next lowest the

195
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
lowest energy form is

196
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,478
uh amp adenosine monophosphate the

197
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,680
adenosine triphosphate atp is the energy

198
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,478
currency of the cell

199
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
so it can be able to complete many

200
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,918
necessary

201
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,918
and life-supporting functions
