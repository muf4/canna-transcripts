1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
as you can tell from the length of this

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,060
video this is a very brief overview of

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,638
chemical reactions I figured I put a

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,529
picture here some fireworks indicating a

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,379
chemical reaction you've probably seen

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,359
in a very familiar way

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,089
so chemical reaction is making in

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,649
breaking chemical bonds the starting

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,320
molecules of a chemical reaction are

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,549
called reactants and the final molecules

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,429
of the chemical reaction of called

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,990
products looking our example here the

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:32,668
reactants are methane and oxygen gas

14
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:35,640
producing our products which is carbon

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,859
dioxide gas in a water vapor make no of

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,739
this reactance the products has an arrow

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,600
pointing in one direction something

18
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,488
related to biology we have

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,590
photosynthesis which is a very important

20
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,179
chemical reaction here sunlight powers

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,270
the conversion of carbon dioxide in

22
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,609
water to glucose and oxygen and we see

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,230
our reactants on this side with the

24
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,710
arrow pointing one direction to our

25
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:00,959
products to sugar and oxygen now

26
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,090
something called chemical equilibrium

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,030
this is reached when the forward and

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,829
reverse reaction rates are equal this is

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,420
indicated by this kind of half arrow

30
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,640
pointing to the right and half arrow

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,159
pointing to the left this is indicating

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,780
an equilibrium is occurring some

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,609
chemical reactions go to completion

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,930
where all reactants are converted into

35
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:21,478
products as we saw in the previous

36
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,340
slides however all cut up reactions are

37
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,819
reversible the products of the Florida

38
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,219
action become reactants their diverse

39
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:31,529
reaction in chemical equilibrium the

40
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,438
reaction actually doesn't stop it just

41
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,500
reaches a point of balance so we see

42
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,389
here we're mixing two things in the jar

43
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,849
this chemical equilibrium and things are

44
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,439
the rate of the forward reaction is

45
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,019
equal to the rate of the reverse

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,548
reaction so I think this is some sort of

47
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,739
misprint where it's like I don't really

48
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,960
know what that is weird symbol it's

49
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,819
having getting half an arrow pointing to

50
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,709
the right and half an arrow pointing to

51
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,500
the left in the king there's no net

52
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,149
change nothing is visually changing even

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,700
though reactions may be occurring

54
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,340
they're going back and forth we call

55
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,950
this chemical equilibrium because the

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,628
forward reaction or rate is equal to

57
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,319
reverse reaction rate there's

58
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:14,399
essentially no change no net change even

59
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,109
now we have an equal

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,769
distribution of forward and reverse

61
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,769
reaction ones
