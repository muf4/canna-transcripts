1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,520
so in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:16,320
i'm going to go over proper placement of

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:18,000
your carbon dioxide sensor

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,600
all right let's go over carbon dioxide

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,719
sensor placement options

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,720
for cannabis production so first off

7
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,278
keep in mind that sensors need

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,879
or should be calibrated follow factory

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,320
instructions but often this means

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,238
allowing it to sit outside

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,159
away from carbon dioxide sources to

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,078
establish 400 parts per million

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,759
and keep in mind you yourself are a

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
carbon dioxide source

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,159
note this is important to keep away from

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,558
cars people animals grills or anything

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,359
that may produce carbon oxide away from

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,759
the sensor

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,840
while it is calibrating the calibration

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,640
process can take about 15 minutes but

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,719
once it is set you will not have to be

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
central enough to be recalibrated for a

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,679
year or more

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
so keep it definitely in the iso

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,640
location for at least

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,359
that 15 minute period a sensor's reading

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
is only

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,519
as good as its placement so where you

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,319
place your sensor depends on many

30
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,519
factors

31
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,118
you need to take these into

32
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,719
consideration so that an accurate

33
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,319
reading can be obtained

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,478
the goal is to provide an accurate

35
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,000
reading so the plan's potential yield

36
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,719
can be maximized also be mindful of the

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,959
temperature

38
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,079
the sensor is exposed to as this could

39
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,679
alter the potential readings as well

40
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,118
now adjustable sensor placement can

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
sometimes be a good idea particularly

42
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,799
for indoor growing operations

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,798
is depending on the exact growing space

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
the sensor may need to be adjusted as

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
the plant grows

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,680
be sure to keep several factors in mind

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,478
to ensure consistent

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,118
and accurate readings even as the plants

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,519
might be changing as they age

50
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,640
quality sensors should have a photocell

51
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,280
so this is something you definitely want

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
to be looking

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,359
out for dosing of carbon dioxide should

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,960
only be during the light periods

55
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,759
since this is when the plants are

56
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,599
actively used using carbon dioxide

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,959
adding carbon acid at night or during

58
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,438
the lights off period

59
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,399
of the day was it would be not

60
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,639
beneficial

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
so that photo sensor the goal is to only

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
have it go through the process when

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
there's a sufficient light for this

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,280
synthetic process during the night time

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
or lights off

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
the sensor should essentially stop

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,400
dosing

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,800
carbon dioxide now as with any sensor

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,080
be careful there's usually a sulfur

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
vaporizer warning

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,840
this one is stated here as an example

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
you always want to read the complete

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,560
instructions with your unit before you

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
using it and if you are using a sulfur

75
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,598
vaporizer

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,598
just keep that in mind that in this

77
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,318
example the atlas 8

78
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,039
they state clearly and they put it in

79
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
red

80
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,079
that if you're using a cell vaporizer

81
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,959
this will basically avoid the warranty

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,800
and damage the infrared co2 sensor so if

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,039
you're using a sulfur vaporizer

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
do not have your co2 sensor in the room

85
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,159
at the same time

86
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,079
so generally there's three sensor

87
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,239
placements to be considering

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
there's above the plant there's midway

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,039
up the plant and there's towards the

90
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,039
bottom of the plant

91
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,439
we find those usually above plant height

92
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,840
at plant height and below plant height

93
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,759
note that the injection method can also

94
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,759
influence the placement but in general

95
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,799
assuming even carbon dioxide

96
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,959
distribution

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,159
where would you place your sensor and

98
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,640
keep in mind that co2

99
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,959
is heavier than normal atmospheric air

100
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,598
which is composed mostly of nitrogen

101
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,319
so if you put the sensor placement below

102
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,560
plant height

103
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,119
the advantage is if you put it down here

104
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,878
ensures the maximum concentration of co2

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
is getting to the plant

106
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,560
may cause an increase in usage

107
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
especially if there's an exhaust or

108
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,239
carbon filter

109
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,679
set up so again keep this in mind that

110
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
if you're placing your sensor below

111
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,519
plant height

112
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,359
because scarborough next will naturally

113
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,039
fall down you're ensuring that you get

114
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,280
the maximum concentration that gets

115
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,639
to the plant but it may cause increase

116
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,919
in usage

117
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,119
so what if you put it at the plant

118
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,199
height well the advantage is this

119
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
provides an average reading

120
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,158
the disadvantages that may be below the

121
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,840
injection point will provide and higher

122
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,519
than actual reading so keep in mind

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,680
where this might be in relation

124
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,438
to your dosing or addition of carbon

125
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,000
dioxide to the grow space

126
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,799
and lastly if you choose to put it above

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,719
plant height

128
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
the advantages will be the least

129
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,879
impacted by exhaust ventilation systems

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
can cause a hot but it can cause a

131
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,879
higher reading since carboxylate is

132
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,280
heavier than the air as a disadvantage

133
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,040
so evaluate these positions look the

134
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,279
plants look at the growing area

135
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
and make a decision on where you would

136
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,959
place your

137
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
sensor
