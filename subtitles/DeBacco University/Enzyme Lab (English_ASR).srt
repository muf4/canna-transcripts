1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,240
here on this enzyme lab we're going to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,559
use common household items such as

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,879
potato carrots and mushrooms along with

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,519
hydrogen peroxide to study the catalyse

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,960
enzyme

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,399
[Music]

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
okay so here we're going to be looking

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,358
at a catalase enzyme normal reaction

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
you're looking at catalase contains in

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,480
this potato we're looking at potato and

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,399
how it reacts to hydrogen peroxide this

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
is typical store-bought and this is

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,159
looking at about three percent hydrogen

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,839
peroxide here so we're going to see how

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,319
this reacts and look at some

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,559
observations here we're going to observe

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,000
a normal catalyst reaction so i've cut a

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,439
piece of potato

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
and we're going to add that to the test

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,599
tube i've got the four mils of hydrogen

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
peroxide located right there so let me

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,198
just drop that in

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,198
and let's just observe what happens

24
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,689
[Music]

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
seeing that slow release there seeing

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,840
the concentration of those bubbles

27
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,839
forming at the top

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:28,319
again this is just a regular potato and

29
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,599
three percent hydrogen peroxide

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,199
so here we are back at our first

31
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,798
reaction we're noticing that's still

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,880
reacting a little bit but it's

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
definitely slowed down so we're going to

34
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,759
progress with this portion of the lab

35
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,759
now now reading the lab instructions are

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,920
instructed to take the liquid from test

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
tube one this is test tube one here and

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
put it into a second

39
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,599
test tube so i'm gonna do is take the

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,239
liquid from here

41
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,280
and we're simply going to

42
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,078
pour it into our second test tube trying

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,718
to make sure we don't also include the

44
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,718
potato

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,640
so it's pouring off that liquid

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,840
decanting that liquid there

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,559
okay so now i've got a liquid poured off

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,439
from the first test tube put into the

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
second

50
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,840
and the question now asks

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,480
well what would happen if i added

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,878
another piece of potato so i've cut a

53
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,959
fresh piece of potato of similar size

54
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,639
similar surface area we're going to add

55
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,560
it here to the

56
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,719
test tube

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
and we're going to see what happens for

58
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,680
the reaction

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,120
so i drop it in there

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
let's take a quick observation

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,640
and if we look here at the test tube we

62
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,799
are seeing some bubble formation

63
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,279
but that is a fresh piece of potato and

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,239
we can clearly see that the reaction

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,400
rate is definitely reduced than we saw

66
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
with the first reaction there so

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,719
important to keep in mind that the

68
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,318
variability that we have here in the

69
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:07,039
sense that well we have that catalase

70
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,958
enzyme is at the same concentration here

71
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,439
the reactants

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,000
aren't fully there we've reacted a lot

73
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,400
of the hydrogen peroxide away and while

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,959
there is still some left overall that

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,439
reaction is greatly reduced from we saw

76
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,199
it before

77
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,919
now in contrast here we're looking at

78
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,759
that first piece of potato and what i

79
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,119
have now is

80
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,239
the same

81
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,480
four mils of hydrogen peroxide there a

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,759
fresh four mils of hydrogen peroxide and

83
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,238
i'm going to add it to our original

84
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,798
potato and see what happens here for a

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,799
reaction

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
as as we can see there

87
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,759
and i spilled just a little bit

88
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,759
looking

89
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,518
very closely there yeah just a little

90
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,518
bit more

91
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
make sure that they're even

92
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,080
so we got the same amount there's some

93
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,799
knob that i spilled

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,599
so there now for looking at the reaction

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,799
we do see it reacting but reacting very

96
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,359
slowly

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,438
compared to the initial reaction you can

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,840
see that that is definitely much reduced

99
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,120
and if we do a quick comparison

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,959
looking at kind of a normal sized

101
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,280
normal potato

102
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,199
we'll see that there is a difference so

103
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:30,478
for comparison purposes if i take that

104
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,840
fresh four mils of hydrogen peroxide and

105
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,360
a brand new

106
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,918
fresh potato and i add it there

107
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,400
we can see the difference now in

108
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,879
reaction rate it takes just a couple

109
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,279
seconds to get going

110
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,879
but we are noticing definitely more

111
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,918
bubbles being produced here with the

112
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,839
fresh potato and fresh hydrogen peroxide

113
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,399
compared to the potato that already went

114
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,279
through a reaction we and we then added

115
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,279
fresh hydrogen peroxide here was the

116
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,198
decanted hydrogen peroxide the ones that

117
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,198
had went through the reaction with a

118
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,160
fresh piece of potato

119
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,400
and again those these two are reacting

120
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,360
somewhat but definitely much reduced now

121
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,359
we can see compared to the original this

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,000
goes back to products and reactants as

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,879
far as how much do we have of each and

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,879
when one is used up the is becomes a

125
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,560
limiting reactant

126
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,600
and this is just a great visual to kind

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,600
of show that looking specifically at the

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,199
catalase enzyme

129
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
so here i have some different food items

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,759
and we're going to assess the amount of

131
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,758
catalase enzyme they have based on their

132
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,600
reaction with hydrogen peroxide so i've

133
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,840
got the potato i've got the carrot and

134
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,680
i've got a mushroom i've cut

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,079
sections here try to keep the surface

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,639
area the same and i'm going to now add

137
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,719
them to the respective test tubes and

138
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,879
we're going to see how the reaction

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
rates may differ in relation to the

140
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,159
amount of catalase enzyme each of these

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
contains

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,720
so i'm going to add the try and draw at

143
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,038
the same time

144
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,039
those two

145
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,749
[Music]

146
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,199
so again the more bubble production

147
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,599
we're associating with greater catalyst

148
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
enzyme

149
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,599
just to keep everything consistent

150
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,519
that

151
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,520
their reaction make sure they're all

152
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,519
submerged in that potatoes down there

153
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,119
so you can look at our rate of reaction

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,840
make sure they're all kind of coming in

155
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,759
contact

156
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,959
adequately let's kind of see the

157
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
differences that might be occurring

158
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,079
so now i want to look and see how

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,439
temperature will affect this catalase

160
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,560
enzyme and here we have a piece of

161
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,319
potato

162
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,120
and i've tried to keep all the potato

163
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,360
pieces consistent we have this in a warm

164
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,439
water bath so when i say warm water well

165
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,439
what does that actually mean

166
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,680
let's take the temperature of our warm

167
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,360
water bath there we're going to let this

168
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,079
sit in there for

169
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,319
approximately maybe five minutes or so

170
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,918
just to ensure the potatoes fully

171
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,598
exposed to that

172
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,359
temperature but just under 64 63.7 is

173
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,399
where it has settled out and this is our

174
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,520
warm

175
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,878
warm water bath here moving on from warm

176
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,878
water

177
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,120
we're going to go to the ice water bath

178
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,199
so ice water bath

179
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
here i have just kind of some ice water

180
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
it is melting

181
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,400
kind of determine what the temperature

182
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,960
is of that ice water

183
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,439
we've got our little potato

184
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,598
literally chilling in there

185
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,759
let's see and as would be expected it's

186
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,079
much cooler and here we're looking at

187
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
not quite zero degrees celsius looking

188
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,560
at about 0.4

189
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,478
degrees celsius so very close okay so

190
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,240
moving on to room temperature we can see

191
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,639
here the room temperature one is

192
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,478
balanced out at 22.0 degrees celsius

193
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,598
lastly here progressing to the boiling

194
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,839
water one

195
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,279
you can see the water is boiling

196
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:35,519
at the

197
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,319
thermometer in there take a look

198
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,200
looking like specifically

199
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,760
gonna balance out right at 100 degrees

200
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,000
celsius for our boiling water potato

201
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,039
we'll let that sit so as we saw earlier

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,200
what i have now is potatoes that have

203
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,199
been in different temperatures for

204
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,680
approximately 10 minutes

205
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,680
this one was in an ice water this one

206
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,399
was in room temperature this one is in a

207
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,799
warm temperature and this was at boiling

208
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
so what i have now is four mils of

209
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,399
hydrogen peroxide i'm going to add to

210
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,559
each and we will now see how they react

211
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,759
these potatoes after being in these

212
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,759
different environments

213
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,720
so again as the ice water

214
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,719
this one is room temperature

215
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,360
and then we have warm water

216
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,519
and then we have

217
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,518
boiling water

218
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,679
okay so this shows a

219
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,919
difference in temperature that

220
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,559
everything was exposed to here we have

221
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,919
hydrogen peroxide that was chilled in an

222
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,719
ice water bath

223
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,039
this was the hydrogen peroxide was kept

224
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,519
at room temperature

225
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,519
this where it was warmed in the warm

226
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,320
water bath and here the potato was left

227
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,240
at boiling so in all of these cases we

228
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
boiled the potato we warmed the potato

229
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,519
up we have room temperature and then we

230
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,679
have chilled potato and peroxide now you

231
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,278
can see as it's warming up we're

232
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,000
noticing that there is a little bit of a

233
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,480
reaction occurring here by far the room

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
temperature is performing the best with

235
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,399
the greatest amount of bubbles produced

236
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,000
the warmed one this does have a couple

237
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,159
bubbles produced but nothing really

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,480
great and the boiling one is just

239
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,879
stagnant or sitting there so what does

240
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,839
this tell us about the optimum rate in

241
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,679
temperature for the catalase enzyme so

242
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,120
we're looking at ph in the first test

243
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,759
tube here i've added hydrochloric acid

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,759
this middle one here is regular tap

245
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,838
water very neutral ph

246
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,319
and then the last one has had its sodium

247
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,680
hydroxide added to it so if we're

248
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
thinking about it this way we're

249
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,199
increasing ph from a very low ph to a

250
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,078
neutral tweah to a basic ph

251
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,240
so now i have prepared equal sized

252
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,479
potato pieces and we're going to add

253
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,079
them to this hydrogen peroxide that has

254
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,320
had its ph adjusted either lower normal

255
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,799
or higher and we're going to see how

256
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,800
they react

257
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,160
so again it takes just a little while to

258
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,159
get going

259
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,240
but as we look carefully

260
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,720
we can definitely see that the acid this

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,519
one located right here is at definitely

262
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,600
occurring at a reduced rate

263
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,639
kind of with that black background you

264
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,759
can see the base here is reacting to

265
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,278
some degree

266
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:56,399
but definitely that more neutral ph of 7

267
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,679
has the greatest production there of the

268
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
bubbles

269
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,958
but looking at this we're definitely

270
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,278
concluding that the ph definitely does

271
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,039
impact the catalase enzyme

272
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,679
and we're noticing that there is that

273
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,360
difference in reaction and we could see

274
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,159
what environment the catalyst enzyme

275
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,800
would not be favorable in again still

276
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,879
able to react to some degree now at this

277
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,559
end at the acidic end

278
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,240
but we're looking at the defining the

279
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,838
optimum rate you can see that there's

280
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
definitely a difference there
