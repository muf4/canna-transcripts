1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,040
so here we're going to have some entire

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,000
track evidence and kind of what's

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,878
included

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240
in collection of this particular form of

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,320
evidence

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,679
so first off we want to be looking at

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,759
when we're documenting

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,798
uh tire tracks we're going to be looking

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,039
also at the

10
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,239
width of that tire track we also want to

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,800
be considering the wheelbase

12
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,640
dimensions and that gets into the

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
specifics of the vehicle

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,000
if there was a turn involved could we

15
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,920
get the turning diameter

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,359
and also the relative position of the

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,080
turning tracks because this will all

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,840
kind of play

19
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,599
into determining potentially what size

20
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,800
or what proportion vehicle

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,120
made those tracks so this vehicle tire

22
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,759
width so the width is the stance

23
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,878
that we're looking at the track width

24
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,119
it's a measurement made from

25
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
the one center of one wheel to the

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,718
opposite center of the

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,920
other wheel and again this is considered

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,600
the track width

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,719
the front wheels turning produce

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,879
unreliable measurements so rear wheels

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,239
accurately record turns because they're

32
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,799
going to remain always

33
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,558
consistent so it's again looking at that

34
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,920
track width for the rear tires

35
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,560
would be the measurement we want to try

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,719
to determine or take

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,680
we have something called a wheelbase so

38
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,679
the wheelbase

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,720
is the measurement of the center of hubs

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,479
from the front wheels

41
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,879
to the center of hubs from the rear

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,438
wheels normally these measurements are

43
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,399
not present at a crime scene but they

44
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,079
can kind of

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
help indicate if we have a suspect's

46
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,280
vehicle is important to take that into

47
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,118
consideration

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
now if it's just a regular car they may

49
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,319
not vary that much

50
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,759
but for example here in the extreme case

51
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,239
we have a limo uh we

52
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
will have which will have a much longer

53
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,319
wheelbase

54
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,599
we could have something really short

55
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,399
like this little kart it's gonna have a

56
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,319
very short

57
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
wheelbase and that's again center of

58
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,798
front tire to the center of the

59
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,359
rear tire you have something called

60
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,118
turning

61
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,359
diameter so when we're looking at

62
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,799
turning diameter it's a diameter of

63
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,399
circle the vehicle makes when

64
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079
steering wheels are fully turned

65
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,879
pertains to front wheels

66
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,438
only turn diameter is measured by b

67
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,000
squared

68
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,839
over a plus a where b is the distance

69
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,438
between two points

70
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
on the turning circle and a is a

71
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,239
distance between outer

72
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,959
margin and midpoint between x and x

73
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,039
not there so this is just a way to try

74
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,120
to determine that turning diameter

75
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,840
which can be involved if there are skid

76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,319
marks or indications if a

77
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,878
car was able to leave very quickly we're

78
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,639
skidding

79
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,479
area and these tire tracks were made

80
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,399
this turning diameter could play into

81
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,959
determining whether or not the suspect's

82
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
car

83
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,479
could have made those prints

84
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
we have the position of tire in a turn

85
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,679
so again if you can find turns those are

86
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,799
great indicators

87
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
because when a vehicle moves in a

88
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
straight path only the rear tire tracks

89
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
are

90
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,318
available to us as researchers and

91
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
investigators

92
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,919
however when the vehicle turns the rear

93
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,759
and front tire tracks

94
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,359
rack separately so you can get an

95
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,560
indication of both

96
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
it's important to understand and

97
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,239
document these at a crime scene

98
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,000
now we see the obvious year of made in

99
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,560
sand are made in snow

100
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,759
but if they're looking at over a mud or

101
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,158
a gravel area potentially or a soft

102
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,239
substance in any way looking at those

103
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,759
tire positions and related to a turn

104
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,360
can be a very important piece of

105
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,598
information

106
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
now lastly if we're going to recover

107
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,280
this particular evidence

108
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,238
as i said typically mean the soft

109
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,919
substance which makes it really easy or

110
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
really easy to see but can be a little

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,238
fragile to be able to collect that

112
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,560
evidence

113
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
so first off we want to take photographs

114
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,039
from all angles

115
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,598
with and without measurement tools and

116
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,000
ruler if possible want to take a cast

117
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,000
over about

118
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,560
three foot impression and that requires

119
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
about 15 to 25 pounds of dental stone if

120
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
you're really looking at capturing some

121
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,280
of the details

122
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,480
of that we do want to measure the width

123
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,959
length and depth

124
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,238
and the direction of travel noted

125
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,479
impressions could be made

126
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,439
if possible but pictures of the source

127
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,479
tire

128
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,840
must be included for comparison so yes

129
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,039
it's important to document those

130
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,878
impressions but we also

131
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,039
need to try to match it up to the source

132
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,318
tire to be able to determine whether or

133
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,679
not it was possible

134
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:07,679
for the suspect's tires to have made the

135
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
impressions found at the crime scene
