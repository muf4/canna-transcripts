1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
here I'm gonna go over lactose

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,509
intolerance in the production of lactose

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,570
free milk so letÃµs naturally occurs in

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,969
cow's milk and it's found in many milk

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,048
and milk related products here this is

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,378
what it looks like it's called a

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,629
disaccharide you need an enzyme to be

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,210
able to break down lactose in our bodies

9
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,589
to be able to use it for energy so many

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,900
people actually have problems with the

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,759
digestion of milk and milk products this

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,129
is what they do drink lots of milk or

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,550
consume lactose you can have a lot of

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,869
unpleasant side effects across the world

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,599
there are certain regions that have

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:39,780
higher chances of having this lactose

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,289
intolerance worldwide when 80% of adults

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,149
cannot digest milk sugar or let those in

19
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,570
this condition is called lactose

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,140
intolerance so it's in ability to have

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,299
the enzyme to break down lactose you can

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,308
see that represented here on the world

23
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,009
map with the darker colors being the

24
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:01,799
higher percent and again about 80% of

25
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,829
adults worldwide do not groups lactase

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:08,728
so lack tastes the last three letters

27
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:10,890
being ASE that suffix ace tends to refer

28
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,469
to an enzyme in here this is the enzyme

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,750
lactase which would break down lactose

30
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,459
you see these darker regions again here

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,500
are were the higher odds of being

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:24,298
lactose intolerant are these lighter

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,459
greens are reduced odds of that so this

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,850
is kind of gives you an idea what the

35
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:33,569
molecule kind of looks like we should

36
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:35,129
say the enzyme here lactase so left with

37
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,109
some tolerant adults begin their lives

38
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:41,009
drinking milk from a bottle or

39
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:44,578
breastfeeding and this is allows them to

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,009
digest it completely so early on in life

41
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:48,989
babies produced this enzyme lactase and

42
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,599
again it's pictured right here in their

43
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:55,379
small intestine this Ihnen breaks down

44
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,688
lactose remember ace for last and suffix

45
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,468
breaks down lactose therefore if we look

46
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:04,769
at babies babies are lactose tolerant so

47
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:10,079
as humans we start our our lives as

48
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:12,628
lactose tolerant lactase is a pair of

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,890
molecules that we need to break apart

50
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:17,099
here so

51
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,259
the enzyme lactase will snip the

52
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,090
disaccharide disaccharide meaning two

53
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:24,539
sugars receive two sugars located right

54
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:28,020
here of lactose into two simple sugars

55
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:30,750
or monosaccharides here galactose and

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,090
glucose here so we see them being broken

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,830
apart here with the lactase enzyme and

58
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:41,520
we see water here so lactose tolerant

59
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,350
individuals produce lactase for life for

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,170
them eating and consuming milk is

61
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:48,239
perfectly fine you know people enjoy

62
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:51,059
milk chocolate here it's a perfectly

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,760
fine experience however for those of

64
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,219
lactose intolerant how the body reacts

65
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,259
to not being able to break down this

66
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,509
disaccharide you see a lot of negative

67
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:03,870
effects not a vomiting diarrhea blood

68
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:05,729
feeling stomach cramps to help people

69
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,950
that are lactose intolerant the

70
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,590
undigested lactose in the small large

71
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:13,649
intestine is what causes the discomforts

72
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,530
so as a result we have ways to kind of

73
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,659
combat this there's lactase tablets

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,580
which can be taken with lactose

75
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,079
containing meals to help break it down

76
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,080
you're kind of consuming the enzyme that

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,130
your body doesn't naturally produce

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
lactose free milk products are produced

79
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:31,500
by breaking down lactose using lactase

80
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,929
so that's supplementing that beforehand

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,120
before the product comes to the person

82
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,280
consuming it lastly there's sour milk

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,920
products where the lactose it's inverted

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,599
to lactic acid using microbes so the

85
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,780
ways we can help people that are lactose

86
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,250
intolerant there's a market for lactose

87
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,530
free products and on the rise such as

88
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,689
ice creams yogurts and puddings cheeses

89
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,099
there's increasing demand for this

90
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,709
because of the high percentage of people

91
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:59,039
that are lactose intolerant there's an

92
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,920
increasing range of options because of

93
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,280
the different mechanisms we have to

94
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:09,030
reduce the presence of lactose in

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,500
certain products one of those is

96
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,439
large-scale industrial production of

97
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,810
lactose free milk so here we have all

98
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,029
these beads in this beaker and what

99
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,189
happens is we can produce lactase

100
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,348
enzymes even though it's expensive it

101
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:24,089
can be manufactured by micro organisms

102
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:25,629
and then purified from these

103
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,989
microorganisms

104
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:32,319
here we can coat these small beads here

105
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,910
with the lactase enzyme from here we can

106
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,069
run milk through this and be a large

107
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,530
column so we can run milk continuously

108
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,060
pumped through this because enzymes are

109
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:44,439
not consumed and used up they will go

110
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,870
through and break down the lactose with

111
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:51,639
the lactase enzymes and this will result

112
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:54,370
in the end product being a lactose free

113
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,229
milk product there's no residual lactase

114
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,629
in the milk and the enzyme can be reused

115
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,150
frequently so by using this lactase

116
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:03,519
enzyme and artificially creating it and

117
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:06,399
running milk products for it we can take

118
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,399
our lactase enzyme that's coated here

119
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,250
and break down the lactose so that

120
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:16,329
people that lack the lactase enzyme can

121
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,230
consume milk in related products so it

122
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,879
gives you just a little bit of a

123
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,980
background if you know someone or even

124
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,980
yourself is lactose intolerant
