00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,318
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,039
going to be looking at the sterile

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,679
seed bed technique which is a technique

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
used

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:17,920
to manage weeds on a large scale field

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,920
as we can see here in practice

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,518
all right let's get into the sterile

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,039
seed bed technique to manage weeds in a

9
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,639
cannabis field

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
so first off what does this technique

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,719
involve well this technique is based on

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,238
allowing weed seeds just below the soil

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,320
surface to germinate

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,159
and then are killed prior to planting

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,878
the cash crop while minimizing

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,199
soil disturbance weeds which germinate

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,519
and emerge before the crop is planted

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,760
are simply easier to manage while this

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,680
process can be overlooked it can be

20
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,960
very effective so what you're seeing

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,439
here is we have our seed bread

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,359
preparation we're allowing some certain

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,558
weed seeds then to kind of germinate we

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,558
kill those off

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,640
and then by not tilling the soil that

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,959
mixing everything up we're

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
keeping our weed seeds down below where

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
they can germinate and that's allowing

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
our

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,640
intended crop to go through and be the

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,159
one to grow

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,200
with less weed pressure now this basic

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,960
process

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
is cultivating the soil promotes weed

35
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,919
seed germination

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,079
of the total amount of weed seeds

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,560
present a small percentage

38
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,400
are non-dormant and able to germinate

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
really at any given time

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
this can quickly and be the fir these

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
can be the quick ones and the first ones

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
to emerge

43
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,679
most weeds only emerge from seeds in the

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
top kind of shallow layer

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,240
about top two and a half inches or so of

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
soil and most typically emerge only in

47
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,478
significant numbers from the top

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,560
one inch of soil cereal seed bed

49
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,039
technique works by targeting weed seeds

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,439
in this

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
shallow layer reason why seeds can

52
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,959
germinate in this shallow area

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
is some of them are actually have

54
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,118
photoreceptors they're actually light

55
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,879
sensitive

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,879
so they know if they're in that top inch

57
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,959
they're getting some sunlight exposure

58
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,239
that's going to signal them to germinate

59
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,438
they're down below that where it's

60
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,478
completely dark all the time they're

61
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,158
going to remain dormant

62
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,879
if you go through and till them up well

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,239
then it will start to emerge

64
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,478
so how are the weeds killed

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
well ideally practices that minimize

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
soil disturbance because deep tilling

67
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,799
the weeds

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,479
will not only bring up more weed seeds

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,040
to the surface and essentially go

70
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,199
against the basis for this technique

71
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,719
examples include often preferred will be

72
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
herbicide application

73
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,280
a weed flamer which can be very

74
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,719
effective shallow rotary cultivation or

75
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,519
simply a hoe

76
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,959
so we can see all of these methods can

77
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,759
all be incorporated

78
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
as part of the sterile seed bed small

79
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,598
manual operation

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,519
a loop or sterpo can be great larger

81
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,799
scale we can see these utilized

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,879
herbicides might be possible and also

83
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
flame leaders can also be a possible

84
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,359
technique utilized again with caution

85
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
so why not use this technique after

86
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
talking about all the good things about

87
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,238
it

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,480
well while this technique can be

89
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,400
effective if you're have the following

90
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,719
conditions the weed control percentage

91
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,000
may not be as high as you would like

92
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,919
the weeds are lengthy emergent periods

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,318
they germinate over a long period of

94
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,158
time if the soil conditions such as

95
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,158
moisture and temperature impacting weed

96
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,598
emergence particularly dry conditions

97
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,079
may not allow for weeds

98
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,598
to germinate as an example unable to

99
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040
implement weed control when crop is

100
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,799
growing as this can restrict multiple

101
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,878
weed germination periods

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,560
and also control so if you have these

103
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,239
particular situations this may not be

104
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
the best method

105
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,280
so again want to caution you to just

106
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,639
commit to this if you look at these

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,199
conditions they're very common in your

108
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,000
area

109
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,798
may not be the best method timing the

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,479
state the

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,799
sterile seed bed technique so again

112
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,518
timing is kind of uh important with this

113
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,120
method

114
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
the stale seabed technique can be

115
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
initiated several days

116
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
weeks or months prior to seeding or

117
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
transplanting the crop

118
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,759
simply put the goal is to kind of let

119
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,199
those

120
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,878
weeds germinate that are in the surface

121
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,560
kind of kill those weeds off let a

122
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,798
couple more germinate kills weeds off

123
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,479
without doing a massive disturbance and

124
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,438
the further ahead you can do this ahead

125
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,280
of the crop

126
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,039
the more likely you are to germinate the

127
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,438
weed seeds and remove those

128
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,280
to give your chosen crop a little bit of

129
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,878
a head start before it starts shading

130
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
out hopefully the soil there

131
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,239
so this gives you just a little

132
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,959
background here of the sterile seabed

133
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,959
technique
