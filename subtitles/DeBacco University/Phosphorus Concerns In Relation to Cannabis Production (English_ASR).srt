1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,040
this is something you don't hear too

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,960
much about but looking at

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
phosphorus concerns related to cannabis

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,199
production here on tobacco university

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
we're going to look at some of

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,039
what's happening with the phosphorus

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,920
fertilizer and how this relates to the

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,919
cannabis industry

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,920
[Music]

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,839
all right let's go over some phosphorous

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
concerns in relation to cannabis

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,960
production

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
so first off phosphorus is an important

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,480
plant nutrient

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,238
while phosphorus is needed by plants

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,279
growers often apply phosphorus in

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,359
quantities

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,200
that the plant cannot simply consume

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,640
leading to wasting the nutrient

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,640
a lot of these phosphorus fertilizers

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,840
come very potent this creates the

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,359
potential for environmental

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,680
contamination and also

24
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,399
increased cost with no return on

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,679
investment

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,359
so you're continuing the environment

27
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,479
increasing your cost without increasing

28
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,679
your yields

29
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,679
all negative situations there so let's

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,558
look at the some of the phosphate mines

31
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,320
so there's limited reserves worldwide

32
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,239
only seven mines in the u.s with the

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
majority coming from florida

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
here's the world total of nitrogen

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
consumption phosphorus consumption

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
look at nitrogen phosphorus again we see

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
asia kind of increasing the fertilizer

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,359
consumption overall so we are seeing

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,759
this trend

40
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,959
in increased need for phosphorus even

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,000
though worldwide it's

42
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,719
very limiting so let's look at the u.s

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
mind

44
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,560
data here of phosphate rock from the

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,560
year 1900 to 2015.

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
the amount of u.s mined phosphorus has

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,920
shown a decrease

48
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,600
since the kind of 1980s or so

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
many would think this would correlate

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,280
with a decrease in demand or consumption

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,680
however this graph does not tell the

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
full story while it is true

53
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,079
remarkable rock phosphate uh in metric

54
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,639
tons mind in the united states is

55
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,599
has been on the decrease since the 1980s

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
however

57
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,399
unless it doesn't contain the full story

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
this contains a little bit more of that

59
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,118
fuller picture

60
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,199
because while u.s mind phosphorus has

61
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,438
decreased over the same time period

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,240
this has gone from an exporter to an

63
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,478
importer of

64
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,319
rock phosphate this is in part due to

65
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,399
the decreased impurity of

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,399
phosphorus mines the united states see

67
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,800
here in 1980s we did a lot of exporting

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,639
exporting decreased and now imports are

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,360
on the increase we're taking more

70
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,318
phosphate

71
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,000
in from other countries so why focus on

72
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,238
phosphorus well it's a nutrient

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
that growers tend to over apply due to

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,439
the idea that it will induce flowering

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,920
so while important for flowering growers

76
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,520
tend to over apply it which is a concern

77
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,518
due to the potential problems facing

78
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
phosphorus in the near future

79
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,879
so we want to be mindful of these super

80
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,280
strong potent fertilizers

81
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,159
we need to use them in very limiting

82
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
quantities

83
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,878
we don't want to just keep adding a

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
bunch of these because we'll be wasting

85
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,719
that phosphorous which is a very

86
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,840
precious

87
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,560
nutrient so at limited resource

88
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,680
so phosphorus is a kind of

89
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,120
non-substitutional component of all

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
living organisms

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,039
this nutrient is critical element for

92
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,280
plant growth and as a result

93
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,199
also the food chain using fertilizer

94
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,080
derived from phosphate rock has made an

95
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,158
increase in food

96
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,280
production possible and reduced the

97
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,840
malnourishment since

98
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
the mid 20th century all very good

99
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,878
things

100
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,399
however recent worries about the future

101
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,919
shortage of phosphorus have sparked

102
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,280
debate over the lifespan

103
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,958
of existing reserves and all kind of put

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
at varying degrees of when we will

105
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,439
actually run out

106
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,839
now this is a freshwater contaminant so

107
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,079
phosphorus can speed up the

108
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,239
etrophication

109
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
which is a reduction in dissolved oxygen

110
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,599
in freshwater bodies

111
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
caused by an increase of mineral and

112
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,919
organic nutrients of

113
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,598
rivers and lakes soil erosion is also a

114
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,318
major contributor of phosphorus to

115
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:40,399
streams

116
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,560
however it's not just limited to streams

117
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,959
here's an algal bloom of lake erie taken

118
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
from a satellite in 2011 we can see all

119
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,680
this green

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,598
is where all the algae blooms are

121
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
occurring this is one of the great lakes

122
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,359
so while we may see it in small rivers

123
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,318
and ponds it's also a concern there

124
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,000
this can also impact the large scale so

125
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,878
as cannabis growers they need to be

126
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
aware of

127
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,598
not over adding phosphorus and to be

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,519
mindful of this limited resource

129
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,280
and to not create environmental

130
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,360
pollutants that could affect

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
very large scale bodies of water
