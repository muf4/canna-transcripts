1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
so a lot of times we talk about taking a

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,120
soil sample and sending it off to the

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,620
lab now that's a good thing sometimes

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,960
it's forgotten about the proper method

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,269
about going about when collecting that

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,219
soil sample and the importance of

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,660
following a proper method as you can

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,149
send something accurate to the lab

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,800
reason why this is so important is the

10
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,778
lab is only as good as a sample you

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,310
provide them it's your responsibility to

12
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,739
follow the proper sample technique to

13
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,509
ensure the results the lab provides are

14
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,399
representative of your field conditions

15
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,260
the labs going to test the soil or to

16
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,460
send them and give you results your goal

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,380
is to make sure that's a representative

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,750
of your field so that the results that

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,780
they give you can be applied to your

20
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,250
exact particular situation now how to

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,370
properly correct a soil sample there's

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,558
kind of a few different ways I like to

23
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,419
use kind of a simple way my step one is

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,058
to collect something you can pour the

25
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,340
soil with and typically a 16 inch piece

26
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,979
of inch and a PVC pipe works great it's

27
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,980
easily found it's inert so again this is

28
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,509
a great tool to have then I take a

29
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,979
five-gallon pail you may need to add a

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:03,628
plastic bag to ensure there's no

31
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,209
contamination depending with that bag

32
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:08,219
that pail was used for previously when a

33
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,140
clean bags are getting a clean sample

34
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,450
they take a large hammer for pounding a

35
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,040
PVC pipe into the ground so I got a PVC

36
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,380
pipe I got a five-gallon pail with shoes

37
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,560
you has a bag liner and I have a large

38
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:22,019
hammer step 2 is to market gradations on

39
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,570
that PVC pipe so you know where 6 8 10

40
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,759
maybe even 12 inches are your goal is to

41
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,589
get a soil sample of 6 to 8 inches deep

42
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,719
depending on the soil type you may want

43
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,609
to go deeper so I kinda have six as that

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,769
minimum they hit a rock or something if

45
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,609
I can get down to 6 to maybe 9 inches

46
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,599
that's great

47
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:41,400
I don't want to go much over 12 I'll

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,739
step 3 we walk randomly over your

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,630
growing air taking about a dozen or so

50
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,438
cores or samples that we place in your

51
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,810
five-gallon pail

52
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,148
they'll be sure to avoid potential

53
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,310
biases such as corners edges or areas of

54
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,689
uneven fertilization the whole point

55
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,579
here is you want that representative

56
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,109
sample if you want to just walk from one

57
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:59,819
corner right down the line take all your

58
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,769
course this way you kind of want to take

59
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,718
one maybe from the middle one over here

60
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,819
over here come back around take them

61
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,468
over here kind of gives you that random

62
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,659
kind of sampling you want to typically

63
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:11,340
avoid corners because they may get over

64
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,409
or under fertilized and they may not be

65
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,890
representative of the field and why just

66
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,629
to avoid

67
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,329
the Long's one straight line here that

68
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:20,280
nice random sample is going to provide

69
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,709
you with the most field representative

70
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,180
results now after you have all those

71
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,430
cores you want to mix up your sample in

72
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,439
the pail want to take a subset sample of

73
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,659
that that sub sample should be about a

74
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,069
couple of soil you don't want to send

75
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,259
them like a really small cut a thimble

76
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,759
you want to send that full cup there

77
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,159
because it's gonna allow them to perform

78
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,219
the test that they need in an accurate

79
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,049
manner step 5 which is probably the most

80
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,459
annoying of all the steps sometimes it

81
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,830
is to fill out the appropriate paperwork

82
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,709
I'll label the bags with your sample the

83
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,390
title was your name mail to the lab one

84
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,370
hint if you are mailing a lot of samples

85
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,609
zolab you might not consider flat rate

86
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,769
boxes because it fits it ships and so it

87
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,810
can be very heavy so if you get charged

88
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,509
by the weight that can increase your

89
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,370
cost of shipping a lot they can fit into

90
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,319
one the flat rate boxes that might be an

91
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,909
advantageous and cost-effective way to

92
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,049
go

93
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:11,609
so when filling out your paperwork so

94
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,590
you want to be sure that there's a lot

95
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,420
of test options typically which one's

96
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,039
best for me typically you could look at

97
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,869
what they have necessary I want to go

98
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,159
with the cheapest or all of them we want

99
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,629
to look at what's going to fit your

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,120
conditions what's going to give you the

101
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:25,889
most amount not of information just the

102
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,509
most amount of useful information

103
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,069
I start with determining why you're

104
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:30,719
testing your sample do you have any

105
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,099
background on the not on the area you're

106
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,280
just looking for the general nutrient

107
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:38,069
profile adjust the pH for Seibel salts

108
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,689
what organic matter again those are a

109
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,729
lot of options there when in doubt you

110
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:43,500
can always contact the lab but just in

111
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,789
general you're looking at typically that

112
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,439
standard soil tests will give you great

113
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,120
base information and then there's

114
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,329
typically more details available from

115
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,329
there
