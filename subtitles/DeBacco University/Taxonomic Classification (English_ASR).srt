1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,189
okay here we're gonna be looking at the

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,300
attack Sonic classification system and

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,859
it's a way that we simply develop and

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,170
able to organize certain species

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:15,209
determine how they may be related and

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,269
which ones are more closely related than

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,710
others so aerosol system is one of the

8
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,778
first one he developed the first widely

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,118
accepted system this is about two

10
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,219
thousand four hundred years ago there

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,039
are two main groups he divided them into

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,320
plants and animals plants are based on

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,390
the size stem animals based on where

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,179
they lived so if you were a plant did

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,600
you have a soft stem or woody stem or we

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:42,299
like a shrub for animals did you tend to

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,670
live in the air did you live in the

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,250
water or were you and land dweller where

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,070
did you basically live so this is the

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,719
very first of the texts animated way of

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,878
classifying group things so now to name

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,410
organisms biologists use multi-level

23
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,750
grouping of individuals called

24
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,218
classification so why is it important to

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,680
place things into categories

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,680
well those later groups to be formed

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,670
refer to as genre or similar genus this

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,159
allows us to better organize or see what

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,560
organisms might be closer related for

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,409
comparative purposes so by organizing

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,079
them into seem to regions it can help us

32
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,700
draw conclusions can help us find some

33
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,548
information out we figure out one

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,460
particular on subspecies can help us

35
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:35,100
explain or look for solutions in other

36
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:38,030
regions the invention of the mail system

37
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:41,069
so soft referred to as the father of

38
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,469
taxonomy his basic concept for naming

39
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,478
ranking in hospital classifying

40
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,849
organisms is still in wide use today

41
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,530
each level is included in the level

42
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:52,618
above it level gets increasingly

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,450
specific from Kingdom to species so the

44
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:56,759
kingdom is very broad in this case it's

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,000
like animals here we've got breaking it

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,530
down to mammals and are getting all the

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,989
way down here and you'll notice the

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,239
grizzly bears the species very specific

49
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:10,618
well the grizzly bear pairs in all of

50
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:13,620
the prior levels above it however as you

51
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:16,348
work your way up animals aren't

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,239
that are more distantly related we see

53
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:20,609
here in animals we got dogs who got

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,930
snakes who got Birds of it insects all

55
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,940
considered animals along with the

56
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,920
grizzly bear but in the genus which is

57
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,479
just above the species there's only the

58
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,699
grizzly bear in the black bear very

59
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,459
closely related compared to these other

60
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,289
organisms so you can't leave like a

61
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,549
funnel a group of organisms at a

62
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:38,068
particular level in classification

63
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:40,409
system are called taxon put taxa

64
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:42,419
taxonomy is the branch of biology that

65
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:44,429
identifies the names of the organisms

66
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,369
species again meeting the most specific

67
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,189
here we see Arvin Fox I'm just like the

68
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,469
lab that we did domain is liver is the

69
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:54,060
broadest it contains a lot we worked our

70
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,098
way to kingdom phylum class order family

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,689
genus all the way on the specific

72
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:03,658
species so species names are important

73
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:06,870
organs are named using Latin in such a

74
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:10,229
way that no two have the same name

75
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,959
common names can be very misleading both

76
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:15,899
of these are called dolphin so don't

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,609
this is dolphin the flipper you know the

78
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,750
one you may initially associate with

79
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:23,519
this fish is also called a dolphin so in

80
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,979
this case here is a mammal being called

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,829
a dolphin and here's a fish being called

82
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,138
a dolphin mahi-mahi is what this may

83
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,269
also go by but technically both these

84
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,040
are dolphin we went into this prominent

85
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,530
restaurants you see dolphin on the menu

86
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,620
it's not the mammal it's the mahi-mahi

87
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,598
or the fish species so that can be kind

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,989
of misleading there that's why we use

89
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:49,619
our scientific names because common

90
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,319
names are make poor labels all these and

91
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,439
these are both bears so whether it's a

92
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,719
grizzly bear polar bear koala bear or

93
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,939
black bear they're all bears so we want

94
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,769
to be specific with our names so we know

95
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:06,030
were talking about when we're paying

96
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:08,069
this to others so the modern system each

97
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,840
Kingdom Plantae and Animalia was divided

98
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:11,548
into phylum each file into smaller

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,620
groups called the class classified into

100
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,689
order order divided into families

101
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,239
families right into genus in each chance

102
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,858
to divide into species so again in our

103
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,718
life is Novartis category we take a

104
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,598
subset of that River domain a subset

105
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:27,569
that's kingdom phylum class order family

106
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:31,620
genus and species being them

107
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:33,870
specific so we can see that diagrammed

108
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,670
here with our domain is the broadest

109
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,670
category or kingdom phylum class order

110
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,500
family genus species name is the point

111
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,140
of subspecies where there's individuals

112
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,300
that can break down even more

113
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,490
all of these build on one another and

114
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,500
get more and more specific in this case

115
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,480
we're building it as we go up others as

116
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,810
we go down as we see here

117
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,520
same pattern repeats itself though

118
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,790
kingdom phylum class order family genus

119
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,339
and species the order is important to

120
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,680
know so how do we try to memorize that

121
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,750
we get a new on ik device domain is the

122
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,340
broadest category kingdom a little bit

123
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,350
more specific down the phylum class

124
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,419
order family genus and species could

125
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,840
have subspecies so if you wanna come up

126
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,270
with your own kind of pictures here with

127
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,839
just the letters one example is does

128
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:24,870
King Phillip come over for grape soda

129
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,649
domain kingdom phylum class order family

130
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,240
genus and species and the fun gets

131
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,739
smaller here indicating it's hitting a

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,410
more specific because it's working way

133
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,889
down the funnel so that pneumonic device

134
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,970
may help you so what does species we're

135
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,439
talking about we're going the way down

136
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,350
to the species level so approach to

137
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,939
define what a species actually is well a

138
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,700
species is a group of individuals that

139
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:49,680
can breed with one another and produce

140
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,170
fertile offspring that and is very

141
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,110
important because a horse and a donkey

142
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:59,610
produce a mule but the mule cannot

143
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:03,420
produce fertile offspring so the reason

144
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:07,230
being horse has basically its gametes

145
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:10,319
divided you know 64 is deployed 60 to

146
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:14,280
donkey a mule through the combination of

147
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,889
these produces 63 which means it can't

148
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,669
produce gametes because it already has

149
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:23,039
an odd number so when you have a horse

150
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,069
and a donkey crossed together you can

151
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,700
get a mule and this is evidence when the

152
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:32,490
horse is the female and the donkey is

153
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,099
the male when that street roles are

154
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,290
reversed in the horse here again is the

155
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,510
male and the donkeys the female is

156
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,400
Nicola honey

157
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,589
horse bred at the horse horse

158
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,810
the donkey again a donkey but it's

159
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,549
important that in order to get a mule to

160
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,780
begin with even though they aren't

161
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,270
technically a species because they're

162
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,519
sterile the horse needs to be a female

163
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,948
and the donkey needs to be a male and I

164
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,629
take it a mule the henna is the opposite

165
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,830
when the horse is the male and the

166
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:03,269
donkey is the female interesting looks

167
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:05,069
can be deceiving so we're looking the

168
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:07,529
basic things I'm phenotype we have to be

169
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:10,019
very careful the willow wobbler and the

170
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:13,529
sheriff are almost identical in

171
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,698
appearance but do not interbreed so in

172
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,079
this she had a quick look to us that

173
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,410
these pictures look very similar but

174
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:22,740
they're actually very different so

175
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,169
what's the species was about 1.5 million

176
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,970
species that have been named how however

177
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,099
scientists estimate that at least 10

178
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,750
million species exist and at least

179
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,419
two-thirds of these occur in the tropics

180
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,959
so we see our world map encoded for

181
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:39,810
density other vertebrates species most a

182
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,849
lot dense here in this region this is

183
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,668
there's a very distinctive line here

184
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,930
with like all of a sudden nothing do you

185
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:47,668
know anything about this northern region

186
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,189
of Africa a lot of desert not very

187
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,799
conducive here a tropical rainforest

188
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:54,478
here we have a much moderate climate

189
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,788
very warm and that's what's allowing

190
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,990
these species to occur such a high

191
00:07:56,788 --> 00:08:02,189
number our extinction rate versus our

192
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,720
number of species

193
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,538
there's an equilibrium that will adjust

194
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,220
this is true for all environments if you

195
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:09,779
know it may shift slightly there's

196
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,090
always give me that convergence point of

197
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:16,409
the extinction rate in the new species

198
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:18,750
rate so they're our last little

199
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,150
comparison here of classifying hierarchy

200
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,910
of organisms tecsound split species into

201
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:25,529
subsets called varieties peaches and

202
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,860
nectarines are different varieties of

203
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:30,388
the peach tree so main difference is the

204
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,550
presence of fuzz and the skin and

205
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,158
disease resistance peaches

206
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,199
pitted here are more disease-resistant

207
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,059
and have fuzz and the nectarines are

208
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,310
actually a little less resistant disease

209
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,228
resistant and are that's very smooth

210
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,359
kind of shiny texture blue as it looks

211
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,879
here these are called subsets or

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,039
varieties these are different varieties

213
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,379
of the peach tree so again these are

214
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,250
going to share a lot of similarities but

215
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,948
there's also some of those slight

216
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,360
differences the presence of

217
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:59,088
doesn't necessarily mean that it's

218
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,730
disease resistance if something's fuzzy

219
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,680
doesn't mean more disease-resistant but

220
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,509
in this case with peaches they're

221
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,028
evident by that fuzz and they also have

222
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:10,129
slightly more seeds resistance to them

223
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:12,049
versus a nectarine they're that shiner

224
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:14,209
kind of cooked to it and a little less

225
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,889
disease resistant hopefully they helped

226
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,938
explain some of the taxonomy and

227
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,938
classification of organisms
