1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,278
this debacco University video we're

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,560
going to go onsite at the CBG guru's uh

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,960
establishment here to see their soil

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:14,480
preparation and also their planting and

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,480
see the methods they imply to grow their

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,719
[Music]

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,199
hemp so it's great to allow for sea and

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,960
Jacob to allow me out on their field and

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,519
hopefully teach you a little bit about

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,120
what they do um in their uh hemp

11
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,920
production so first off who are they uh

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,640
well we've got Sean here we've got Jacob

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,280
of the CBG gurus their go goal is to

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,320
produce quality product um manufactured

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,520
in stability and alignment with nature

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,359
they use as we'll see a layer of wood

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,039
chips uh to help uh maintain and improve

18
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,558
soil structure and quality and they also

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,960
work with Korean natural farming methods

20
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,839
and this kind of idea and concept is to

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,000
kind of use kind of some of the modern

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,440
science allowing for sustainable and

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,359
abundant cultivation of crops worldwide

24
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,200
so this can be applied more to than just

25
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,879
hemp provide some of their contact

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,759
information here and their website if

27
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:13,239
you want to take a look at them further

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,560
uh that microbial solution they're using

29
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,079
and we'll hear a little bit about that

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
described it's called the jadam

31
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,759
microbial solution or abbreviated JMS

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,840
and that's looking at bringing back

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,640
bring farming back to Farmers restoring

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,759
Farmers sovereignty and Technology speed

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,840
up the ultra lowcost farming and

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,640
ultimately open new world where Farmers

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,719
consumers and Mother Nature are all in

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,079
harmony provide some good links here if

39
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,399
you want to take a look at it a little

40
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,919
bit further as well as the basic recipe

41
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,719
here um so you can get a little bit of

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
an idea if you want to explore that

43
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,679
further take a look at these information

44
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,199
provided here as well as in the

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,439
description but let's go out to the

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,040
field and see exactly uh Sean and Jacob

47
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,039
in action at the CBG

48
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:01,319
gurus as we uh we prepare our field uh

49
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,680
with cardboard which decomposes first

50
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,438
and kills the sod covered in wood chips

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,560
which will decompose second um kind of

52
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,758
over time we get this really rich

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,800
organic matter heavy and kind of very

54
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:17,518
worm casting heavy uh top soil and you

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,480
can see if I hunt through a little bit

56
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm sure we'll find some

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,200
worms right there's

58
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,199
one

59
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,759
so yeah we're trying to disturb them as

60
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,359
little as possible ideally um but that's

61
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,840
one of the big advantages to like the

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,319
back to eeden style farming um is over

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,920
time you're building really really

64
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:44,199
organic matter Rich top soil and really

65
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,119
like helping the worm population grow um

66
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:50,318
a lot of other like microbes and and

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
insects as well

68
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,759
so see

69
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm excited as time progresses all

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,560
really turns into that

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,439
rich top soy like it's only been 3 years

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,878
um at this

73
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,878
point I think this is probably an old

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
row

75
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,120
we had some really crazy increases in

76
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,438
organic matter um from our first year to

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,400
the second year doing the Back to Eden

78
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,400
style um and it was

79
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,400
like more than more than like I think it

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,000
was like two

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,879
2.3% organic matter increase um in the

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,639
soil

83
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:01,199
um and with a cardboard that we used to

84
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,158
kill the sad we kind of uh

85
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,479
figured that like and it seemed as we

86
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,078
were preparing the holes the sad

87
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,479
decomposes really quickly because it's

88
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,079
still pretty alive has some nitrogen

89
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,479
stored in it um and that gives you like

90
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:22,560
an immediate kind of boost so if you do

91
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:22,560
have like grass you know lawn or um hay

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,360
field can work quite

93
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,639
well

94
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,639
so the jadam microbial solution um which

95
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,038
is really incredible for soil building

96
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,160
and just like soil Health in your lower

97
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,279
soil layers and the Anor robic layers um

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,000
one thing we

99
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,439
learned at a from Young Sun Cho at his

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,199
he's the founder of jadam um is that the

101
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,000
only the top two inches or so of your

102
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,680
soil is actually an aerobic environment

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,160
so under that is really Anor robic um

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,478
and a lot of like you're know the miza

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,919
can thrive in a system like ours with

106
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,399
all the wood chips available for them to

107
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,719
eat

108
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,918
but um it's also really important for

109
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,759
soil Health to have your Anor robic

110
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,959
microbes deep down in the soil breaking

111
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:19,400
apart those minerals and rocks and

112
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:23,839
everything so uh he created a recipe

113
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:26,679
just using boiled potatoes uh salt water

114
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:30,159
and then some soil leaf mold um you can

115
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,478
look it up online the JMS uh jadam or

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,080
the jadam microbial solution

117
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:40,000
um and you let it ferment in like a

118
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:43,478
bucket or a barrel a tank

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,839
um for about you know 24 to 36 hours

120
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:47,758
watching as these kind of rings of

121
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,879
bubbles accumulate on top and once they

122
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,600
are kind of concentric circles in the

123
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:56,918
tank you can dilute it with water and uh

124
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,120
pour it over your whole field um and you

125
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,879
can do it when they're plants in the

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,519
ground but it's a great soil soil prep

127
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,159
um and soil building Technique we heard

128
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,198
we uh heard Preston Smith speak about

129
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,599
how he built 2 in of top soil in 3

130
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,439
months using just jadam microbial

131
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:17,199
solution and wood chips um cuz there's

132
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:21,038
just such a it's just such an efficient

133
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,598
way of fermenting indigenous microbes

134
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,639
um that you could really just get like

135
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:29,120
insane levels of decomposition so it's

136
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,280
really amazing too for like remediation

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,800
can be done totally

138
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,839
cheaply uh pretty easily anywhere in the

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,079
world

140
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,079
so pretty

141
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,730
[Applause]

142
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:08,118
amazing

143
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:08,119
[Applause]

144
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
t

145
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,879
yeah so Sean has drilled with the auger

146
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,598
these nice uh deep holes hopefully about

147
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,120
like 2 and 1/2 ft or so deep um and then

148
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,639
I'm going to come back in with the

149
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,000
Pitchfork and uh so the holes are about

150
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,960
8 in wide I'm just going to stick the

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,120
Pitchfork about 45° on the edge of the

152
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,120
holes kick it down and really just try

153
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,840
to loosen up some of that soil down

154
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,478
there on each on all four corners all

155
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,038
four sides so I'll go around it like

156
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,478
that

157
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,719
um really trying to get like underneath

158
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:11,758
the wood chips and not really pull any

159
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,199
of the wood chips into the hole um so

160
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,080
they don't sap any of the nutrients any

161
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,800
the

162
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,120
nitrogen

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,120
so then once I kind of get around it I

164
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,280
want to go back in and really loosen

165
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
that soil

166
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,478
up uh with the

167
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,240
Pitchfork

168
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:33,240
and see

169
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,038
it's pretty nice big loose hole Little

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,038
Rock in there so a lot of

171
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,319
[Applause]

172
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,200
[Applause]

173
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
worms

174
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,719
[Applause]

175
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,639
ready to

176
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,838
go looks

177
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,319
nice got the dunk

178
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,920
Bucket over here so we make made a big

179
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:28,120
concoction of uh the base of it was the

180
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:31,599
Korean natural farming um seed soak

181
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,078
solution um so it's the the base four

182
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,000
parts

183
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,278
um which okay I could try I can think I

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,440
can

185
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:44,200
uh remember what we got going on here in

186
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,600
this bucket so we have the um the bone

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,240
Char in vinegar uh which is water

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,839
soluble uh calcium um in addition to

189
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,440
some vinegar as like a cleanser um and

190
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,160
to to

191
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,640
um pH balance has some has a scobby in

192
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,360
it too as well um so some microbes um

193
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,360
then there's the food element which is

194
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,839
the fermented plant juice which we just

195
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,399
extract from fresh live local uh foraged

196
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:17,320
plants with uh like a raw sugar we use

197
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,919
demarara sugar um and then finally the

198
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,839
last component is the Oriental herbal

199
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,078
nutrient which is a tincture of the five

200
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:28,120
Chinese medicinal herbs so we had

201
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:30,239
licorish um ginger garlic um Angelica

202
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,159
and

203
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,879
cinnamon um tinctured with uh vodka two

204
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,120
parts and jelica um and you keep them

205
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,360
separate but when you do a dunk or spray

206
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,720
or mix it up and dilute it um you

207
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,759
combine them together um or you can

208
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,120
combine them you know for about a month

209
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:52,278
ideally before um that's what uh Master

210
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,879
Cho says so um we

211
00:10:52,278 --> 00:11:00,078
have some other beneficial microbes we

212
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,958
got like a biota from uh biosafe systems

213
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,199
who's nice organic company out of

214
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,000
Connecticut that does like IPM

215
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,399
Solutions

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,200
um and a couple other like microbial

217
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,200
things mixed in

218
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:20,679
there the air pruning on the sides I

219
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,159
think those nice thing maybe um and

220
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,078
they're just a little bigger so they the

221
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,838
plants uh and deeper that's the other

222
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:31,000
thing that we found with like the 5in

223
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,800
versus the 4in pots um the depth U just

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,839
like really stunted the growth they were

225
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,679
grown together for like two two and a

226
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,959
half weeks but then by week three like

227
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,638
you could see the tap rout would hit the

228
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,799
bottom of the small pot and then it

229
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,759
would like slow down whereas like the

230
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,319
other one keep sending that tap rout so

231
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,679
I think the deeper the pot

232
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,720
um the more

233
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,519
ideal but yeah so we're going to take

234
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,079
this plant here with the

235
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,959
flip loosen that pot up slide right out

236
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,479
you can see here

237
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,719
the like root growth is perfect on these

238
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,720
cuz they're not wrapping around the pot

239
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,120
they're going straight down um and

240
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,720
they're looking pretty white and

241
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,560
nice so I'm just going to take her

242
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,720
and dip her in here for a couple seconds

243
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,719
get

244
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,879
some

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,879
and There She

246
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,159
Goes what a beauty sour Tangy number

247
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,319
three I really like we love these big

248
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:44,759
pots they're

249
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,440
rocking the plant just grows so fast it

250
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,120
it

251
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,600
uh especially these clones we've got

252
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,879
definitely some good genetics this one

253
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,959
was

254
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:59,720
uh some very tall tall plants very

255
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,159
quickly and I'm just going to wrap W up

256
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,160
around here give a little wood chip

257
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,159
mulch

258
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,920
in a little circle around

259
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,440
her to try to keep the wood chips a

260
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,958
little bit away from the beast but she's

261
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,240
also pretty big

262
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,518
so don't really have to worry about that

263
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,519
nice and

264
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,919
Woody

265
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:48,600
o bag him and tag him that's it that

266
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,599
Tang number

267
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,278
three
