1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,649
this is going to be a brief overview of

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,059
inner gimmick hydroponic production so

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,669
there's also some vape taking organics

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,638
inorganics the key part is whether using

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,900
organics or in organics fertilizing

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,449
plants tend to do a lot better than

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,859
those that are unfertilized especially

8
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,829
with hydroponic production we're pretty

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,060
much growing in a water-based solution

10
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:22,768
choosing what nutrients to add are very

11
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,899
important and you can use a combination

12
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,479
of both inorganic and organic for a

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,939
quality and product specifically though

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,820
in organics the advantage is especially

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,100
towards newer growers who should start

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,329
with this type of idea I want to start

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,429
with organics where that adds a lot of

18
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,320
complexity new growers should start with

19
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,988
in organics because it tends to be a

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,289
more stable product you're able to look

21
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,689
at measure and see results that are a

22
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,629
little bit more consistent organics can

23
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,640
cause some changes incandescent variable

24
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:56,670
plant availability aspects so if you're

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,230
brand new to growing it's not unwise to

26
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,780
start with in organics because it can

27
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,279
offer you that consistency and it'll be

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,109
able to learn the plans and then slowly

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,900
incorporate more organics if you would

30
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,069
like to into your operation often in

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,719
organic fertilizers or more quickly

32
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,209
plant available so something to keep in

33
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,650
mind if you are switching back and forth

34
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:16,169
as a result this can allow growers to

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,270
correct potential issues fast so even if

36
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,530
you are in organic grower you're having

37
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,319
an issue you may want to grab an

38
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,299
inorganic fertilizer to help speed that

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,669
or correct that problem that you're

40
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,380
noticing quickly for both the new and

41
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,540
experienced growers consistency can

42
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,699
offer many benefits this is one of the

43
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,680
advantages to inorganic fertilizers

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,540
being able to develop a feeding plan can

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,900
help increase the odds of success and

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,368
you could run plants on just the right

47
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,930
amount of nutrients keep a-movin dialed

48
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,780
in keeping that kind of everything

49
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,579
focused and very consistent can result

50
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,579
in very high yields
