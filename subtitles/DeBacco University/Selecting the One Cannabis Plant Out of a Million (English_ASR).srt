1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,199
so welcome to this debaco university

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,720
video

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,399
here we're gonna be looking at selecting

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,160
the one cannabis plant

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,719
out of a million kind of like playing

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,439
the lottery here finding that one unique

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,279
individual

8
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,439
that would be warranted for going

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,399
through the process maybe of propagating

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,920
and cloning

11
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,519
and breeding out further so realize that

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,560
with plants there's some genetic

13
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,839
and inherent genetic variability when

14
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,038
growing a population of plants there's

15
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,039
some that

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,640
sometimes just one just stands out now

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,279
what causes that plant to stand out may

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
be

19
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,439
different for different growers that

20
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,920
stand out is basically at the discretion

21
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,359
of the grower standouts could be the

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
morphology is it a tall or

23
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,759
short plant does it produce a lot of cbd

24
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,519
or cbg for cannabinoids what type of

25
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,119
terpene profile does it have these are

26
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
things to consider as well as

27
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,038
the time that it flowers is it earlier

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
late flower does it does plant tend to

29
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
yield a lot of quantity

30
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
or is it a plant that is producing a lot

31
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,479
of quality

32
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,679
does it need a lot of pruning and is it

33
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,919
resistant to diseases

34
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,198
and if so which ones these are just some

35
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,320
topics we'll be covering

36
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,560
here in this video now the morphology is

37
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,639
the first one so keep in mind morphology

38
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,320
is looking at the structure of the plant

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
and tall plants be better suited for

40
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,879
larger yields per plant

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,118
while shorter plants are more

42
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,920
advantageous for the indoor market so a

43
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,000
lot of

44
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,439
growers may be breeding for those that

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,040
are growing in grow tents

46
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,879
that's a targeted audience so that could

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
be advantageous

48
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,920
internode spacing is what should be

49
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,639
measured and that's the space between

50
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,079
nodes

51
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
tighter internode spacing means it's

52
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,919
going to be a more compact plant

53
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
and greater internet spacing means it's

54
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
going to be a taller plant

55
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,118
however when you get those tight compact

56
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,359
plants that can also increase the

57
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,399
density and also increase the potential

58
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,200
for diseases or

59
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,280
insects to kind of hide within the plant

60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,640
then there's the cannabinoids so thc and

61
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
cbd are what it's commonly

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,000
selected for but some breeders are

63
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,439
looking now into developing strains that

64
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
have greater concentrations of other

65
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,478
cannabinoids

66
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,759
in particular breeding for cbg has

67
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,478
gained some interest

68
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,840
for its potential uses so just another

69
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,679
consideration there

70
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
that just goes beyond the thc and the

71
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
cbd when we're looking at breeding and

72
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,439
finding a genetic standout addition

73
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,119
there's terpenes

74
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,639
so the now the cannabinoids important

75
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
but the effects of a given

76
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,919
product are receiving more attention

77
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,759
breeding for and selecting a unique

78
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,079
terpene profile can make a strain stand

79
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,799
out

80
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
and be sought after the difficult part

81
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
is that the terpene profiles can be

82
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,359
associated

83
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,199
with taste and effects which are going

84
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
to be interpreted differently

85
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,719
by different people this is why

86
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
typically the cannabinoids

87
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,479
and the percentage of those is given a

88
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,159
little bit more weight or a little bit

89
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,759
more kind of favoritism than the

90
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,598
terpenes because that's kind of flavors

91
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,120
what one person may like another person

92
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,079
may not like

93
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
then the flowering time so this can

94
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,440
relate to when

95
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
pre-flowers are first seen or when an

96
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,479
autoflower actually starts to get into

97
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,919
the flowering phase

98
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,518
early flowering can help reduce the

99
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,958
duration needed to complete the growth

100
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
cycle so that can be important for

101
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,680
growers

102
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
getting more generations in the same

103
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
duration of time

104
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,560
and delaying the flower time can

105
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,280
increase the time in the

106
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,878
required vegetative phase and this can

107
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,560
help build a bigger plant structure

108
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,399
which may be advantageous if you're

109
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,519
seeking to breed a high biomass

110
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,039
producing plant

111
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
so again you can see again the pros and

112
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,120
cons with each there

113
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,959
then we get into just general yield you

114
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,080
know how much is the plant

115
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
producing well regarding yields this can

116
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
be related to one of two

117
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
main factors one could be quantity those

118
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,560
are

119
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
for those looking to just the total

120
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,598
amount of plant product

121
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,280
how much product is produced by the

122
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,878
plant then there's also

123
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,199
quality and here the breeders looking

124
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,919
more for at the chemicals and compounds

125
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,158
produced

126
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,839
and not so much the total plant material

127
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,759
of course most growers would like both

128
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
high quality and a lot of and a lot of

129
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,518
product that is of high quality

130
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
but sometimes you may have to select one

131
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,319
over the other

132
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,239
some growers will sacrifice the total

133
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,679
quantity for improved quality

134
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,799
which can be directly related to the

135
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
terpenes produced for example there

136
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,760
then we get to plant behavior and this

137
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,199
is how much you want to fight with the

138
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,518
plant so to speak

139
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,438
how easy is the plant to grow this could

140
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,438
refer to how well the plant

141
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,280
supports itself on its own if it's a

142
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,639
strong plant or does it kind of require

143
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,318
or need staking

144
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,158
also consider how much pruning or what

145
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,878
pruning method might be a good fit for

146
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,439
the plant's

147
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,120
natural style weaker plants that require

148
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,478
staking should be considered more for

149
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,478
indoor applications

150
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,359
compared to those growing outdoor or

151
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,159
those that want to be a little more

152
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
hands-off

153
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,600
and production of their plants then

154
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,000
there is disease

155
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
resistance so this is often overlooked

156
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
but how resistant is a plant

157
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
strain to a certain diseases can be a

158
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
very important

159
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,839
to be bred into genetic lineages

160
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,680
very important trait to consider this

161
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,599
can become obvious in a large growing

162
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,079
area if all plants have a disease but

163
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,879
there is

164
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,560
one that disease quote missed in the

165
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,759
sense that it just simply has resistance

166
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,519
to that

167
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,199
because this doesn't happen like powdery

168
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,959
mildew for example would spread over the

169
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,600
whole area that means that one plant

170
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,638
that isn't

171
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,479
diseased has inherent resistance and

172
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,918
that can be very advantageous to any

173
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,000
breeding program

174
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,918
this can be a very desirable quality it

175
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,879
makes for a great addition to a breeding

176
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,719
program

177
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,959
if you can get some disease resistance

178
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,039
here we see in the images powdery mildew

179
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,079
but there's also bud rot to consider as

180
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,879
well

181
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,599
as well as a host of others different is

182
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,800
not always

183
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
better though so just because you're

184
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
growing a thousand plants and one of

185
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,319
them is different

186
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,000
mutations are often not beneficial but

187
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,439
in the case where they are

188
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
growers should consider propagating that

189
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,918
plant to preserve those genetics

190
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,439
often cloning is suggested to ensure the

191
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,839
exact same genetics are copied

192
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,038
and then multiplied that's just again

193
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,638
important mutations

194
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,000
typically not a good thing but in

195
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,800
certain cases they can be and you want

196
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,478
to make sure you have

197
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,240
methods of preserving recognizing that

198
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,439
number one and then preserving those

199
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
genetics

200
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,199
this is where attention to detail is

201
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
important you want to look carefully at

202
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
all plans keeping good records is an

203
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,119
important part of this process

204
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,199
if you happen to get lucky and find that

205
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,639
unique genetic kind of profile you want

206
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
to be able to capture

207
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
and preserve it and not lose it or lose

208
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,679
track of it

209
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
you want to make sure that you're able

210
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
to take advantage of that unique

211
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,560
situation

212
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,919
because it might be truly that one in a

213
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
million

214
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,519
now that selection process that you may

215
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
go through

216
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,918
can take a long time even longer if you

217
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,359
do not know what you're looking for so

218
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,478
keep that in mind even being very

219
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
selective and targeted

220
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,199
still can take a very long time either

221
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
select a standout plan continue to breed

222
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,879
it and select for

223
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,720
consistent repeatable qualities or

224
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,719
determine what you want to breed for

225
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,240
and then start to select for those

226
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,479
qualities so that's two

227
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,639
different routes you can kind of take

228
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,959
with the breeding process

229
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,478
so again being intentioned to detail

230
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,079
knowing what you're looking for finding

231
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,038
genetic standouts having good cloning

232
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,680
procedures

233
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,519
this is all ways that when you identify

234
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,840
that one in a million you can hopefully

235
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,959
capture that i wish you the best of luck

236
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,038
in this process

237
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,560
if you wish to go down this route

238
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,199
because it can be challenging

239
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,000
and take a lot of time but also very

240
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,478
rewarding in the

241
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,478
end
