1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
if you've considered using biodegradable

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,110
pots for cannabis production

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:15,279
this debaco university video is for you

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:16,240
[Music]

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,239
all right let's go over some

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,959
biodegradable pots uh for canvas

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,239
production

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
let you know some of the options you

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,919
have all right so first off i want you

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,159
to realize that there is some

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
variability with biodegradable pots

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
there's many different types of base

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,079
materials that fall under this category

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
there's common brands materials such as

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,679
for example cow pots

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,719
are made from cow manure jiffy pots are

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,280
made from willpower

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,920
wood pulp and peat moss straw pots are

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
made from

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
as they would imply straw and same with

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,079
coconut fiber also made

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,079
from coconut fiber no real surprise

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
there keep in mind some of these also

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,359
have binders that are added to them to

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,120
help hold them together

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,399
and so for example the coconut coir

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,839
might not be something you're if you're

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,280
used to growing it as a media

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
you're looking at here as a pot it has a

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,558
very kind of

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,679
solid like feel to it there's a binder

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,840
in there so it can be very

33
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,438
thin but still hold together that's

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,719
going to affect some of the properties

35
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,919
of these pots

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,760
now starting with the first one here

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,680
looking at just at cow pots many

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,920
variations to meet different demands

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360
they do break down in one year if used

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,200
in field applications they won't

41
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,519
accumulate over a year they do break

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,280
down over the course of a growing season

43
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,039
but they're not well suited for full

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,159
growing cycle production so what that

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,920
means is if you're growing in a

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
greenhouse or high tunnel

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,439
i'm going to grow in a one of these

48
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,879
containers not the best they tend to

49
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,359
break down over time which is a good

50
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,879
thing

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,280
if you're planting them directly into

52
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,719
the field they said many variations many

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
different sizes

54
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,200
which is great for holding seedlings for

55
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,359
a certain duration of time

56
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
then there are jiffy pots and this

57
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,679
pretty much is considered to be like the

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,520
standard

59
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
however the rate of degradation is

60
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,280
longer than one growing season

61
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,199
if being used in outdoor field

62
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,718
applications so you want to keep in mind

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,359
that this will result in overall

64
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,839
accumulation of the material if you use

65
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,159
it year after year in the same field

66
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,840
so while yes does it break down yes but

67
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,399
it does take longer than a year

68
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,640
so keep that in mind then there are

69
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,000
straw pots that are made from straw

70
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,598
and they do break down quickly but

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
they're not well suited for long-term

72
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,039
growing

73
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,800
they can be very flimsy side when it

74
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,598
comes to handling and transport of the

75
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,760
plants

76
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,119
while in these containers and basically

77
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,679
start wrapped together there's a binder

78
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
there

79
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,439
roots can penetrate through them pretty

80
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,439
easily but they are not really

81
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,598
have a great integrity uh to them so

82
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,199
they can fall apart fairly easily

83
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,839
then there's those coconut pots here

84
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,439
this last one that we'll talk about here

85
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,759
roots can often pass right through the

86
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,000
fibers as we see here on the lower side

87
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,679
however if used in outdoor locations

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,759
these pods really do not break down very

89
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,920
much at the end of the season

90
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,679
so feel as if they can almost be reused

91
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,439
to the lack of degradation

92
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
so while they you know are toted as you

93
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,479
know being great and reusable using

94
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,399
material

95
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,000
if you're planting them outdoors you

96
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
want to be mindful that at the end of

97
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,598
the season you may be able to find

98
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,639
basically the same pot originally

99
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,039
planted

100
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,039
so keep that in mind so you don't have

101
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,439
these containers becoming

102
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,878
a potential problem particularly in

103
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,878
field applications
