00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
this tobacco university video is going

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,799
to look at calcium and magnesium

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,679
and its importance in plants and these

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,320
are nutrients

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
typically reported in a soil test report

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,920
so you should have some understanding

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,920
of how they impact plants

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,800
so here we'll look at calcium and

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
magnesium importance in a soil test

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,679
report

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,359
now we notice that it's often marketed

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,238
here as bone health for

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
humans but also calcium magnesium are

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,599
also important

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,479
for our plants health as well so first

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,039
off starting with

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,959
calcium so for calcium it's a vital

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,839
component of the cell manufacturing

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,878
process

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,239
calcium also improves the root uptake of

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,960
other nutrients

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,679
plants growing points are particularly

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,558
sensitive

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,679
to an insufficient calcium supply as

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,479
evident by blossom

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,000
enrot those black sunken spots are often

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,519
discovered at the bottom of tomatoes and

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
summer squash here

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,840
indicate that these plants were not

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
getting adequate levels of calcium

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
also lack of moisture can contribute to

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
this disorder

33
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,000
and soils that are proper are properly

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,000
limed

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
generally contain adequate calcium

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
levels because this nutrient is a major

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
constitute of limestone

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
however if you're dependent on that lime

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
for your calcium

40
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,199
be aware that some of that calcium while

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
in high amounts

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
may not be necessarily always plant

43
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,199
available

44
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,559
it can occur in other crops as well here

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,560
we see the grapes now if we're talking

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
about crops that don't produce an actual

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
fruit

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,118
because this is looking at the actively

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,879
growing points

50
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,879
typically you're going to see calcium

51
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,118
issues at kind of the tips

52
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,879
of plants maybe the browning or the

53
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,040
burning of the tips of plants

54
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,798
can be another indication that your

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,280
plants might be deficient

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,520
in calcium going on to magnesium here

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,118
and magnesium is a key element in in the

58
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,879
development of chlorophyll

59
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:03,280
magnesium breviate mg is a crucial

60
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,879
for seed formation like calcium

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,478
magnesium is usually supplied by

62
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,038
limiting materials particularly

63
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,318
dolomic lime because dolomitic limestone

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,479
contains about 20

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,159
magnesium so not only are you getting a

66
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,159
ph change

67
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,439
making your soil that might be too

68
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,039
acidic more basic

69
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,439
you're also getting magnesium with that

70
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,120
product epsom salts or magnesium sulfate

71
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,039
may be recommended where calcium and

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,000
soil ph levels are adequate

73
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,039
but soil magnesium is still low now when

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
i say

75
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,159
chlorophyll development we can see here

76
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,239
that the yellow

77
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,199
the yellow coloration of the leaves here

78
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,959
it's a tomato

79
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,318
but look would we look very similar in

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,719
other crops for

81
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,079
the magnesium deficiency this is kind of

82
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,439
very characteristic

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
you can see it'd not be every leaf but

84
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,439
we can see it's definitely evident here

85
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,519
the main veins of the leaf are still

86
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,759
green in the in between veins the

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
intervenal areas is what yellows

88
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,799
and that's a classic symbol of a

89
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
magnesium deficiency

90
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,200
particularly if it occurs on the older

91
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,199
or the lower leaves within a plant

92
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,399
that can be an indication that you may

93
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,839
be looking at a plant

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
that is magnesium deficient
