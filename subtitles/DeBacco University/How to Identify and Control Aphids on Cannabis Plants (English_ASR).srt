1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,200
going to go over how to identify and

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
control aphids

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,800
as well as the end you'll get to see

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,718
some actual video footage

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
where i was able to sadly find some

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,919
aphids on some plants

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,920
you get to see actually how they look on

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
cannabis

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,880
[Music]

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,879
all right let's get into how to identify

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,879
and control aphids on cannabis plants

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,439
and we can see in the image here

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,320
the plethora of aphids sadly on the

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,119
underside

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,880
some will be very small some larger all

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,959
these though piercing sucking insects

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,840
going to do severe damage to your plants

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,079
as well as

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,520
could also transmit diseases such as

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,039
viruses

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
so if it's what's the general

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,439
description of aphids well most of the

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,519
time

25
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,039
aphids are wingless but in the spring

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
and fall aphids can have wings to

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
increase

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
their dispersal so they can kind of

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,198
spread and jump from one plant to

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,120
another

31
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,558
these are small insects that can be

32
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,198
found in large numbers

33
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,320
and can also be found in clusters so you

34
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,519
might go through an area where you don't

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,198
find any don't find anything you get

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,880
like a little hot spot

37
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,200
at least in the initial point of

38
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,560
development this is the wingless form

39
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,280
of the aphids here they can be green to

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,478
whiter to kind of like a brownish

41
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,118
tannish kind of color

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,560
a little black stripe so there are some

43
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,319
variants that does occur

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,759
these are the eggs of cannabis aphids

45
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,919
laid in late september

46
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,000
we can see here that kind of everything

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
from that green to that kind of almost

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,799
see-through green to that dark

49
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
coloration there

50
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,118
so there are some variables there keep

51
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,959
in mind that normally females

52
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,640
are present which gives a live birth to

53
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,359
genetically identical daughters

54
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,960
it's almost like they're kind of like

55
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,200
giving birth to

56
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,239
the genetically identical so they can be

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,079
literally born

58
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,679
pregnant kind of a weird feature to

59
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,758
aphids and part of the reason

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,920
why they can mass multiply so quickly

61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,000
now the identification of aphids on

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,478
cannabis plants is that they can produce

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,560
a

64
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,159
honeydew or a sugary secretion which

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,478
often turns black

66
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,280
with the growth of a kind of city mold

67
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,359
fungus

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,199
some aphid species inject a toxin into

69
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,800
the plants which causes leaves to curl

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,759
and further distorts growth

71
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
as well as can transmit viruses we can

72
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,919
see just here a mixture of the winged

73
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
and wingless

74
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,318
cannabis aphids most of the wingless

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,719
aphids are in the immature stage

76
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,839
and here we have these little white dots

77
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,719
these are what we call

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,319
cast skins of cannabis aphids and these

79
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,919
are shed in the aphid mulch to a new

80
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,119
larger stage and often collect on the

81
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,039
leaves below colony

82
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
can be an indication that aphids are

83
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,359
nearby

84
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,280
so i would go about managing aphids well

85
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000
uh reflective or silver mulch can be

86
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,719
added

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,239
to not allow the aphids to easily detect

88
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,239
the underside of the leaves

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,840
that kind of reflective mulch allows it

90
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,759
to kind of like look like the sun

91
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
aphids get confused and will reduce

92
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,959
their pest pressure

93
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
garlic sprays can help repel them from

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
initially entering an area

95
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,238
as well as the utilization of beneficial

96
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,879
insects such as green lacewings and lady

97
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,439
beetles

98
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,079
can be effective if they are established

99
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,400
early

100
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,879
here we see some aphids and we see the

101
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
ladybug larva feeding on aphids

102
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,318
here we also see the um tiny wasp which

103
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
can

104
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,958
uh parasitize certain aphids and we can

105
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,719
see what it looks like at the kind of

106
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,640
mummy stage there

107
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,479
so as a kind of ways of control how do

108
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,158
they actually look on a plant

109
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,079
well i'm going to take you out to an

110
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:28,079
actual plant and show you

111
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,159
just how aphids look on a cannabis plant

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
now here we see some anthocyanins being

113
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,039
produced and it's a coloration to

114
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
some of the small leaflets near this bud

115
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
so just as for comparison

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,199
here we're seeing some of those

117
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,120
anthocyanins being produced that kind of

118
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,399
purple coloration in this case

119
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,080
a lot of times it can be response to

120
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
stress early on that could be water

121
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
stress it could be light stress

122
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,079
well kind of the stress going on here is

123
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,518
evident on the underside of the leaves

124
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,920
you look at the underside of the leaves

125
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,719
here in particular sadly we're seeing a

126
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,679
lot of

127
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,158
aphids on that underside of the leaves

128
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
so

129
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,560
these aphids are piercing sucking insect

130
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
and they're causing a water stress

131
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,318
on the plant and you never really find

132
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,639
just one

133
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,399
there's usually many of them and we can

134
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,598
see that clearly evident here so

135
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
something we want to be looking at

136
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,279
controlling

137
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,560
early on and scouting for so we don't

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,000
get into issues

139
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,360
like this where we have a lot of insects

140
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,918
kind of reducing

141
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
the plant performance and ultimately

142
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,000
cell they're going to reduce the blood

143
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,519
quality

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,639
i think just looking at that blood there

145
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,079
kind of speaks volumes when you're

146
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,280
looking at not really having the

147
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,918
greatest amount

148
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,799
of cannabinoids or terpenes that are

149
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,879
going to be produced

150
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,879
overall yield considering the effort

151
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,839
that went into producing a plant

152
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,839
of this size
