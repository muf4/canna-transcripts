1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
this is a video you've all been waiting

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,519
for here in debaco university i'm going

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,559
to walk you through the real difference

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,160
between an indica and sativa plants i'm

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,480
going to show you with examples and i

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,480
hope you enjoy

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,760
[Music]

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,118
so many people ask about the difference

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,599
between a sativa

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,160
and an indica now a lot of that talk

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,599
occurs at a bud tender shop uh that's

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,118
really not the conversation needs to

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,280
occur where the camera relationship

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,039
needs to occur is here at a growing area

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,160
and in front of me here would be what's

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,079
called a sativa dominant type plant now

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,679
what makes it sativa dominant there's no

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,840
buds on here how can we tell we don't

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,759
know necessarily the chemical profile

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,000
really the sativa indica is based on the

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,238
morphology of the plant and this one

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,878
here expressing strong

23
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,399
sativa dominant characteristics so what

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,599
are those characteristics well it's the

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,759
tallness

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
look at the leaf

27
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,280
very thin

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,679
very wispy this is a plant that's going

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,439
to get very tall this is indication of

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,920
your true sativa morphologies and that's

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,399
really describing how the plant looks

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
and how the plant behaves not

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
necessarily the chemical profile that a

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,280
lot of people associate with is sativa

35
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,199
or an indica so this is sativa now let's

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
go take a look at an indica dominant

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
variety

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
so here in front of me we're looking at

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
an indica dominant variety and what does

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
that make it different than the sativa

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,759
we just saw again here's that sativa

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,359
leaf getting a little wilty but we can

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
see that very thin

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,799
kind of leaf morphology well the indica

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,560
will be very different

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
here is an indica

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,118
on say much fatter leaf a lunch wider

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,399
leaf a much shorter plant you'll notice

49
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,159
tends to be a little squattier it can

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,719
still get tall still photoperiod

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,880
dependent but the indica sativa debate

52
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,879
that we hear uh different effects that

53
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,359
the plants produce really isn't the true

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,920
case we really that really does impact

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,959
the morphology of how that plant looks

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
which is far a cry from what we see

57
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,359
discussed in bud shops we're talking

58
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,919
about chemical profiles and effects

59
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,840
sativa indica really has to do with only

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,079
the morphological differences that we

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,039
can clearly see with these two different

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
types

63
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,079
and here on the left we can clearly see

64
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:23,039
the indica dominant variety

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,200
by its wider leaf morphology

66
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,439
and then here on the right hand side we

67
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,719
can clearly see a sativa because it's

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,280
much thinner

69
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,800
leaf morphology so again nothing to do

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
with what you hear in grow shops nothing

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
to hear what you hear in blood tenders

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
it all has to do with the morphology or

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,640
the physical structure

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,640
of the plant
