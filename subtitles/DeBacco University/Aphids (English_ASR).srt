1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
yeah I'm going to discuss a very

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,540
destructive plant insect called a

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:08,339
schvitz now while it may be small in

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,259
size with a lack in size they definitely

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,349
make can make a poor in numbers in

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,939
disruption so first off identifying what

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,528
you have is important so for an

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,719
indication of aphids well they are very

9
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,339
small you can see here looking at a

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,079
canvas plant how small they look in

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,329
comparison the cone was like a little

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,919
white dust covering the plants what

13
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,959
allows them to kind of mass multiply is

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,480
a little scary sometimes here is that

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,250
they can be born pregnant so we can have

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,130
an ancient kind of within an aphid

17
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,808
giving rise to Moray fits really causing

18
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,940
their numbers to increase dramatically

19
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,890
not to say they can't lay eggs but this

20
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,289
is one way that they can mass multiply

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,878
they are piercing insects so their

22
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,378
mouthparts are for piercing looking

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,628
specifically at getting into the phloem

24
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,670
which transports the sugars in the plant

25
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:53,099
there are six a third species in

26
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,770
particular that are specifically attack

27
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,289
cannabis plants while there's many other

28
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,850
species six in particular have been

29
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,520
identified to attack cannabis in

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,140
particular now we're to look most adults

31
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,579
do not have wings so you want to look at

32
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,739
the underside of the leaves

33
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,950
typically shy away from areas of bright

34
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,629
light some species prefer older lower

35
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,579
leaves and others prefer younger upper

36
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:16,978
leaves so where you find in the plant

37
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,688
may help identify and identify what

38
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,750
particular type of Av did you have

39
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:24,118
however regardless of what type they all

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,700
follow the same basic pattern they all

41
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,250
have very similar ways that they can

42
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,049
destroy the plant early damage can be a

43
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,359
challenge to detect in part because that

44
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,280
they are so small honey deal will be

45
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,379
excreted from the aphids and this is one

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,170
indicating factor when you are looking

47
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,089
at identifying them now how to prevent a

48
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,530
fence or they can it's important to do

49
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,109
this because it can vector diseases

50
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,710
particularly viruses polio viruses to be

51
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,780
exact

52
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,129
more moist conditions with minimal air

53
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,799
movement will increase the damage

54
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,259
occurred by aphids you want to inspect

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,939
incoming plants for them and avoid high

56
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,439
nitrogen fertilization as this can

57
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,658
promote lush growth that is favorable

58
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,328
for aphids if it's kind of like this

59
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,040
kind of bloated look to leaves and it

60
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:06,569
can easily cause through and in fact

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
that and they do in fact it's

62
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,868
particularly they transmit viruses you

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,640
can get this kind of weird mottled look

64
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,469
to the leaves you can also get this

65
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,000
weird kind of crinkly look to

66
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,430
some of the leaves and other leaves will

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,909
look fine this is very indicative of a

68
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,370
viral infection typically vectored by a

69
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:26,520
fits and what a vector is is just an

70
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,819
intermediate that can transport certain

71
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,050
diseases to other ultimate hosts here

72
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,349
know how to control them

73
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,570
to common control methods are lady

74
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,379
beetles and green lace wings lady

75
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,789
beetles can be refrigerated and released

76
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,979
when it's advantageous just the grower

77
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:45,870
within reason and releasing them to

78
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,479
evening or early morning near a few

79
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,099
colonies while the vents are closed is a

80
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,469
way to get the maximum effectiveness

81
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,560
from that you may need VP applications

82
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,849
not easily purchased in released so it

83
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,830
makes it great for grower control

84
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,599
another one it can be used for aphids

85
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,730
are green lace wings and they can sprint

86
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,710
larvae over an area because they're

87
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,699
cannibalistic so if you do buy them as

88
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,860
larvae you want to spread them out

89
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,989
because they will eat each other you

90
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,660
wanna look for clean new growth the sign

91
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,340
that Athens has been killed the sense

92
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,930
that you've reduced that population and

93
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,030
the plants not able to produce new

94
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,770
growth again however keep in mind if you

95
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,620
are using these in a greenhouse and it

96
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,240
does get warm above 95 degrees they

97
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,689
typically will leave the greenhouse area

98
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,879
in secret of cooler temperatures so

99
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:32,490
again these are two methods of

100
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,840
biological control for aphids put a

101
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,120
little link down here if you want to

102
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,950
learn a little bit more about Athens and

103
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,509
how to control them and prevent them

104
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:41,509
from damaging your crop
