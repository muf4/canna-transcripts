1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
in this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,480
video we're going to take a look at

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,400
proper fluorescent light settings to use

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,638
for clones we're going to be utilizing a

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,880
par meter so i know many people can't

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,638
justify the expense of a par meter so

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,679
hopefully this video will give you some

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,160
insight

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,920
to know exactly how far and how to set

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,039
up your fluorescent lights so you have a

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,039
successful cloning operation

12
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:31,439
[Music]

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
all right now just before we get into

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
the video here just realize these clones

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
or these plant leaves are about eight

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,239
inches away from the light uh as a

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:44,238
source of comparison and also the light

18
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,919
used was an agro-bright designer t5 324

19
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,199
watt fluorescent light

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,879
was used and that's going that we're

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
going to see because it offers these

22
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,718
great adjustments we're just going to

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,719
see what adjustment works best for our

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,800
operation here with the use of a par

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,079
meter so we've just switched over our

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,319
lights from our led to our fluorescent

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,879
lights this is because the leds were

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,359
providing a bit too high of a par

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
reading for our liking and so we wanted

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,920
to move to something a little less

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,319
intense

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,960
now for this lighting setup we have a

33
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,438
few different options this one has four

34
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,399
of our lights on

35
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,559
this option has all of our lights on

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,478
where this option has just two of our

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
lights on now we need to figure out

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,039
which is the best for our grow operation

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
so we're going to use a par meter to

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
read each of these lighting

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
settings and determine which one is the

42
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,199
best

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,599
right now we're at our lowest light

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,960
setting of just two of our lights on and

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,239
we're reading at a about 104 103 par

46
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,759
meter

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,959
i would recommend that you hold your

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,438
sensor just as a note at plant level

49
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,640
instead of too high or too low just to

50
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,599
make sure that you're getting an

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,680
appropriate reading

52
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,519
now we're at our medium lighting option

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,200
with just two of our lights off and

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,199
we're reading at a good 210 par reading

55
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,439
now we're at our highest setting with

56
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,519
all of our lights on and we're reaching

57
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,598
about

58
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,480
340 for our par rating

59
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,519
based on the size and shape of our clone

60
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,919
so far

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,000
our ideal par reading would be at around

62
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,159
200. now all of the lights on at 300 is

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,719
a little too much but fortunately we

64
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,719
have the option to dim it down by just

65
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,959
turning our middle two lights off to

66
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,959
give us the perfect par reading of about

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,959
200.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
you
