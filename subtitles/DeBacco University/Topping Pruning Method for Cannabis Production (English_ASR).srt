1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
if you're considering topping your

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,440
cannabis plants and wondered a little

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:16,559
bit more about that method

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:18,320
this tobacco university video is for you

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,719
all right let's get into top topping as

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,719
a pruning method for cannabis production

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,640
so first off what is topping sometimes

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,919
it's called tipping sometimes it's also

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,519
called pinching the plant

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
this kind of shows a great little image

11
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,479
that of that what that looks like

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
there are all forms of pruning each has

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,558
their own preference to

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,399
where a grower will physically choose to

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,640
top or to cut the plant off

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
topping is removing the growing tip from

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
the main stem

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,239
that will give you basically two stems

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
this can be performed multiple times to

20
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,519
get more stems and branches

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
as we see here and typically this is

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,000
done when the plant is

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,359
at four to five nodes or so up so it's

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,079
not done at the very beginning that done

25
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,079
really late

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,198
typically four to five nodes but again

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,640
growers choice

28
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,640
and it can be depending on the growing

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
situation as well as the variety they

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
might be growing

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,599
so how much to top what would you go

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,118
through and how much you go through and

33
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,118
topping we can see that evident right

34
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,959
here see that pinch point we see those

35
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,118
two additional kind of growing points

36
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,719
where there was one now there'll be two

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,159
some growers would simply pinch the tip

38
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,959
of an active and growing portion of the

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,799
plant

40
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,039
others like to take three plus nodes off

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,560
to get the bonus material as a clone

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
if you take a little bit more you can

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,200
take that off you get the pinch point

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
here you're gonna grow into two well

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,079
that cutting you just took off you can

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,079
now go through and clone

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,158
however an additional bonus is the plant

48
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,239
will be larger and slightly more

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,479
developed so it can push out of the

50
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,118
stress a little bit easier than recovery

51
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,959
time

52
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,159
typically if you do it when its plants

53
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,679
is very small if you're removing the

54
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,118
water it's going to produce new leaves

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
that can cause a little bit of a lag

56
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,680
time so that's why some growers prefer

57
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,599
prefer to wait a little bit longer but

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
again up to the growers or growers

59
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,640
choice

60
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,718
so topping an autoflower would that be

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
advised it's strain dependent as there

62
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,640
can be various levels of success

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
typically it's best to top an auto early

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
in life cycle

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,040
this is suggested to be before day 21

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,118
with day 14 kind of being the target

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,319
the fourth node can also provide a good

68
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,919
marker for growers

69
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,159
genetics need to be an aggressive grower

70
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,878
to maximize yield particularly if you're

71
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,840
doing this

72
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,359
pruning method with an autoflower now

73
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,719
what's happening in the plants

74
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
well we're having this kind of hormone

75
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,560
shift removing the actively growing tip

76
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,520
removes the concentration of oxen in the

77
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,479
plant taking that tip

78
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,680
off this will auxin reduces lateral

79
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,119
blood formation

80
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
so when you remove the tip you're

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
removing the highest concentration of

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
auxin here

83
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
as we see right here and what that does

84
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,759
is that basically now causes the plant

85
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,239
to grow

86
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,479
lateral branches more aggressively this

87
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,480
is also done a lot with poinsettias

88
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,518
so this removing of the apical meristem

89
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,079
removing that auxin

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,439
will now induce lateral buds to grow

91
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
which is a great thing

92
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,959
now we're going to take a quick look at

93
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
an example of this kind of method of

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
pruning an

95
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
outdoor grown plant a little bit later

96
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,959
in the season

97
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,400
but just to show you kind of what the

98
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,439
plants may look like if you wait a

99
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,360
little bit later

100
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,719
to go through this plant topping method

101
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
hope you enjoy

102
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,158
so many times growers want to know kind

103
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,598
of how does a pruning style affect the

104
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,120
plant particularly getting to the end of

105
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,679
harvest well this is a prime example

106
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
here

107
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
if you look at this plant the apricot

108
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,239
mirror stem was removed

109
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,598
meaning the central stalk was cut was

110
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,719
topped essentially somebody call it

111
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,919
topping their plants

112
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,400
and what we're noticing when we take out

113
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,759
that apical meristem unlike the plant

114
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
over here where we're maintaining the

115
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,518
apical meristem we get one large bud

116
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,439
and the others kind of suffer here we're

117
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
cutting it right here getting side

118
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,000
branching to occur

119
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
so you're moving the ox and it's a plant

120
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
hormone and that will kind of induce

121
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
side branches to form so what's the

122
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
advantage of growing a lot of side

123
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
branches well as you can see

124
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,399
here without that apical meristem now

125
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,400
we're getting a little bit more of a

126
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
consistent harvest on some of the

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
side branches now you're noticing all

128
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,158
the buds still are pointing upwards so

129
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,519
even though this is kind of growing out

130
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,158
in that kind of v y pattern all the buds

131
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
will still

132
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,759
point up the intention is and this is

133
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,479
maybe just a little bit of late here in

134
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,479
the season

135
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,759
but what the intention is to get more

136
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,438
even uh buds

137
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,359
throughout the top here instead of

138
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,598
having just that one central

139
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
main bud now we're getting more buds

140
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,359
that are

141
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,560
larger in size so again just a different

142
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,239
pruning style

143
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,839
but this kind of shows that topping that

144
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
may have occurred sometimes it occurs

145
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,879
by the grower actually cutting it

146
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,638
sometimes in the outdoor environment in

147
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,439
particular the wind may kind of select

148
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,199
that

149
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,879
but this just kind of shows the end

150
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,000
result that you can get

151
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,000
from topping a plane
