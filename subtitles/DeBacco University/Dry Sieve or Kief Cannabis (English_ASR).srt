1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,318
here in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,398
we're going to go over dry sieve or keef

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:17,039
cannabis and try to describe a little

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:18,640
bit about what this actually is

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,240
all right let's go into the description

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,920
here of dry sieve or

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,399
cannabis and try to explain a little bit

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,960
of the process to create this

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,518
so first off this to make this the

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
method

11
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,719
with the plate materials deep frozen

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
prior to

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,558
the sifting process the buds are then

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
placed in a box filled with three sets

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:36,959
of screens with the mesh size getting

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,599
smaller

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,359
with each screen so the bigger mesh is

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
at the top and then the smaller smaller

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,558
mesh gets to the bottom

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
with each screen as the product is

21
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,878
passing through those different screens

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,800
the product is then agitated

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,759
mechanically or by hand by their shaking

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,519
the box or

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,439
to sift or kind of carting the product

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,320
through each screen this forces resin

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,159
glands to fall

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,480
off the product into the individual

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,238
screens all of the filtered

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,079
product is then collected at the bottom

31
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,158
of the box that should be very fine as

32
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,679
we see in the pictures here

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
what's the resulting end product this is

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
kind of a good image the dry

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,478
sif extract produces a fine powder-like

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,200
substance called dry sift or keef

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,359
the if properly refined the resulting

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,159
product can have upwards of 70 percent

39
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,959
cannabinoids as well as all of the

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,040
original

41
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,478
flavors and terpenes from the original

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,560
product so it makes this kind of

43
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,280
advantageous here

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,040
so other advantages of this method are

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
that it has the same smell and taste as

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
original flour used for extraction

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
it does not use any solvents the dry

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
sift is extremely versatile can be

49
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,478
smoked vaporized or rolled

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
easiest extraction method and can be

51
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,799
done on a very low budget

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
however there are some disadvantages in

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,759
the sense that the

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,600
labor and time it takes to produce it

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,920
and it can contain more contaminants

56
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,640
than solvent-based methods so keep that

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,640
in mind

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
just looking at the image here looking

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
at slightly the person's hands

60
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
and the cleanness of the hands that also

61
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,759
drawn to question

62
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,039
the potential to use that product so

63
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,519
just keep that in mind

64
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
and this hopefully very simple method

65
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,758
again can be something that can be

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
easily utilized

67
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,318
but again even this has its drawbacks

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,239
compared to some of the other methods

69
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,439
so take a look at the tobacco university

70
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,480
channel hopefully you can find an

71
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:23,280
extraction method

72
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,280
that's the best fit for your situation
