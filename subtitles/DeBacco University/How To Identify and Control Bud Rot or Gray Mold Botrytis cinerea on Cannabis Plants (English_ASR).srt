1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,600
on this debaco university video i'll

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,919
show you

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,878
what bud rot or gray mold also called

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,039
botrytis

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,119
looks like on cannabis plants as well as

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,399
i'll give you some ideas for identifying

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,239
it and controlling it

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,839
at the very end i'll show you a plant

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,960
that was right near harvest time

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,199
that sadly was identified to have blood

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,199
rot

12
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,800
[Music]

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,879
all right let's go over how to identify

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
and control bud rot or called grey mold

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,039
or botrytis

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,799
on cannabis plants so first off

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,399
bud rot or botrytis provides two most

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,479
common names

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,799
or also called gray mold develops

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,640
primarily in dense portions of the plant

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,640
sadly such as the flower buds and is

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,719
favored by high humidity

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,320
grain mold growth can be seen as masses

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,039
of mycelium which are basically fungal

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,558
strands

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
and clusters of canadia which are

27
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,519
asexual spores that are produced in

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,759
large numbers

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
if it starts internally to the bud this

30
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,759
could be a very unwelcome surprise at

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,878
the end of the season harvest

32
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,798
when you're going through and kind of

33
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,959
peeling back and trimming it your

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
earbuds you could find that actual

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,879
residual in the center portion there

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
so it's good to do inspections ahead of

37
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,560
time now the life cycle

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,200
of botrytis here just this is shown on

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
strawberry but very similar metrics is a

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
disease

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,040
in strawberries but the sources of of

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
this inoculum include infective leaves

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
or

44
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,679
sclerosia primary infections of flowers

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
and secondary infections of fruit

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,880
are depicted here now keep in mind this

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,079
botrytis

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,199
species looks like this on a close-up so

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,118
think about all these little kind of

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,079
branches that can easily break off

51
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,759
and go and affect other portions this is

52
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,599
also what gives it that very fuzzy like

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
appearance because you literally have

54
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,719
these like tree leaf branch-like things

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
that occur

56
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,078
and here we see the canadian infecting

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
the fruit or infecting the flowers

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,959
causing more infection

59
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,640
causing those to develop into

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,640
candiospores and

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
going through and mycelium going through

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,879
infecting causing repeated infections

63
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
and in areas of high humidity which are

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,239
typically in cannabis late in the season

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,000
this just encourages this perpetuation

66
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,759
of this life cycle

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,840
so how do you go about managing this

68
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,000
well high humidity 90 plus

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,319
for 12 hours or greater is very

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,159
favorable for botrytis development

71
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,079
physical damage can also increase odds

72
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,840
of detritus getting an initial start

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
remove all trimmings and prune plant

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,759
material off-site

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,759
away from the plants as they may contain

76
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,359
potential residual spores

77
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,120
if identified in the area remove the

78
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,239
infected plant material and then apply a

79
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,840
control product

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
since this is commonly seen late in the

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
growing season be aware

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
of potential residuals and current and

83
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,639
local regulations for any product you're

84
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,318
considering applying

85
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,839
also once identified you may want to

86
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,679
harvest sooner rather than later to

87
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,400
ensure you get a good some clean plant

88
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,120
material

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,159
because some harvest is better than none

90
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,719
now let's take a look

91
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,439
at a bud rot that i was able to identify

92
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,840
in a late

93
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,840
in the late season of a cannabis crop

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
now suddenly we're going through

95
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,519
investigating this is something we don't

96
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
want to see

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
so here we see a bud that's getting

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
close to finishing

99
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
but on this side here we see the

100
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,039
evidence of some bud rot

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,158
this is typically caused by a species of

102
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,560
botrytis

103
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,239
and this can spread very easily once you

104
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,719
get in one area to other parts of the

105
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
plant

106
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,719
as well as other plants that you may

107
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,639
have increasing air circulation and

108
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,759
trying to reduce the amount of moisture

109
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,439
that's kept in there

110
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,560
by sometimes just removing some of the

111
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,479
leaves here and trying to increase

112
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
that chance that maybe some natural sun

113
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,840
could get in there um can all help

114
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,199
things as well

115
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,519
but you can see kind of once it gets

116
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,560
into an area it can spread very easily

117
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
so this is something we want to be

118
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,439
scouting for

119
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,158
if we do see it removing it as soon as

120
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,400
possible and in monitoring areas

121
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,798
in and around this one particular bud

122
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
here you can see this plant compared to

123
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,239
some of the others we've seen

124
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,080
a little bit more stress a little bit

125
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
more nutrient deficient we see some more

126
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,599
yelling to the leaves

127
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,878
it could be for a variety of reasons but

128
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,719
a little bit more stressed

129
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,318
and sure enough that's the plant that

130
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,560
has one of the buds at least

131
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:11,598
that is starting to show this bud rot so

132
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,598
worth inspecting the entire plant
