1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:04,859
okay here I'll cut the genetic

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,480
engineering summary and then after the

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,359
summary we'll go through a couple stages

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,000
in experimentation so starting with the

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,949
general summary we're looking at the

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,379
engineered animals can also apply to

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:22,410
plants it's the same basic process of

8
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:25,739
changing or modifying different genes in

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,240
an organism so start off with a gene

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,489
cloning let me go through just the

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,739
highlights here so step one is a small

12
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,058
circular DNA molecule called plasmids me

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,640
remember that from our previous videos

14
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,339
I'll remove from bacterial cells these

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,870
plasma serves serve as vectors which are

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,730
molecules that carry genes of interest

17
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,128
and that unit of interest could be just

18
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:47,788
something we want to multiply something

19
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,710
we're interested in developing let me go

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,850
through a lack C gene would be an

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,460
example antibiotic resistance genes or

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,989
also could be added here we see

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,850
restriction sites if you remember from

24
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:02,280
our restriction enzymes those are areas

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,228
where it might be specific couple sites

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,260
again those plasmids are those small

27
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:09,118
circular regions of DNA found in

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,430
prokaryotic cells in this case bacterial

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,188
DNA containing the gene of interest is

30
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,799
also taken from its original cell so

31
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:17,908
this cell here contains our gene of

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,130
interest whatever didn't want to

33
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,469
multiply we're taking it out of this

34
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:25,228
nucleus so this would be a eukaryotic

35
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:27,658
cell and we are going to put it into our

36
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:30,530
plasmid so step three is restriction

37
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,850
enzyme recognizes is specific

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,310
restriction site and it's a short

39
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,828
sequence about four to eight bases long

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,320
and this is a specific region here

41
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:42,929
restriction site where that DNA is going

42
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,239
to be cut if you remember from our

43
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,399
restriction enzyme video here we're

44
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,379
going to cut the DNA we're going to

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,780
cause these things called sticky ends

46
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,429
these sticky ends our bases that don't

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,618
have pairs and they want to pair up they

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,469
want to join and that's part of the

49
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,989
sticky ends part for it breaks apart the

50
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,000
DNA these restriction enzymes leaving

51
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,459
overhanging regions called sticky ends

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,759
these restrictions enzymes cut open the

53
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,250
circular plasmids and the same enzyme

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,199
cuts our gene of interest so it's

55
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,919
important and the same enzyme is used

56
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,379
because we

57
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,809
these to rejoin to one another so I want

58
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,769
them to cut the very same specific

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,659
sequence moving on from step four

60
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,130
and we left right here in step four we

61
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,780
has that five these sticky ends of the

62
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,568
restriction fragments attached to one

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,860
another via base pairing in a binds with

64
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:33,810
T defines let's see that's the same

65
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,790
thing that happens the gene of interest

66
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,159
gets included into some of the plasmids

67
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,709
forming recombinant plasmids so it's

68
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,389
important here some of the plasmids we

69
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,310
like to think that every single plasmid

70
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,669
takes and that this particular gene of

71
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,650
interest but that's not always the case

72
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:51,929
so they form weak hydrogen bonds the

73
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,909
gene of interest gets included on other

74
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,980
plasmids close right back up remaining

75
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,930
unchanged so we could see an example

76
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,969
here the red indicates the gene of

77
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,530
interest some plasmids basic it's

78
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,289
separated with the restriction enzymes

79
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,280
and get rejoined and they did not take

80
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:09,500
into deed of interest

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,669
DNA ligase links our bonds together

82
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,830
makes bombs permanent by attaching

83
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:15,629
nucleotides to each other with those

84
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,239
phosphodiester bonds you may remember

85
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,370
from methylation these phosphodiester

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,140
bonds are joining that ligation and

87
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,329
they're forming now a larger plasmid but

88
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,099
still at circular form of DNA the

89
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,420
plasmids are mixed with bacterias some

90
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,340
of them take up the plasmids in the

91
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,048
process called transformation that

92
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,849
should also sound familiar can hopefully

93
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,980
see a lot of these terms are coming back

94
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,900
into this one big summary of genetic

95
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,189
engineering

96
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,319
so our unchanged plasmids here don't

97
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,049
have the little red and our recurrent

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,000
plasmids do and some of those both

99
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,519
unchanged any comment are taken up by

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,620
our vector results

101
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,650
moving on from step 7 step 8

102
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,259
the plasmids here with our lack c gene

103
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,090
turn the bacterial blue in the recurrent

104
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,519
plasmids the inserted gene interrupts

105
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,450
the lacks a gene and the bacteria remain

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,719
their original color

107
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:06,328
Macario do not take up any plasmids also

108
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,818
remain uncolored this is used for a way

109
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,280
to identify what bacteria may have taken

110
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,328
up our gene of interest

111
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,639
antibiotics can also be added because

112
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,129
the plasmid contains genes of antibiotic

113
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,930
resistance so other than just inserting

114
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,728
our gene of interest for whatever that

115
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,449
may be it could be produced insulin or

116
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:27,389
something we also introduced antibiotic

117
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,899
resistance genes what these allow us to

118
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,740
do or

119
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:31,289
when would you make engineering

120
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,509
something is to select for those cells

121
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,680
that took up our gene of interest those

122
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,319
cells that took up our gene of interest

123
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,600
also get this antibiotic resistance gene

124
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,978
so that when we add antibiotics you can

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,949
see those that did not take up our

126
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,779
plasmid end up dying only those cells

127
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,419
that have the antibiotic resistance

128
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,219
genes will end up surviving those genes

129
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:52,589
those bacteria that have those genes for

130
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,050
antibiotic resistance also have our gene

131
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,819
of interest and that's an important step

132
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,500
here step 10

133
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,759
the bacteria are then sorted by color

134
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,709
isolating the bacteria took up the

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,288
plasmid cane gene of interest in the

136
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,989
uncolored bacteria are then allowed to

137
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:09,689
be produced so we simply have selected

138
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,699
as we can see here these bacteria these

139
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:14,610
blue bacteria in this case or something

140
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:17,100
against they are not taken up so we

141
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,620
could use antibiotic or we can use

142
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,300
coloration sometimes the key part here

143
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,970
is we want to generate genetic

144
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,490
engineering we want to isolate the

145
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,960
bacteria that have our gene of interest

146
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,840
and this is a process which we go

147
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,918
through and do that there's four stages

148
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,549
to through genetic engineering

149
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,978
experiment this is a large view here if

150
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,710
you see here this is the generally all

151
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:42,750
the steps that I just went through in

152
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:46,109
more detail we all saw these stages

153
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,399
milking an experiment so stage 1 some

154
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,860
terms we might become familiar with

155
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,149
cleaving DNA large number of fragments

156
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,788
are produced is separated by

157
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:56,159
electrophoresis there'll be a separate

158
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:58,019
video on this but in the quick summary

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,780
what we're doing we're taking our long

160
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,668
DNA and we are putting it into wells

161
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,649
we're separating out or chopping that da

162
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:08,129
up into different sections then we're

163
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:10,049
separating it based on size larger

164
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:14,250
fragments stay up closer to where we

165
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,829
originally put the whole slug of DNA and

166
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,870
the smaller fragments are able to travel

167
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:20,699
further more on that we do

168
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,990
electrophoresis it's good it's pulled by

169
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,169
current that's where the terminal

170
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,598
electrode comes in stage 2 producing a

171
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:30,719
become a DNA Ginny's vectors important

172
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:33,300
term here site of cleavage cleavage here

173
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,820
is referring to separating our DNA and

174
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,009
these are done by restriction enzymes

175
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,750
vectors are plasmids or sometimes

176
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:41,339
viruses that carry foreign DNA into the

177
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,290
host cell these

178
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,509
dr. DNA is cut with the same enzyme as

179
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,910
the source DNA thus allowing the two to

180
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,000
join not only do we need to cut the host

181
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,970
plasmid to form the sticky ends we also

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,430
need to cut the DNA to take out the gene

183
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,900
of interest we want to add in we want

184
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,910
them both cut the same restriction

185
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,279
enzyme so that they bind together and

186
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,310
form this nightma this nice need to bond

187
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,500
here cloning host cells are using

188
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,389
bacteria as the bacterial cell

189
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,790
reproduces it forms a clone containing

190
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,710
the fragment bearing vector again all

191
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,879
we're doing is using bacteria cuz they

192
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,739
multiply so rapidly

193
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,659
for example ecole I can multiply every

194
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,519
20 minutes and we're basically

195
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,740
multiplying that gene of interest very

196
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,609
quickly turning a lot of plasmids and

197
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,560
cloning those during a lot of the genes

198
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,000
we have a screening process so the

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,530
primary screen of clone library

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,759
eliminates clones without the vectors

201
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,069
those that don't have the gene of

202
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,399
interest are clones with vectors that

203
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,870
don't contain DNA in certain cases here

204
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,000
we have the example of our DNA fragment

205
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,060
in our vector since to become a vector

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,459
that we want not all cells would take up

207
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,079
this particular plasmid so we'll just

208
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,430
take up the vector without the gene of

209
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,978
interest and that's how we have a

210
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,780
screening process could be antibiotic

211
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,699
resistance it could also be based on

212
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,089
color in that to your talents are going

213
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,469
on agar could see here nice tea streak

214
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:04,199
that screening again as I mentioned the

215
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,000
antibiotic resistance ampicillin czar

216
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,870
very common antibiotic that's used

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,660
we take our cells we put them on those

218
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,538
that have an ozone those that have our

219
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,700
gene of interest also have that

220
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:20,490
antibiotic gene and able to break down

221
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,930
ampicillin be able to survive while type

222
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,509
or general cells are not able to do that

223
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,329
so we ensure the cells that are left are

224
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,949
the ones that have our gene of interest

225
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,699
because they also have antibiotic

226
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,019
resistance

227
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:36,899
it's a selecting agent beta collected

228
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,269
ace is another way this is looking at

229
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,610
color so the white colonies have the

230
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:44,338
plasmids with the foreign insert blue

231
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,500
cows have plasmids without the insert so

232
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,660
we would be selecting for the white

233
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,339
colonies here and basically what's

234
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,699
happening here is we're interrupting the

235
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,350
normal sequence of the genes causing the

236
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,780
cell to lose its color

237
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,330
that white color are the cells that we

238
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,769
want this again shows our sticky ends

239
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,350
forming from our plasma in there just

240
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:07,079
cut with a restriction enzyme ampicillin

241
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,790
resistance gene and then we can see the

242
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,470
genome with the in this case the

243
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:12,599
plasmids with the gene of interest

244
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,480
located here and we need a screening

245
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,240
process because as you can see here not

246
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,990
every bacterial cell took up the vector

247
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,279
with the gene that we don't want it so

248
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,769
just a quick summary from while watch

249
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,419
the this you to other YouTube video this

250
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,860
is just a way we're taking our plasmid

251
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:30,659
we're cutting it open with our

252
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,210
restriction enzymes and we're putting in

253
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,939
our gene of interest but we also need a

254
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,009
way to select for or insure the bacteria

255
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,630
that we have have our gene of interest

256
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:42,539
we can do that through antibiotic

257
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:44,789
resistance or also coloration hopefully

258
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:47,750
this is there just hopefully overview

259
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,750
for genetic engineering
