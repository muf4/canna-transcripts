1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,418
okay so you can't want to go over

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,160
artificial lighting setup basics it's

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,839
really easy for growers to go out and

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,490
buy a bunch of lights and then worry

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,809
about setting them up so what if you

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,809
think about your grow room or your gross

7
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,939
space and look at it realistically and

8
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:17,820
then buy lights that match that

9
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,140
particular setup so first off planning

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,028
your lighting system well all lights

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,560
generate some form of heat so you should

12
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,989
have an idea about how you're going to

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,848
manage this basics should be taking the

14
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,649
consideration our distance your plants

15
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,570
this is you're going to put those lights

16
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,869
from your plants also distance from the

17
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,460
ceiling method of cooling and capacity

18
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,140
of this circuit so you kind of have

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,270
these competing ideas if you want to

20
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,219
light the area but you have this heat to

21
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,660
contend with it kind of becomes this

22
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,700
little chess match of how you're gonna

23
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,929
organize things and you want to make

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,670
sure it's organized ahead of time so

25
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:50,280
you're not fooling around with all these

26
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,129
potentially very expensive lights with a

27
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,198
in a system that will not work so

28
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,878
distance from plants and distance from

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,829
the ceiling so depending on the stage of

30
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,659
growth and type of light well the

31
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,250
recommend distance will change for

32
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,349
example if using fluorescent lights or

33
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,579
looking about three to six inch distance

34
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,919
between the plants and the lights

35
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,840
high-pressure sodium Zoar your other

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,329
high intensity lights looking at two

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,710
feet or greater also want to consider

38
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,179
the distance from the ceiling as this

39
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,640
has to do with the day to cool the

40
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,380
fixture and seeing this grove facility

41
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,359
here there's a good distance to the

42
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,579
ceiling allowing plenty of air

43
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,118
circulation and ability to cool the area

44
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,950
very easily the method of cooling the to

45
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,840
choose lights these lights can generate

46
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,790
heat should also consider a method of

47
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,030
cooling it could be potentially passive

48
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,159
but usually assisted in some way I'll

49
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,500
serve the same purpose but will depend

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,450
on the basics of the growing space so

51
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,989
fan assisted is probably the most common

52
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,390
I can see here's a can filter it's able

53
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:51,509
to really circulate the air well and

54
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,540
also purify and clean the air while it's

55
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,099
also circulating it also one because

56
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,810
think about the system capacity it's

57
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,390
very easy and call it just to add lights

58
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,879
I'll be sure your system can support the

59
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,239
power requirements needed take the total

60
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,949
circuit and support connect up to 80% of

61
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,139
what can be supported by the stated

62
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,550
value of that circuit even if everything

63
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,649
on that circuits not ring at the same

64
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,079
time consider it the worst case

65
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,299
area.also hopefully using a breaker box

66
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:20,370
kind of assisting here and that kind of

67
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:23,280
the old knob-and-tube infusers here

68
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,980
upgrade to kind of a modern day on

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,900
electrical box here help reduce the

70
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:31,169
chance of fire and Ally to spread things

71
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,180
out much more effectively the wire gauge

72
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:36,059
- the higher the number the smaller the

73
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,400
wire diameters we see here 30 gauge 29

74
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,219
gauge 28 gauge as we get to 10 gauge

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,900
much larger 4 gauge 2 gauge 1 gauge this

76
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,840
is little counterintuitive that larger

77
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,430
numbers that smaller wire gauge for

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,500
teens often considered as standard

79
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,739
however if you're doing a long run with

80
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,389
high power consumption 12 gauge or a

81
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,450
lower wire will be recommending to

82
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:59,879
reduce the chance of fire importance of

83
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:03,000
a grounding plug so we're looking at the

84
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,098
example between this plug in this plug

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,590
the entire electrical system should have

86
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,298
a grounding plug if your outlets can

87
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,650
only accept a two prong electrical

88
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,359
device you are highly recommend to

89
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,549
upgrade your system here to include a

90
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,620
grounding plug and these kind of would

91
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,780
be the updated system into the older

92
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,359
system here and both running at the same

93
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,340
voltage but the grounding plug is much

94
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,560
advised because of that ground that is

95
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,709
present to help again make your system

96
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,908
as safe as possible lastly you want to

97
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,469
make sure you're properly seating the

98
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:33,598
bulb so take care to ensure the system

99
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:35,669
is often unplugged and take extra steps

100
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,709
for good electrical connection both with

101
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,810
the ballasts and also at the bulb

102
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,699
connection a lot of times you can see

103
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,620
here that they'll fit in which want to

104
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,940
make sure they're seated properly I also

105
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,500
want to clean the bulb in the reflector

106
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,840
before turning it on make sure

107
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,759
everything checks out before adding

108
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,729
power and turning this on so you have

109
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,870
the safest and most efficient way to

110
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,870
light your plants
