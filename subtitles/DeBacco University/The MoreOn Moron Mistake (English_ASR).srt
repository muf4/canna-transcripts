1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
this can be a problem that a lot of

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,130
growers may not want to admit to it's

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,559
called the or mistake

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,110
here for they approach to gardening and

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,239
growing crops we are simply just over

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,489
adding or adding just more nutrients

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,829
thinking this that's gonna fix your

8
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:21,659
problem so the problem is over

9
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,389
fertilizing is more it's not always

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,399
better it so can be a waste of money you

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,560
can potentially damage your plants and

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,839
can also increase the odds for

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,329
environmental contamination all bad

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,009
things here so the goal is to be in the

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,230
sufficiency range so we kind of see a

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,449
nutrient here increasing concentration

17
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,519
of nutrient increasing plant growth and

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,440
you see here we're getting the maximum

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,719
plant growth this is called the

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,030
sufficiency or optimum range at this

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,800
level the nutrients as the plant has

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,899
enough to function and develop properly

23
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,750
but not at toxic levels

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,198
so this sufficiency range is the should

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,789
be the target of growers now we get into

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,558
something called luxury consumption and

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,989
this is when plants take up more of a

28
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,670
nutrient that is needed so we see we're

29
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,368
within our sufficiency range here

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,840
however at the very top here this is

31
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,030
where the plant is just taking in more

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,618
nutrients than it needs especially if

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,140
you're looking at leafy greens others

34
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,659
can be an issue here with excess

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,909
nitrogen being taken up by the plant

36
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,670
because of the grower over feeding that

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,080
particular nutrient they have something

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,368
called a toxic level and this is when

39
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,019
the nutrients can actually harm the

40
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,969
plants so we're getting on that

41
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,560
sufficiency range and we're getting to

42
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,090
that toxicity range and what happens

43
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,219
here is that plant growth will actually

44
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,109
decrease so over adding certain

45
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,099
nutrients will have to cause a decrease

46
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,469
in plant growth

47
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,509
now that decrease Commedia it's the same

48
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:45,149
as here we're looking at deficiency

49
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,709
symptoms however to correct a deficiency

50
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,379
would simply add nutrients to bring it

51
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,868
up to the sufficiency range when we're

52
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,390
in a toxic situation it can be very hard

53
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,040
to remove one particular nutrient and

54
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,989
adequate amounts to get back to the

55
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,390
sufficiency range a lot of times these

56
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,618
taxes remains this grower induced so you

57
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,689
want to be mindful of what we're adding

58
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,868
so that we don't induce this problem in

59
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,889
our own grow something called a critical

60
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:10,020
level and this is the point which

61
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,939
there's no longer a fertilizer response

62
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,380
what this means is that a very low

63
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,359
levels here or maximum

64
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,740
we're adding fertilizer getting better

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,600
yield getting bigger yield getting

66
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,820
better yield until we reached this

67
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,759
critical level we reach that theoretical

68
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,889
100% yield adding any more fertilizer

69
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,649
you're a lot less likely or in this case

70
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:30,239
not gonna get any increase in yield so

71
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,280
at this point on beyond this critical

72
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,860
level you're increasing your input costs

73
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,909
for no return and this can be a major

74
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,800
issue with wasting money wasting time

75
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,689
wasting resources and potentially

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,910
contaminating the environment so what I

77
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,009
think about sustainability and being as

78
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:50,189
close to that critical level as possible

79
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:53,039
will help ensure not hurting yields with

80
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:55,199
also potentially reducing impacts on the

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,289
environment now what does this look like

82
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,239
in a kind of a corny comparison here so

83
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:02,370
a lot of research done on corn when we

84
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,840
have low levels we see this corn isn't

85
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,870
look as healthy it's more spindly it's

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,729
kind of lighter green in the excess dark

87
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,980
green kind of the whole way down to the

88
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,719
base here the optimum conditions yes a

89
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,429
couple lower leaves are turning brown

90
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,770
and that's fine corn here we're looking

91
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,300
at filling in that ear now last bit of

92
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,430
nutrients they're being pulled out of

93
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,410
the bottom portion of the stock to fill

94
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,510
the ear this would be the optimal amount

95
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:27,180
of nutrients this would be the least

96
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,709
amount of waste and the best yield for

97
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,450
the least amount of input so it's

98
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,219
important to keep this in mind to be

99
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,109
able not to overfill eyes or just add

100
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,240
more and think that's going to solve

101
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,620
your problems because it could just

102
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,620
simply create more
