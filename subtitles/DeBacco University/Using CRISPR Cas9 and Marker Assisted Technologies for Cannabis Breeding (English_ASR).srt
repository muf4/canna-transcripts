1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
all right welcome to this tobacco

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,960
university video you're going to be

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
talking about using crispr

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,240
cas9 and marker assisted technologies

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,080
for cannabis breeding this is kind of a

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
very precise way a

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,240
way a methodology that's being refined

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,359
to specifically target certain sequences

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,198
within a dna

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,760
to splice genes out or add genes that

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,240
growers may be deeming desirable

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,039
so first off what is this crispr cast 9

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,919
well crispr

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,720
crispr is short for clustered regularly

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,120
interspaced short palindromic repeats

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,439
this is a system that evolved as an

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,439
adaptive immune response in bacteria in

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,839
archaea to defend against invading

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,479
viruses this is something that occurs in

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
nature

21
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,159
it allows the bacteria to essentially

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,960
keep a genetic record of invading viral

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,718
dna

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
to allow for a speed up and response

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,600
time to render a virus

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,320
inactive so it's actually an

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,160
evolutionary genetic kind of improvement

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,759
for bacteria to be able to recognize

29
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,078
foreign viral dna

30
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,519
and counteract it at a quicker rate this

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
technology though can be applied to

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
plants breeding

33
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,520
by allowing for a specific gene loci to

34
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,399
be targeted for gene

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
alteration responsible for specifically

36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
turning a sequence and adding in genes

37
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,199
we may again deem desirable

38
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,640
so what's the use for crispr well we're

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,079
looking at crispr breeding processes

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,359
that are assisted with crispr

41
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,959
technologies may benefit from the

42
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,840
reduction the time to develop a new

43
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,158
cultivar

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,000
it's a really great targeted method for

45
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
being able to go through the process

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
of gene editing and as a result this can

47
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,359
allow for

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,680
a quicker development of a cultivar

49
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,319
instead of through traditional breeding

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
so what are marker assisted technologies

51
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,199
well there's a kind of a couple here

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
that i'll be covering

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,560
with isotime variation rflp pcr

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
in microsatellites i'll be at least

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
providing you with a little bit of

56
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,359
background it's a brief overview

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
of each of these within this video

58
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,879
lecture so let's start with

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
kind of where do we get this information

60
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,599
from it's always good to cite your

61
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,359
sources and we see here

62
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,959
a reference article that you're welcome

63
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,560
to go through and provide you with the

64
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,519
reference link to copy the first page in

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
a direct link

66
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,039
welcome to go and take a look at this if

67
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,279
you want to learn even more information

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
than is presented here so starting with

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,800
the first one that i mentioned isozyme

70
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,038
variation so maybe something you're

71
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
probably not familiar with per se maybe

72
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,839
something that's not very common and

73
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,919
understandably so

74
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
but isozymes are basically protein

75
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,919
markers this technique is based on the

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,920
principle that allelic variations exist

77
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,598
for many different types of proteins

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,359
this uses a simple process of making a

79
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,079
crude protein extract from some tissue

80
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
sources

81
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,200
usually leaves that are separated by gel

82
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,039
electrophoresis

83
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,958
the disadvantage though is a number of

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,959
isozyme loci that can be

85
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
scored is limited it's kind of a

86
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
limiting form of technology and

87
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,039
different source tissues will provide

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,719
different results

89
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,079
so it may not necessarily be repeatable

90
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,919
amongst the whole plant

91
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
as a result this is rarely used today in

92
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,919
favor of what i'm going to talk about

93
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
next rflps which you may still see some

94
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,280
instances

95
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
particularly old studies where this was

96
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
utilized

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
so this rflps what does that stand for

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
that's looking at what's called

99
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
restriction

100
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,640
fragment length polymorphism this is a

101
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,919
molecular marker based on differences in

102
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,759
the genomic dna level these rflp markers

103
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,559
are defined by a specific enzyme probe

104
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,479
combination

105
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
that identifies one single locus at a

106
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,878
time and utilizes agarose gel

107
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,158
separation the disadvantages of using

108
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,079
rflps is that

109
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,679
genomic clones that are represented

110
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
sequences at random

111
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,319
are poor choices as hybrisation probes

112
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
because plant genomes consist of a large

113
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,158
percent of repeated sequences

114
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,158
and those repeated sequences can cause

115
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,639
issues in the sense that there's

116
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,158
not necessarily 100 all unique dna

117
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,399
amongst the whole length

118
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,919
this has not been widely used for hemp

119
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,158
compared to other crop species

120
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,000
simply because of this evidence that

121
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,000
there is a lot of repeating units

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,199
so it makes this technique a little less

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,039
effective

124
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,039
then we get to pcr which again stands

125
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,598
for polymix chain reaction

126
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,959
uh something we might hear about uh more

127
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,158
where a common technique been around for

128
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
quite a number of years

129
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,719
and this is the restriction digest of

130
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,759
genomic dnas followed by a pcr

131
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,158
amplification of the fragments obtained

132
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,759
this uses labeled primers that anneal to

133
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,598
the ends of the fragments the needle

134
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,679
something means to attach to

135
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,518
having a variable number of extra

136
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,640
nucleotides randomly chosen so to

137
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,798
amplify

138
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,319
only a subset of the total fragments is

139
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,798
obtained it's really looking at that

140
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,800
targeted kind of genetic sequence

141
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,959
the labeled amplification products are

142
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
run through a polycriminal gel

143
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
and then are separated so you kind of go

144
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
through you have this long piece of dna

145
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,280
you're looking for a certain gene

146
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,279
you have these certain primers that are

147
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,198
targeting a specific sequence of that

148
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,198
whole gene as we can see right here

149
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
we go through this cycle many many times

150
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,879
during many copies if that

151
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,160
targeted sequence is there and we run it

152
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,120
through a gel to separate

153
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
out again visually confirm its presence

154
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
or where it may

155
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
be within that dna sequence meaning if

156
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
there was a lot of products you're going

157
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
to see a very darkened bar there

158
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,759
indicating a lot of

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,160
dna at that particular base pair

160
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
length then lastly here we have

161
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
something called microsatellites so

162
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,359
what's the microsatellites referring to

163
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,879
well these are short sequences of two

164
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
three or more nucleotides that are

165
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,038
represented from a variable number of

166
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,079
times

167
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,319
in a genome in general one single locus

168
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,680
is identified by each pcr reaction

169
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,360
but the number of alleles that can be

170
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
identified is very high

171
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
as the very variability in the repeated

172
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,400
motif

173
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,560
number is high in the plant genomes so

174
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,000
only recently identified and used for

175
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
cannabis is kind of like the new and

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
emerging technology

177
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,120
microcellulic markers were the most

178
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
useful in describing the

179
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,319
hemp germoplasm so as a result from the

180
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
studies showing

181
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,240
or indicating that these micro

182
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,560
satellites show greater promise

183
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,439
this is what's being considered to maybe

184
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,439
be utilized

185
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,279
more going forward at least for cannabis

186
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,759
simply because of the many repeated

187
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,879
units

188
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,199
that tend to exist so pcr is still

189
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,279
involved but not just using pcr

190
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,680
utilizing these kind of short sequences

191
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,079
these micro satellites for example here

192
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,240
to look for these repeats there and

193
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,159
shows a lot of promise looking at hemp

194
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
and can be a great way to potentially

195
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,120
look at breeding cannabis and knowing an

196
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,758
understanding of cannabis with greater

197
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
detail

198
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,720
going forward
