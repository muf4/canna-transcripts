1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,429
here we're going to go over the

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,740
difference between monocots and dicots

3
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:10,678
pictured here I have a represented of

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,199
each of these two categories monocots

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,419
are here they look like grasses or small

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,868
corn plants and dicots here is

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,250
represented by the bean plant

8
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:23,039
specifically what monocot and dicot is

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,969
referring to are short for us and say is

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,510
cotyledons

11
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:29,399
so monocotyledons or dicotyledons and

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,800
cotyledons is translated into meaning

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,629
seed leaves so an interest perm see and

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,030
the sperm is fully used but by the time

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,070
the seeds mature food reserves are

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,780
stored by the embryo and swollen fleshy

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,480
leaves called these cotyledons or see

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,399
leaves dicots have two cotyledons an

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,979
example this would be squash and that's

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,170
just the seedling I have represented

21
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,419
here and over here I have monocots and

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,670
these have one cuddly and these are corn

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,039
plants they look like grasses they come

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,280
up with that one single blade where

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,620
dicots have basically two seed leaves

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,179
when they emerge now there's many

27
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,338
differences between the models and

28
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,159
dicots more than just their seed leaves

29
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,989
there's differences in the number of

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,880
seed leaves as I mentioned but there's

31
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:15,569
also differences within those leaves of

32
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,179
the way that the veins are organized for

33
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,739
monocots are looking at parallel veins

34
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,189
dicots looking at broad leaf network of

35
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:25,169
veins the vascular bundles are more

36
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:27,989
scattered in monocots and there's more

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,000
of a distinctive ring in dicots and the

38
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,719
flower parts are in multiples of 3 for

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,780
monocots and multiples of 5 or sometimes

40
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,578
4 in monocots also the root system is

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,280
very different in monocots it's more

42
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,228
fibrous and in dicots it's more of a tap

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,210
root system now I'll have some of these

44
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,978
same comparisons throughout this

45
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,688
presentation good to try to learn the

46
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,840
differences or distinguishing factors

47
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,250
between these two and here's another

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
representative image you see the

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,478
monocots here the die-cuts here showing

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,840
the leaf venation

51
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,759
the number of multiples in their flower

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,310
the root type when we look at the

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,769
microscope it microscopic images we're

54
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,390
looking at the scattered that's their

55
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,159
bundles and monocots a little more

56
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,389
organized in a ring structure for dicots

57
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,680
and of course once you leave verses 2

58
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,449
bringing some of the real world images

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,000
could see again how those leaves may

60
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,009
look dicots can be much more varied

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,050
shows in the microscopic image of the

62
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,629
scattered vascular bundles indicative of

63
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,150
monocots in the distinctive rings that

64
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,799
are evident for dicots and the floral

65
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,409
parts that might be four or five

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,130
multiples for dicots or typically three

67
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:40,740
cuts that stem that I was talking about

68
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,419
the kind of organized in the ring here

69
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,640
is the dicot this is what I mean by

70
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,019
scattered see the other it might be a

71
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,269
little bit more concentration to the

72
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,780
perimeter here but overall relatively

73
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,240
scattered throughout this tab bringing

74
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,000
that to a real-world root comparison now

75
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,430
the dicots here of this kind of central

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,669
key portion kind of almost looks like a

77
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,310
tee or an X and monocots have this kind

78
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:07,889
of internal ring structure to their root

79
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,530
system remember the monocots can be more

80
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,829
fibrous and the dicots can be more of a

81
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,840
central tap root system bring that to

82
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,269
the larger scale which I might be more

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,030
familiar with here's a dicot stem I

84
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,030
should say root system here and it's

85
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,489
kind of that one central tap root the in

86
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,860
lines are a prime example of this you

87
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,050
ever tried to pull roots up from a grass

88
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,500
species or pull it up the grass in the

89
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,239
lawn

90
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,060
then those it's much more fibrous root

91
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,469
system a lot more intertwined here

92
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,689
above-ground the monocots will click

93
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,639
those single blades and those dicots

94
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:43,409
have that kind of broad leaf appearance

95
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,208
here and the different de nations in the

96
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:48,030
game then in alliance and example the

97
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,849
daikon and grass species are examples of

98
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,769
monocots zooming in a little bit more

99
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,209
comparing the leaves and it'll be other

100
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,269
videos to help explain a little bit more

101
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,840
about the leaves monocots that parallel

102
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,670
venation

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,489
you could see dicots a little bit more

104
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:07,169
complex network of veins and blue the

105
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,569
same image here but bringing in now the

106
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,879
seedlings as we can see the monocots are

107
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,439
that single kind of blade that comes up

108
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,569
and dicots

109
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,180
are those two seed leaves that emerge

110
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,349
and this could be a pea plant this could

111
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,358
be I could say the squash plant

112
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,960
watermelon many many different things

113
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,269
fall into these categories this is an

114
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,698
engine concept if you've ever seen this

115
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:31,709
roundup for lawns kills weeds would not

116
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,840
belong so just what we learned about

117
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,370
here with monocots and dicots without

118
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,318
getting into the specifics of the

119
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,860
chemistry that works in this particular

120
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:44,189
brand of herbicide this is targeting the

121
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,740
dicots so it says kill the weeds most of

122
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:49,800
the weed species such as dandelions in

123
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,129
this case clovers viewed as a weed as an

124
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,340
example of dicots so this chemistry is

125
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:58,860
working on something specific to dicots

126
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:02,538
where it says not my lawn the lawn is a

127
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,158
monocot certain chemistry's certain

128
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:07,560
plant behaviors are not going to be

129
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:09,810
evident in monocots and this particular

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,310
chemical will only attack dicots

131
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,348
so that's how you can apply this to the

132
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,530
lawn and will kill the weeds but not the

133
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:15,529
lawn
