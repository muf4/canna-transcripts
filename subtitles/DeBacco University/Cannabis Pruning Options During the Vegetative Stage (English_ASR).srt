00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
on this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,199
going over canvas pruning options

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,039
things you might want to consider as

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,199
well as some of the advantages and

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,000
disadvantages so you can select the best

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
pruning method

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
that fits your growing situation

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,240
[Music]

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,760
all right let's get into cannabis

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,079
pruning options during the vegetative

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,920
stage of cannabis production

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,439
so first off the general concept of

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,559
pruning is that it directs the plant to

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,799
be efficient with

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,558
its production different methods can

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,679
direct the plant to best match the given

17
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,280
growing conditions

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,039
what you're trying to do is eliminate

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,760
any unwanted parts so

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,359
by removing these unneeded plant areas

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,000
this can help reduce the chance for

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,079
disease by simply increasing air flow

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,759
and it can also increase the yield of

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,000
wanted plant components

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,359
so for example these lower leaves here

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,359
could breed disease could help

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,280
reduce air circulation by removing those

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,399
we can get a plant that can maximize the

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
light exposure

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,879
reduce the chance of disease and

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,280
hopefully also maximize our yields

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,478
so the pruning techniques covered now in

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,320
this video i'm just going to give the

34
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,118
simple advantages and disadvantages of

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,199
each

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,319
however if you search this channel you

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,400
should be able to find

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,679
more detailed videos on each of these

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,759
pruning methods here

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
such as topping sea of green screen of

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,000
green the fin technique super cropping

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,600
lollipop and not pruning canvas plants

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,680
what will happen with that

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,519
so first off if you're looking or

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,360
considering plant topping

46
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,200
also called tipping or pinching the

47
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,799
plant the advantage is it's really easy

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
to do as we can see here you take the

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
find that main stalk and you just

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,000
basically

51
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,319
top it or pinch it off the is that

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,359
it limits the number of branch points

53
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,679
that you can have there

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,040
so here we're getting basically from one

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,159
we're going to two we're essentially

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
doubling that

57
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
but really we can see that once this is

58
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
pinched we'll determine

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,000
how we grow those out this could be part

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,000
or integrated as part of other

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,759
techniques but true topping or pinching

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
is really just removing that top apical

63
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,079
meristem

64
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,719
now the sea of green this helps improve

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,039
yields

66
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,878
and allows for a quicker harvest time

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,719
you can see here basically it creates a

68
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:15,039
sea or a kind of a good solid canopy

69
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,479
of all the plant tops the disadvantage

70
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,719
though it's not a good option

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,919
for limited plant grows meaning if you

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,800
can only grow

73
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,679
a couple plants not really kind of the

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
option

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,159
there it's also reduced effectiveness is

76
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,000
the plant can grow unevenly

77
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,759
so basically what we're trying to create

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,039
here it's kind of that kind of solid

79
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,919
canopy

80
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,479
of buds here with kind of really quickly

81
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,799
turn around

82
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,959
quick turnaround times for the plants

83
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,120
comparing that to the screen of green

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,878
technique well this can be applied to

85
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
many different strains but tends to work

86
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,280
best for those that have long

87
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,159
tall and a leggy habit such as sativa

88
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,439
morphology

89
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,359
the advantage is it really doesn't

90
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,239
maximize the space that each plant can

91
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
take up

92
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
often also also offers even light

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
exposure for all buds

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,158
so if we're looking here we have one

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
plant we're basically pruning it out so

96
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,840
that it spreads out this way

97
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,200
this is called the screen of green

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
reason being it typically involves some

99
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,560
sort of mesh

100
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,079
screen that mesh screen does require to

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
be set up ahead of time

102
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,680
and needs to be timed well with the

103
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,679
plant growth rate

104
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
greater space is needed per plant so

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
that's a disadvantage of this method

106
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,000
however unlike the sea of green where

107
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,518
you're kind of printing all your plants

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,158
to be smaller and quicker turnaround

109
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
times

110
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,199
this can be more advantageous also if

111
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
you're looking at limited number of

112
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,280
plants

113
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,958
you can take one plant you can really

114
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
spread it out over a large

115
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,598
area but it does take a little bit

116
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
longer then we have the thin technique

117
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,959
this technique is typically used along

118
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,000
with other pruning techniques to

119
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
maximize both

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,439
methods typically the screen of green

121
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,159
and sea of green pruning methods will be

122
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,079
incorporated

123
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,759
with this potentially the advantage is

124
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
it's very similar to topping

125
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,039
in the sense that you are pinching a

126
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,199
portion of the plant here but

127
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,560
instead it promotes a bushier growth

128
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,158
this can maximize

129
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
those looking to clone a plant because

130
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:58,079
instead of just pinching the plant

131
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
getting two

132
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,519
you're pinching it in a way that

133
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
basically allows multiple

134
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,120
branch points to come out this

135
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,039
encourages lateral side branching which

136
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,719
can make for a denser plant

137
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,318
and these plants will often require

138
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,239
staking so be mindful of that if you're

139
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,000
looking at adopting this pruning method

140
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,280
it's not advised for autoflowers because

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,798
this delay of this

142
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
time it takes to produce these other

143
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,198
branches this delay in pla

144
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,720
in plant growth is best to kind of hold

145
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
plants in the vegetative state for four

146
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
to six weeks

147
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,000
and with autoflowers when you have that

148
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,800
dedicated number of days until harvest

149
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,918
that delay can offset the plant timing

150
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,918
and reduce your overall yields per plant

151
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,000
then we also have super cropping and

152
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,680
here we see kind of it's like we're not

153
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,279
breaking the plant here we're bending it

154
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
pretty aggressively here

155
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,559
and this can produce high yields it

156
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
allows more light penetration down here

157
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
deeper in the canopy

158
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,799
it also helps reduce plant height

159
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,918
without removing plant material so if

160
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
you've got a plant that's getting really

161
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,240
close to a light

162
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,478
you can super crop it we're basically

163
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,079
bending it right over the disadvantages

164
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,839
it does require a bit of technique

165
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,959
because if done wrong the plant yields

166
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,478
will suffer in the sense if you're

167
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,359
breaking the plants off

168
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,478
that can be at a disadvantage the

169
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
advantageous point where you're kind of

170
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,000
pinching it getting it to here

171
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
looks pretty severe and it kind of is

172
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,120
but this plant will continue to grow

173
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,759
here you're not breaking it at this

174
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,439
point

175
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
it's also a stressful to the plant so

176
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,560
timing and care should correlate with

177
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
this pruning method

178
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
you don't always want to go through into

179
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,399
super crop you want to make sure you're

180
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
timing things

181
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,079
in reducing plant stresses as well

182
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,478
we also have the lollipop method and the

183
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,159
goal here is to maximize the buds

184
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,758
uh it's often used with this screen of

185
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
green technique it gets the

186
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,038
name lollipopping because you're

187
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,239
basically taking all the lower leaves

188
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,879
off you can see it looks like a bunch of

189
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
sticks

190
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,079
you kind of get that big bulge at the

191
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,038
top there so it sort of looks like a

192
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,120
lollipop

193
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,879
the disadvantage is it requires repeated

194
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,439
rounds of pruning and leaf removal

195
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,199
so this is relatively labor-intensive

196
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,680
you can see it here as well but the goal

197
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
here

198
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,038
is that the leaves will be the amount of

199
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,000
sun

200
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,439
or light exposure and then lastly

201
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,879
mentioned here just what if you choose

202
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,519
not to print your canvas plants well

203
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,199
it's an easy

204
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,198
method because there's basically no work

205
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,079
involved i think that's why some growers

206
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,600
do choose it

207
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,758
but the disadvantages is it reduced

208
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
plant efficiency and it can also

209
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
increase plant diseases because it's so

210
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,120
dense there's leaves on top of leaves

211
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,799
so keep that in mind that if you are not

212
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,439
going to prune your cannabis plant

213
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,639
you could be getting more diseases more

214
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,319
insect pressure

215
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,240
and basically not making the plant as

216
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,520
efficient as it could be

217
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,199
so with this brief exclamation

218
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,758
advantages and disadvantages of each was

219
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,439
helpful

220
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,439
there's one you want to learn more about

221
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,719
search this channel and hopefully you'll

222
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,719
have some more

223
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
detail provided for each
