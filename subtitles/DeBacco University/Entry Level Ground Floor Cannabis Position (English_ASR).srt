1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,160
so in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,199
going to explore entry-level ground

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,720
floor cannabis

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,080
positions so if you're interested in

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,359
kind of just getting started in the

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,879
cannabis industry

7
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,558
a lot of times you're kind of working at

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
the ground floor if you want to know

9
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,759
more what

10
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,480
that might involve continue watching

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,480
this video

12
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,720
[Music]

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,720
all right let's get into entry level

14
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,479
ground floor cannabis position

15
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,759
seeing here in the image we've got some

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,558
uh plants getting hung

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,239
ready to go through the drying process

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,599
all right so the job description

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,799
is involving uh we typically that entry

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
level grower position

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,159
you're gonna be looking at responsible

22
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,000
that growing that cultivation of

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,759
operations you want to ensure that all

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,159
plants are properly maintained and ready

25
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,479
for

26
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,238
processing want to follow current good

27
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,279
manufacturing practices

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,759
and you're going to report to the

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,439
manager of the growing department

30
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,640
now depending on the size of facility

31
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,878
you're looking at you could be

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,960
specializing in just the propagation

33
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,959
the veg the flowering maybe the drying

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
stage or if it's a smaller operation

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,559
you might be going through and

36
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,919
responsible for all portions of the

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
growing cycle of the plant

38
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,719
so important to check that out their

39
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,079
day-to-day activities just in general

40
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,239
always ensure the equipment is working

41
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,920
properly and maintain

42
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,679
a safe and clean working environment

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,478
that can conclude cleaning up the plants

44
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
pruning out

45
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,478
dead leaves and removing them from the

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
growing area

47
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,319
for harvesting you could be planting

48
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
transplanting water and feeding

49
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,839
defoliating staking

50
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,359
disposal of plant materials supposing of

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,960
substrates all those

52
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,478
are involved day to day depending on

53
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,919
what day it is during the year

54
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,478
for crop inspections you're looking at

55
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
pest identification record keeping

56
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,599
and track and record data on

57
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,600
environmental factors

58
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,798
temperatures min max minimum

59
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,679
temperatures maximum temperatures

60
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,759
humidity levels

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
things like that and the all-important

62
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,200
documentation

63
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
so qualities that a person must have if

64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
you're thinking about kind of pursuing

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,439
this kind of

66
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,118
uh position ability to read and

67
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,398
comprehend documents such as standard

68
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,078
operating instructions

69
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
properly filing and executing

70
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,798
assignments capable of working well with

71
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,478
others

72
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
willingness to learn because hopefully

73
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
you could progress up

74
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,560
the growing facility there over time

75
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,479
ability to perform math calculations and

76
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
measurements important for fertilizers

77
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,359
ability to focus and pay attention to

78
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,318
detail because every grower is going to

79
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
have their own

80
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,238
suggestions or ways to do things they

81
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,479
communicate effectively

82
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
it must be a reliable and honest key

83
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,519
part area is showing up

84
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,000
you have to be there to again take care

85
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,840
of the plants be able to carry and lift

86
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,959
50 pounds must be able to spend long

87
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,800
hours on their feet

88
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
to go through in pruning removing

89
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
harvesting all that can be

90
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,079
very labor intensive and lastly just a

91
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
general connection here to the cannabis

92
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
industry

93
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,159
often you work closely with managers as

94
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,519
well as other employees

95
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,959
growers are the first step in the

96
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
manufacturing process and their

97
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,680
attention to detail and quality checks

98
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,400
allow for clean medical grade canvas

99
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
that we have in the industry today

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
anyone can become a grower it just takes

101
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,239
time and practice many companies will

102
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,759
hire

103
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,519
a wide variety of employees for the

104
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,318
entry level position it's an

105
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,319
easy way to work yourself up and into

106
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,759
the industry there so again

107
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,079
don't be afraid if you're taking that

108
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,000
entry level position you can learn a lot

109
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
and get exposed to a lot and then maybe

110
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
determine a subset within the cannabis

111
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
industry that is of greatest interest to

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
you
