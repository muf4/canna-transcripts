1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,299
so here we're going to be looking at

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,580
protein structure we've seen this

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,528
initial image different ways of

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,929
representing structure to try to show

5
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:11,699
the three-dimensional shape because for

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,769
proteins is we're going to see here

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,138
shape is very important to their proper

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,969
function so just give you a basic idea

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,129
is there's four main stages of

10
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,778
organization this is just the amino acid

11
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,210
sequence and this is going to take on an

12
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:27,480
initial shape is going to start to form

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,278
and ultimately here the fourth stage of

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,668
protein structures ultimately make a

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,289
functional protein so the general

16
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,479
overview of protein structure levels are

17
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,450
the Assembly of the amino acid sequence

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,609
the initial folding or forming alpha and

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,840
beta sheets we have the packaging here

20
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,850
or starting at a three-dimensional

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,600
structure in an interaction where we

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,789
have a complex of a protein molecule

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,250
making this functional protein in the

24
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,260
end so starting with the basics protein

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,808
assembly the primary structure the

26
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,968
specific sequence of amino acids is

27
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,589
what's going to form a protein so we're

28
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,129
looking here at a ribosome this occurs

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,200
in the cell in the cytosol and this

30
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,390
involves polymerization of amino acids

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,180
attached to the tRNA so here's our

32
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,960
messenger RNA here encoding for the

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,750
sequence we have our ribosome and we are

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,609
building our primary structure which is

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,519
our T RNAs bringing in the amino acid

36
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:26,579
sequence binding here allowing us to

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,828
follow the messenger RNA sequence for

38
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,780
amino acids this is using the primary

39
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,209
structure this is just the amino acids

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,739
being linked together

41
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:37,259
now those amino acids it from a linear

42
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,839
kind of chain here this is only one

43
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,030
dimensional a perfect linear amino acid

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,090
polymer is neither functional nor

45
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,189
energetically favorable folding needs to

46
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,829
occur so this is just a link of amino

47
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,669
acids but now we need folding to take on

48
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:55,379
the proper shape and what we see here is

49
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,320
that initial folding is creating now our

50
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:00,030
secondary structure this is folding then

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,699
this shape is taken down because of

52
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,430
hydrogen bonds again this occurs in the

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,350
cytosol of the cell involves localized

54
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,270
interactions which is the primary

55
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,669
structure here developing an alpha helix

56
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,830
this would be a beta sheet these are

57
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:16,530
both part of the secondary structure

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,300
occurring so that secondary structure is

59
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,090
the chemical nature of the carboxyl and

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,650
amino groups all the amino acids this

61
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,509
permits the hydrogen binding to form

62
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,710
this is causing these molecules to

63
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:27,449
become more stable

64
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,189
hence this defines the secretary

65
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,649
structure within a protein and as we see

66
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,180
here alpha helix and beta sheets the R

67
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,920
groups of the variant group is what

68
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,439
impacts the likelihood of secondary

69
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,629
structure formation so primary structure

70
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,629
was your amino acids listed here now

71
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,729
let's take the secondary structure the

72
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,379
secondary structure is nonlinear

73
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:49,199
starting at that three-dimensional shape

74
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:52,019
is because of those variant groups that

75
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,329
are now able to interact the interaction

76
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,650
as we see here here's a hydrogen bonding

77
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,900
and there's also Vander Waals

78
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,740
interactions causing this structure to

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,300
take on this specific shape is it as I

80
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,650
said there's alpha helix and beta sheets

81
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,420
and they have regular hydrogen bonding

82
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,300
patterns and we can classify them as

83
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,549
that the beta sheets you may assume here

84
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,320
forms a very flat structure the Alpha

85
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,760
helix kind of looks like that DNA we're

86
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,159
kind of getting that wrapping that does

87
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:22,469
occur this cytosol wasn't it now our

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,239
tertiary structure involves interactions

89
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,219
between secondary structure elements

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,110
yielding the next level or tertiary

91
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,879
structure so you could see right here we

92
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,290
have an alpha helix here with a beta

93
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,709
sheet now we're getting further

94
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:36,359
interaction that's occurring these

95
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,650
tertiary structures is final

96
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,750
three-dimensional shape of the protein

97
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,150
and see that image here they're

98
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,169
nonlinear and there's three-dimensional

99
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,330
so that's why it's important to show

100
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,738
this rotating so you get appreciation

101
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,780
for the unique three-dimensional

102
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,099
structure that it does have now protein

103
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,199
interactions so we see here tertiary or

104
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,780
quaternary structure so now are getting

105
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,189
different interactions that occur with

106
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,890
these polypeptides

107
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,319
there's multi components now interacting

108
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:06,449
this does still occur in the cytosol and

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,879
its proximity to other folded and

110
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,500
packaged proteins this involves an

111
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,489
interaction among tertiary structure

112
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,019
elements separate into calm energy these

113
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,500
are nonlinear three-dimensional

114
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,870
structures it's an example here kind of

115
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,600
a cartoon image this is hemoglobin you'd

116
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,899
see a distinctive one two three four

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,180
different structures here all coming in

118
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:33,939
interacting with one another to form a

119
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,439
functional final protein structure here

120
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,990
so that three-dimensional shape as we

121
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,139
see here very important so I show it in

122
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,478
a rotating basis you get an idea of the

123
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:48,650
uniqueness from all different angles

124
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,060
here each protein has a unique structure

125
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:52,728
and that's important to remember

126
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,530
now that amino acid sequence that free

127
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:56,478
energy memorization leads to that

128
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:59,299
structure and the dynamics will then

129
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,279
lead to the proper function so this

130
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,740
amino acid sequence looks like kind of a

131
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,329
garbled kind of a misprint here each one

132
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,879
of these letters represents an amino

133
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:10,339
acid those amino acids from a chain and

134
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,199
through the structure and ultimately the

135
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,448
dynamics to form the proper function

136
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,160
that folding process will make this

137
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:20,379
amino acid sequence a functional protein

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,180
now folds can be used for classification

139
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:25,219
there's a simple fold architecture which

140
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,840
is the overall shape and orientation of

141
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,180
the secondary structure as I mentioned

142
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,519
here as alpha and beta barrels for

143
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,379
example we can classify these at what we

144
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,000
call fold families this is a

145
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,978
characterization that takes into account

146
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,199
the empirical or biological properties

147
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,120
this is important because shape

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,060
determines function here we're Clannad

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,860
classifying in different shapes we could

150
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,780
also classify them as super families

151
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,819
which in addition to the fold tailings

152
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,888
includes evolutionary or ancestral

153
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:54,408
properties this gets into trying to

154
00:05:51,889 --> 00:06:00,199
track different proteins or shapes over

155
00:05:54,408 --> 00:06:02,598
the course of evolutionary time so this

156
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,949
is an interesting video here it tells

157
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:06,469
the helps you to understand the

158
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,538
importance of protein folding now

159
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,360
because protein folding does occur we

160
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:13,279
need to have a way to allow proteins or

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,080
amino acids to fold properly

162
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,638
so to help newly produced proteins fold

163
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,680
properly or something called chaperone

164
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,538
proteins and this is what they look like

165
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,769
there's little it's good doughnut here

166
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:24,110
there's literally this kind of

167
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:26,810
protective interior structure these

168
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,658
chaperone proteins allow a protective

169
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,348
area to allow these amino acid sequence

170
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:34,788
to fold into proper functional proteins

171
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:37,009
if these protein if these chaperone

172
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:39,139
proteins have deficiencies it played a

173
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,430
role in certain diseases cystic fibrosis

174
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,110
in all centers disease

175
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,980
is an example of two of them where

176
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,480
proteins don't fold properly so can I go

177
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,770
over that same thing we have a primary

178
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,569
structure which is just even the last

179
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:52,069
sequence that then will lead to

180
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,409
secondary structures which are alpha

181
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:56,389
helixes and beta sheets tertiary

182
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,980
structures the initial three-dimensional

183
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,789
structure formed by the assembly of of

184
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,009
those structures

185
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,110
lastly the quaternary structure this is

186
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:07,550
where their interaction forming with

187
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,199
multiple peptide chains it's just

188
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,550
another way to kind of look at it with

189
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,709
the amino acid sequence we're getting

190
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,230
into initial structures they're kind of

191
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,789
forming a three-dimensional shape and

192
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,170
there's interaction that's occurring

193
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,170
here at the final stage
