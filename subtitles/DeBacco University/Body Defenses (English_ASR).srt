1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,338
looking specifically at the immune

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,280
system our body needs many defenses

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,690
because it's under continual attack

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,359
bindings to build like a fortress to

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,129
help protect itself but this isn't good

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,160
enough now it doesn't need to have a

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,730
fortress it also needs ways to mobilize

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,140
quickly to be able to defend itself also

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,390
if something is able to breach the

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,849
borders and get by the initial first

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,550
response needs a way to be able to hunt

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,549
down and destroy those invaders within

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,230
our body so looking specifically at a

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,468
wonderful video that I can have a

15
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:39,328
love/hate relationship with personally

16
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,859
it's a great video and has greatly

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,259
animation you're welcome to check this

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,229
link out however some of the terms they

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,359
used to describe that I feel don't go

20
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:51,209
into as much science as I would like as

21
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,399
a result I provide some key translations

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,980
here for example when they use purple

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,739
things that stands for virus and if

24
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,689
you're able to watch the video and be

25
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,919
able to at least immensely translate

26
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:06,688
their terms into what those actual

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,460
correspond with regarding the cell then

28
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,709
you probably have developed a good

29
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,379
understanding of what's going on in a

30
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,179
particular video their key part is our

31
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,359
bodies under constant attacks so we need

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,460
a way to help protect and maintain

33
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:24,989
borders and also address invaders that

34
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:27,899
occur to avoid the body having its

35
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:30,780
machinery being used for purposes that

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,859
do not benefit it so how would you

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,450
approach this problem is kind of a

38
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,640
general kind of idea of the immune

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,070
system well step one is to secure the

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,650
borders kind of have a good strong and

41
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:43,859
well maintained skin in our case that

42
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,149
physical barrier in addition to that we

43
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,890
want to mobilize quickly to block a

44
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,868
breach this is an example if you get a

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,590
cut in your skin you want to be able to

46
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:54,750
rush some help out to that area to

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,728
prevent infection from spreading to the

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,500
body

49
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:00,629
lastly third line of defense is to hunt

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,310
down successful invaders for those

51
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,500
microorganisms that are able to

52
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,329
penetrate and get into our body we need

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,989
to have a system in place that's able to

54
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:12,879
seek them out and destroy them this

55
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,200
general summary a little bit more detail

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,060
would be the first sign to secure the

57
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,379
borders to is basically to prevent the

58
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,750
problem from occurring in the first

59
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,969
place sometimes an ounce of prevention

60
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,710
prevention is better than a pound of

61
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:26,740
correction and that's kind of the point

62
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:29,320
here skin mucous membranes I'll try to

63
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,900
prevent or at least limit the entry of

64
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,759
microorganisms now keep in mind not

65
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,430
every microorganism is completely

66
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,859
harmful we have many that we depend on

67
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,480
but we're looking here at the specific

68
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,180
ones that want to do the body harm

69
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,919
certain pathogens in addition to

70
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,650
securing the borders we need a way to

71
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,509
mobilize quickly to block a breach

72
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,219
painting microbial proteins phagocytic

73
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:55,479
cells to localize in an invasion and

74
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,789
potentially control it right then and

75
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,289
there we want to repair the border is

76
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:01,569
the ultimate solution and this is why

77
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,759
our skin will scab over to kind of help

78
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,349
maintain that physical barrier in

79
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,090
addition inflammations the hallmark and

80
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,250
most important mechanism to help lock

81
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,189
and limit the potential spread of

82
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,800
organisms lastly our third line of

83
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,840
defense to hunt down successful invaders

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,710
we want to profile the enemy indiana's

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,930
takes a little time

86
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,810
catch immobilize and destroy invaders

87
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,000
within the body fluids this identifying

88
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,890
destroying and removing my cells that

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,280
are already infected is a time-consuming

90
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:33,039
process and is where the immune system

91
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,349
needs to take some time and to be able

92
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,729
to clear out those invaders that have

93
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,229
been able to get into our body and

94
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:40,299
sometimes that's why we're sick for a

95
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:43,949
couple days and then ideally get better

96
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,950
while this process is occurring
