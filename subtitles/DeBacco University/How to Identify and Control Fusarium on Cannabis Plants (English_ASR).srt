1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,080
in this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,599
going to go over how to identify and

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,719
control fusarium

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,719
in cannabis plants

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,440
[Music]

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,600
while few serum is considered to be a

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,840
soil-borne disease we can see it in fact

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
the stems as well as upper portions of

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,278
the plant as well so don't think it's

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,559
only isolated to the roots

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,839
we're going to go over how to identify

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,000
and control fusion in cannabis plants

13
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,119
here so first off the identification of

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,439
fusarium

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,599
well for serum will and crown wire which

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,359
are caused by the fusarium species

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,800
canvas plants will have a wilted

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,159
appearance and discoloration in the

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,919
vascular tissue

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,359
here we see the wilted appearance here

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
we see that kind of right at the soil

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,920
line

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
that discoloration if we cut into the

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
stem we're going to see kind of this

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,878
kind of

26
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,519
brownish coloration as the plant gets

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,119
into

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,440
the internal components of the plant

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,358
physical damage by a mechanical insect

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,878
or nematodes to the roots can also

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,599
increase the severity

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,920
and rate of spread of fusarium as well

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,079
as

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
if a grower over waters plants or plants

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,920
receive excess

36
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,959
nitrogen this can also cause them to be

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
more prone to

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,319
serum infections note this is a common

39
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,919
occurrence

40
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,000
when high amounts of compost have been

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,600
added to a plant as this does increase

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,879
the water holding capacity as well as

43
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,879
typically the nitrogen

44
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,920
and that will encourage fusarium to

45
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,359
proliferate

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,478
in that substrate of that plant

47
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,840
now word of caution with fusarium is

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,560
that the infection

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
of female buds and grains is a serious

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
and underestimated disease

51
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,158
that may result in contamination by

52
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,759
fusion mycotoxins

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
cornell has found contamination of hemp

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,159
grain to exceed seven parts per million

55
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,759
of this ideal then all so keep in mind

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,359
that while it's a root disease

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439
can affect upper portions of the plant

58
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,000
can cause mycotoxins to develop

59
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,359
can cause some severe issues so don't

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,239
think it's only limited

61
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,920
just to the root section of a plant now

62
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,118
the general life cycle of fusion it's

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
important to understand a life cycle

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,118
because where you can break that life

65
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,719
cycle

66
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,639
interrupt it in some way might be a way

67
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,318
you could reduce severity

68
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,000
now when we're looking at our life cycle

69
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,679
those kind of small little portions

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,800
those germinating spores

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,480
penetrating the lateral roots causing it

72
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
to kind of proliferate causing it to get

73
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,039
into the internal structure

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
of the plant here we see that occurring

75
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,840
while those wound areas are just

76
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,439
encouraging that now we're getting into

77
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,878
the vesicles of the plant

78
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,039
particularly the xylem which is the

79
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,239
water transporting vesicles of the plant

80
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,919
and then it goes through and really

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,800
clogs the why we saw that kind of a

82
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,159
brown image

83
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
brown image is because all those little

84
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,878
fusarium spores are in there clogging up

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,719
the xylem

86
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,239
eliminating the water transport causing

87
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,759
the plant to wilt

88
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,360
then it proliferates from there it

89
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,199
breaks out and get on the leaves can

90
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
then spread and break off get back into

91
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,598
the soil

92
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
proliferate there and then kind of

93
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,039
repeat the cycle again

94
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
so keep in mind if you cerium think

95
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,560
about it's initially affecting the roots

96
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
but really affects a lot of portions of

97
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,759
the plant

98
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,318
so how do you go about controlling it

99
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,519
well indoor and outdoor applications

100
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,560
both of these we could look at on other

101
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,719
plant species

102
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
pseudomonas strains have several

103
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,359
endophytes such as trichoderma strains

104
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,598
have offered

105
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
better control than mycorrhizae fungi

106
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,000
bacillus and nonpathogenic

107
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,039
cerium strains so the pseudomonas or

108
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,479
trichodermas

109
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,318
might be worth investigating its

110
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,759
biological controls

111
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,119
this is one product this is another

112
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,158
product that's contained trichoderma

113
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,439
species

114
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,239
if you're growing chemists in an outdoor

115
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,158
location on a large scale may not be as

116
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,439
advantageous to apply these products so

117
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,479
crop rotations that have some

118
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,400
effectiveness

119
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,679
if levels are initially low when they're

120
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
first identified

121
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
incorporating mustard cover crop can

122
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,639
help but really if you identify it

123
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,158
specifically as fusarium

124
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,158
you might want to look at the cover crop

125
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,840
called hairy vetch this has shown

126
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,120
suppression of fusarium

127
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,519
in fields planted with watermelon

128
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
to eliminate field to field transfer via

129
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,200
tools and equipment

130
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,759
you want to make sure you're not

131
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,119
transferring soil either so eliminate

132
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,639
soil transfers you're not infecting

133
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
multiple fields if you have them

134
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,759
plant maybe some hairy vetch to get some

135
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,799
nitrogen benefit

136
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,239
as well as suppress fusion in the soil

137
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
and there's also some biological

138
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,039
controls that exist we also identify

139
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
early to

140
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,959
try to suppress it key part being if

141
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,238
possible if you identify an area that

142
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
does have to serum

143
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,239
rotate out give that soil a rest plant

144
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,040
some cover crops and then come back

145
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,040
later with your crop of choice
