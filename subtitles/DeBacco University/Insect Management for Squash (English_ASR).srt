1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
okay here we're looking insect

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,528
management for squash because if you're

3
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:08,039
growing squash you're likely to see one

4
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:10,679
if not all four of these insects on your

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,058
plants first wears cucumber beetles I'm

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,070
going to start with they are small

7
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,100
yellow beetles with either black spots

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,679
or black stripes and they can start very

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,929
early in the season as early as first

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,850
week of May insect netting is a good

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,368
thing to cover your young seedlings with

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,960
to act as a physical barrier organically

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,778
they can be controlled with gigantic or

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,250
surround or chemically

15
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:34,890
7.now while they are small there's

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,420
rarely just one and they will devastate

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,719
leaves and they are very voracious

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,100
eaters so important to keep monitoring

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,670
your plants especially when they're

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,469
small squash bugs is another one to look

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,359
out for there are large brown beetles

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,429
and have almost an armor plating to them

23
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,100
when they're crushed they so like sour

24
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:56,100
apple really small reddish tannish eggs

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,660
and often laid in clusters how to

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,460
prevent these the same thing in set

27
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,308
netting is the only real option they're

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,600
very difficult to control organically by

29
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:06,599
Ganic may have some effectiveness

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,790
chemically 7 but it does not really work

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,169
that well on adults you want to spray

32
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,170
them at the end in stage because they're

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,460
much easier to control at this stage the

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,109
products work a little bit better that

35
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,530
armor plating kind of shields them from

36
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,118
some of the chemicals insecticides give

37
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,890
you a size comparison this is a spotted

38
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,719
cucumber beetle so you can see the

39
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,049
relative size comparison of these squash

40
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,328
bugs adult and thence to a spotted

41
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,850
cucumber beetle now their squash vine

42
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:34,289
borers their large black moths that are

43
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,298
mostly active around the mid part of the

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,579
day I prevent them to be a physical

45
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,680
barrier like insect netting or you could

46
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,569
plant butternut squash they have solid

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,939
vines and they're immune to squash vine

48
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,398
borers now the moths don't really do the

49
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,139
damage they'll a single eggs throughout

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,359
the plant typically on the lower leaf

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,859
stocks or the vine itself what happens

52
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,590
from the end of small grub will hatch

53
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,030
and borrow a burrow into the vine and

54
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,250
eat it from the inside out

55
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,840
they like to lay this eggs at the base

56
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,109
of the plant and they're extremely hard

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,850
to spot and typically see this orange

58
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,438
kind of frass and that could be an

59
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,919
indication if you have a grub inside

60
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,930
especially if the plant starts to wilt

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,709
he feeds another concern with a lack in

62
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,770
size

63
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,450
for in numbers very small black or tan

64
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,310
or white or clear specs is what you're

65
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,949
looking for this kind of shows that very

66
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,900
small how they can look here on the

67
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,669
inner side of leaves if you find

68
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,909
bumblebees in an area and it's devoid of

69
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:31,769
flowers look closer oftentimes this is a

70
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,049
high site of a fan feeding because

71
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,780
they're releasing plant sugars that the

72
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,790
bumblebees are feeding on you can use

73
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,610
reflective plastic we block to help

74
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:43,679
repel athens they can be very difficult

75
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,330
to control spring garlic based sprays

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,580
can help with pain we can tell them

77
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,730
there's also biological control such as

78
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,090
green lacings which can help actively

79
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:56,429
kind of insect insect bio control them

80
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,229
but they are very small and they do have

81
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,250
a lot of numbers and they can do severe

82
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,250
damage to your crops
