1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,939
okay here we look at the process of gel

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,440
electrophoresis this takes the DNA

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,540
fragments that are multiplied through

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,670
the process of PCR and I have another

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,949
video on that and separating them

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,500
through literally a gel-like substance

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,719
and this is separating out those DNA

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,109
fragments based on their relative size

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,028
to one another so where this may be used

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,660
we can typically see this being used

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,460
potentially for paternity tests forensic

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,649
science things like that or how they

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,120
determined who the father is this

14
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,710
process could be used for this purpose

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:42,869
what the basic setup looks like in the

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,750
lab is a gel and a power source because

17
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,718
we're using electricity to separate out

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,609
the DNA we need a power source so here's

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
the power source DNA actually has a

20
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,750
negative charge on its backbone this

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,960
allows us to have a positive charge

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,039
located here and that will actually pull

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,929
the DNA down through the gel we notice

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,969
here the larger fragments kind of stay

25
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,760
closer to where we initially put the

26
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,099
well here for our DNA and then the

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,260
smaller fragments are actually traveling

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:17,030
further through the gel material and

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,978
getting closer to that positive charge

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,950
the gel electrophoresis again looking at

31
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:25,530
our molecular size which BP stands for

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,939
base pairs and we could see here the

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,040
distance migrated the greater the

34
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,889
distance migrated the smaller the

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,020
molecular size and we see that evident

36
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,939
here here's our marker which is just an

37
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,459
area where we have known fragments of

38
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,889
DNA and we're seeing it separated out

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,629
here keeping in mind those smaller base

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,569
pairs only 100 base pairs are going

41
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,569
further than those at 902 or a thousand

42
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,590
DNA is cut with restriction enzymes so I

43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,719
have a video also on restriction enzymes

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,570
that you may want to take a look at it's

45
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,129
cutting the DNA at very specific

46
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:02,039
sequences this has many applications

47
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,688
such as forensics paternity testing

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,129
medical diagnosis evolutionary

49
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:09,389
relationships and many more so comparing

50
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,219
the cut-up DNA how are the fragments

51
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,279
compared how the fragment separated

52
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,830
they're actually

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
based on their size and their base pair

54
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,000
of lengths is this specific how are

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,729
looking at size run through a gel

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,068
substance and you can see here is

57
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:26,840
literally gel like and it looks like

58
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:28,369
initially when we look the straight

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,219
lines it looks like they all ran into

60
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,770
the same spot well actually that is just

61
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:36,169
the dye and that was what called the gel

62
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,590
front that is just showing you basically

63
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:41,958
the furthest that the dye has moved

64
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,640
through that gel these are just an idea

65
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,989
where the fragments are moving but there

66
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,238
will be little lines here and we have

67
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:52,099
ways of marking them in indicating where

68
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,539
those bands may be located so I

69
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,549
mentioned that DNA had a negative charge

70
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:58,479
and it does that negative charge comes

71
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,850
from the oxygen which is on our

72
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,609
phosphorous backbone here so nothing to

73
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,560
do with the nucleotide bases nothing to

74
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,390
do with the sugar backbone and

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,569
particularly the oxygens on the

76
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:14,208
phosphate backbone that's what's causing

77
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:15,979
the negative charge we notice here this

78
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,110
is a gel run on its side and we have our

79
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:21,609
positive charge here and our negative

80
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,680
charge down here so when we add our

81
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,440
solution of different DNA fragments we

82
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,989
add them to the well and we can see that

83
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:33,500
we can see that here and then the larger

84
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,819
ones are not able to run as far they're

85
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,150
bigger and they kind of get caught up in

86
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:40,519
this gel then smaller ones are able to

87
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,039
run further or closer to this positive

88
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,159
charge so the smaller they are the

89
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,108
further down the gels are going to run

90
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,729
and it's syndicate swimming through gel

91
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,840
the bigger ones are going to have a

92
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,798
harder time and they're not going to

93
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,659
move quite as far how this looks how we

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
compare these fragments well I mentioned

95
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,109
this DNA ladder the smaller piece is

96
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,659
moving further larger pieces we've been

97
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,329
slower and lag behind the DNA ladders

98
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,009
look is loaded into one of the gels what

99
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:11,390
that ladder is is there's an image of it

100
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:13,060
here it has known DNA base pair links so

101
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,478
we know what bands it's going to produce

102
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,699
this allows us to compare our unknown or

103
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,949
even our known segment segments to

104
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,810
figure out how many base pairs long they

105
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:25,639
are the same process here they fill the

106
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,780
well up the ladder this relevance will

107
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,579
enter the end

108
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,709
and the larger ones will run more

109
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,000
towards the beginning here this is

110
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:34,519
evident here we have a thousand base

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,029
pairs here's 500 base pairs and here's

112
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,639
100 base pairs when we're loading that

113
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,229
actual gel they're actually depressions

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
in there we're learning that mixture of

115
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,210
DNA be sure to load these slowly so no

116
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,770
sample is lost it's a very small area

117
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,079
you want to make sure that we fill that

118
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:52,430
with our sample and shows it kind of on

119
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,709
this side here should filling up that

120
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,050
sample on the side I'm careful not to

121
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,310
lose any and see another well right here

122
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,259
otherwise that's going to cause a

123
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,470
reduction in the amount of sample that

124
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,180
couldn't run through that gel the basic

125
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,150
process it can be vertical or horizontal

126
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,650
those gels taking our sample here's

127
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,049
contains our DNA we take our micro

128
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:14,089
pipettor we're adding it to the wells we

129
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,250
add a charge to it and then that's

130
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:19,250
simply over time allowing it to separate

131
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,259
out that's important do not run it too

132
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,939
long as far as time goes because

133
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,860
literally all of your samples will run

134
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,959
out of the gel you want to run it so

135
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,550
they all separate but so they don't

136
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,529
leave the gel you want to keep them in

137
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,550
the gel so you're able to compare them

138
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:36,709
running into all the DNA's cut with

139
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,000
restriction enzymes so that's what's

140
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:40,609
giving the different fragments or

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,620
different sizes to stay in the DNA with

142
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,270
atheneum bromide it binds the DNA and

143
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,740
it's fluorescent under UV light

144
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:51,019
and so causes it to glow the Athenian

145
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,819
bromide remember it binds with DNA and

146
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,349
cause mutations so that's why you always

147
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,029
want to be wearing gloves it was working

148
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,830
with Athena bromide but what makes it

149
00:05:56,029 --> 00:06:00,168
really neat is that it causes DNA to

150
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:04,039
glow under UV light and it causes these

151
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:07,209
nice little bright bars or lines this is

152
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,879
indicating these size and the relative

153
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:12,439
position of those DNA fragments again

154
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,240
the smaller ones will move further down

155
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,250
this small smaller ones will move

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,829
further the larger ones will stay closer

157
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,990
to the actual well I'm using a lab take

158
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:23,750
extreme caution diffusing this because

159
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,009
it is it does mutate your DNA we can

160
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,740
take a picture this was very special

161
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:31,069
cameras and be able to tell us a little

162
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,350
bit about the DNA and if we're comparing

163
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:36,639
samples we can develop a DNA fingerprint

164
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,640
which is another video
