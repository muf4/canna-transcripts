1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,448
okay so here I'm gonna go over forensic

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,940
photography methods and things you might

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:07,830
want to be considering and this is some

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,839
things that make it advantageous if you

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,000
get a camera that allows you to adjust

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,980
some features it's gonna really allow

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,539
you to maximize the shot consider you

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,190
can't move the object or change a lot of

9
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,899
things by just in the camera you can

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,740
capture the information of the image

11
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:25,679
that you need so starting first general

12
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,778
methods looking at all photographs must

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,969
contain three elements the subject scale

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,800
and a reference object and we have a

15
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,140
prime example the footprint here was

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,750
nice scale cuz I got the subject got a

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,450
reference object included a website here

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,980
at the bottom that at the time of

19
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,690
videotaping this video here this was

20
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,269
active and it allows you to print out

21
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,250
something just like this to allow you to

22
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,620
include this in any images that you may

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,329
take or want to practice with it's a

24
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,759
great way to kind of have color

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,899
correction have size have scale of

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,108
contrast really allows a set distance so

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,579
really allows you to add a lot of these

28
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:06,240
elements to the photograph such new your

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,969
take so what should our crime-scene

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,829
photograph should contain what well as

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,069
we can kind of see in the images here

32
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,269
they should always be in focus so in the

33
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,739
case it's kind of easy when they're in a

34
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,060
controlled environment but we don't want

35
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,280
to move them so we need to make sure

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,200
that they are in focus they also need to

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,478
be kind of the main object within the

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,100
photograph again it's been photographs

39
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,289
or taking notes particularly talking

40
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,298
about the object contain a scale or

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,880
ruler so as we can see in these images

42
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,829
while they are listed is 45 they all

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,890
contain that nice scale allowing us to

44
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,929
know the exact size of that object and

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,228
also it number tags it which is great

46
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,939
for organization purposes that skill or

47
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,269
ruler having a little right angle here

48
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:51,298
also helps be a fair and accurate

49
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:52,978
representation of what is seen so while

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,229
we have that as our main object what's

51
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:58,019
around it or where it may occur be or be

52
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,849
placed or be left also important any

53
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:01,950
change in color may miss identify an

54
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,390
object or investigators and pusle jurors

55
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,579
so this is why we want to have our

56
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,360
photographs be as accurate to true light

57
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:11,340
as possible so which one of these is the

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,470
best representation so we have a couple

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,229
options here we have photograph

60
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,759
one photograph to a photograph - is the

61
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:19,139
correct representation so a lot of

62
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,099
people look at photograph one see that's

63
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,869
a little bit brighter

64
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,909
well you're losing some of the detail

65
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,230
photograph one is too much light means

66
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,969
that the photograph her failed to catch

67
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,709
the proper light to describe the object

68
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,659
by just in the flash photograph or

69
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,480
should have just camera flash to capture

70
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,069
the object in the detail as well you

71
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,319
might want this level of detail and

72
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,459
scale is if I took this out here and

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,109
just kind of took a picture of the

74
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,969
turtle you would know if that's an adult

75
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,370
large turtle or small turtle by putting

76
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,020
some hands showing how small it is

77
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,110
that gives us that perspective or that

78
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,810
correct representation so be mindful

79
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,370
here's two objects the exact same but

80
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,680
that's slight difference of cutting down

81
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,840
the light really takes into account a

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,640
lot more of the detail now when taking

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,620
the photographs now with the digital age

84
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,539
we are taking a lot of photographs which

85
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,849
is great but we also need to keep a

86
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,400
photographic log this should be done as

87
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,349
you're taking the pictures responding

88
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,670
officer must also maintain this log of

89
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,560
any photographic evidence that it's

90
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,419
taken should contain the date the time

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,129
of the of the photograph the subject

92
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,259
matter in any additional notes it should

93
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,969
be done in order and also who took those

94
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,069
pictures very important there's two

95
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,959
people taking pictures these lots must

96
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,579
be maintained within a case file or

97
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,979
incident report as they are part of the

98
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,830
examination record and discoverable

99
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,859
material at trial it's important as much

100
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,120
as people don't like to this to be

101
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,070
updating this log as you're taking the

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,269
pictures you may stumble across

103
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,859
something in a different direction

104
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,539
whenever you're making sure that you're

105
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,010
kind of always making that subject in

106
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,459
those comments as your date in the

107
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:52,349
pictures those three components of

108
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,640
photography there's ISO shutter speed

109
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,019
and aperture and it's just kind of a

110
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,539
great way of kind of creating a quick

111
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,340
little comparison aperture or small

112
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,349
aperture will get a further depth of

113
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,229
field larger after it tends to focus

114
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,400
more closer shutter speed the faster the

115
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,349
shutter speed you can stop a moving

116
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,209
object the slower the shutter speed will

117
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,189
blur an object if it is moving

118
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,650
typically on crime scenes the objects

119
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:15,269
aren't moving all that fast ISO low

120
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,189
sensitivity and high sense that even get

121
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,530
a little bit more greening potentially

122
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:23,339
depending on other factors that may be

123
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,199
be using with our cameras so ISO just to

124
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,159
start here International Organization

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,060
for Standardization

126
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,580
really

127
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,990
the human sensitivity to light back in

128
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,209
the days of film there was they were

129
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,310
stolen different is OS but this creates

130
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:37,829
a great contrast ii-era photograph one

131
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,839
photograph to shutter speeds the same

132
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,519
focus is the same but the ISO is

133
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,319
different here's ISO of a hundred you

134
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,750
can barely make that object out here

135
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,490
1600 it's very clear in dark

136
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,199
environments that ISO makes light sensor

137
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,910
of the camera more sensitive so

138
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,620
increasing the ISO will allow this in a

139
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,510
dark environment to show quite well I

140
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,060
saw there's a high possibility to make

141
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,620
careful nose which is kind of blurriness

142
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,569
which can cause that visual distortion

143
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,819
too much dependence on ISO can distort

144
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,829
the image so knowing your camera knowing

145
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,659
how to adjust certain things is great if

146
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,819
you're left with only adjusting ISO

147
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,139
though as least as possible so you don't

148
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,610
get noise and distortion for your images

149
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,500
shutter speed shutter speed is the

150
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,970
length of time when the film or the

151
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,610
digital sensor inside the camera is

152
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,660
exposed to light so here we have a slow

153
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,340
shutter speed to get that kind of

154
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,680
smoothing of the water that kind of

155
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,269
cascade effect which are tuned is shot

156
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,060
with different shutter speeds when when

157
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:31,620
25th the second one 400 these two

158
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,079
photographs taken are the same situation

159
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,668
except the shutter speed is changed this

160
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,399
slow shutter speed makes image more

161
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,870
clear and bright because the low shutter

162
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,759
speed takes in more light than the

163
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,079
higher shutter speed however high

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
shutter speed is often necessary for

165
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,769
moving objects but in this case we see

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,629
kind of can make out one fingerprint

167
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,519
sort of pended here here we can make up

168
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,918
that one for sure but also several

169
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,839
others also the ruler is much clearer

170
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,089
visible here allowed us to get a better

171
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,829
idea of the size of that object so

172
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,750
here's an example of adjusting shutter

173
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:05,399
speed and how it can vastly impact the

174
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:07,500
image aperture or focus so aperture

175
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,899
means the extent with the sharpness of

176
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,149
an image is shown with the lens here we

177
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,969
can see list of candle or a line of

178
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:17,788
candles one two three four all pretty

179
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,350
well in focus here the first one is a

180
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:20,879
little blurry the second one looks great

181
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,960
third one's a little blurry and the

182
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,909
fourth one definitely starting

183
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,288
definitely the background so photograph

184
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,900
one all objects are very clearly visible

185
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:29,519
with a high aperture to the image shows

186
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,779
an object with the right focus but the

187
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,430
rest of the evidence are all blurred

188
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,418
because of low aperture this would be

189
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,889
important if this is the one you're

190
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:36,418
looking at focusing on for some reason

191
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,300
but this tells a little bit better story

192
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,889
of where these objects are and what is

193
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
also located behind them

194
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,098
so it's important if you have a pitcher

195
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,270
and focus in mind which might be limited

196
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:50,878
based on the light and other factors

197
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:52,589
lastly the flash we're looking at flash

198
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,300
of the cameras white balance of the

199
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:55,978
photo flash and it's set to mimic

200
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,879
daylight to ensure proper color balance

201
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,800
of this subject matter

202
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,800
be mindful though of reflections

203
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,960
particularly of glass objects or shiny

204
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,050
objects that can occur due to the flash

205
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,370
here we have the flashes indirect you

206
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,560
can take the flash point upwards in the

207
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,968
ceiling here it's directly on the image

208
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,978
if you could see how it really distorts

209
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:16,168
it this adds enough light so you can see

210
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,449
in detail but doesn't distort anything

211
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:19,799
then they have any reflections because

212
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,000
this can demonstrate its flash it's

213
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,860
either removed from the camera body

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,050
creating the angle or bounced off the

215
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,848
ceiling or some other object because you

216
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,800
want it to be well lit but you do not

217
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:32,310
want it to distort or kind of cause that

218
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,168
blurriness to occur due to the flash so

219
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,639
there's just some important key items to

220
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:39,389
keep in mind when we're looking at

221
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,610
studying our photography skills and

222
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,038
making sure that we're capturing quality

223
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,759
images that really depict what was seen

224
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,759
at the crime scene
