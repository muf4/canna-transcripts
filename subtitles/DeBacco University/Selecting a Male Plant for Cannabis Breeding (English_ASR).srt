1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,439
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,359
video

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,599
here we'll be looking at selecting a

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,879
male plant for cannabis breeding it's a

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,558
question often asked well how they go

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
about selecting the male plant

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,678
we're going to go through and breed two

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,679
cannabis plants so

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,519
hopefully this video will provide you

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,679
with a little bit more information

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,800
if you're looking at going down this

12
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,879
path

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
so first off there are some first off

14
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,118
there are some challenges with

15
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,278
male plants because often growers are

16
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,640
breeding for traits that are specific to

17
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,558
female plants

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
but there are there needs to be a

19
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,919
pollinator chosen

20
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
so selecting a quality pollinator that

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,800
may not exhibit the specific desired

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,479
traits

23
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,558
can be part of the challenge in the

24
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,238
breeding process however there are some

25
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,159
key aspects to look for

26
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,919
and document as part of your breeding

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,959
process and hopefully i'll be able to

28
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,679
provide you

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
with some information regarding that so

30
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,519
first off we want to consider the meal

31
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,000
plans morphology morphology to keep in

32
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
mind is the basic structure of the plant

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,119
morphology is important since the goal

34
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,640
is to maintain a plant structure that

35
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,878
can support itself

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,478
while producing the necessary compounds

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,439
if you have a plant that produces great

38
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,359
compounds

39
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,959
but is a very spindly weak kind of

40
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,478
structure or morphology

41
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,798
that can be a very negative when you're

42
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,478
looking at the breeding process so again

43
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
male plant morphology is definitely

44
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,799
something to document and to consider

45
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
i want to be considering the branching

46
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,720
and also the internode

47
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
spacing for how dense of a plant that it

48
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,039
might be producing or contributing to

49
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,879
the genetics of your breeding project

50
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,880
in addition male plants can still

51
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,319
produce terpenes and while they may not

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,319
end up in the flower

53
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,839
in great concentrations if you kind of

54
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,319
rub the stem

55
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
this can help indicate what terpene

56
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,679
profile

57
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,879
that plant may produce this can be used

58
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
to help the grower determine what

59
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,078
compounds the male plant may have

60
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,199
for the initial phase of selection again

61
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:52,559
if you're going through it's important

62
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,719
to kind of like isolate one

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
area rub the stem to begin the lower

64
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,599
part and you'll get an idea of what that

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,478
terpene profile

66
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,239
might be there's also plant vigor so

67
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,599
aggressively growing plants can help the

68
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,759
breeding process

69
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,798
and this help the growing in general can

70
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,439
have a really nice

71
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,760
healthy robust looking quick growing

72
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,959
highly vigorous plant so this is another

73
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,000
consideration

74
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
when looking at male plants then we have

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,878
the pollen production it's probably the

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
number one reason why we're considering

77
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:21,679
male plants is

78
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,759
they're pollen for breeding purposes

79
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
while pollen is needed selecting males

80
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,560
that are

81
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,799
high pollen producers can help increase

82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
the overall usage of the plants

83
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
and limit the total number of male

84
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,759
plants needed to grow

85
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,959
so male male plants will produce pollen

86
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,959
but if you're selecting some that

87
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
produce higher rates of pollen

88
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
that can allow growers to grow less male

89
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
plants have

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
greater control so that is another trait

91
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,840
to kind of look for

92
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,919
that might be advantageous in the

93
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,840
breeding process

94
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,839
now male plants producing female flowers

95
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,800
and i put kind of a question mark there

96
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,920
and there is uh it is possible to kind

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,120
of go through with a reversal

98
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,359
epithelium induced feminization in male

99
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
plants of cannabis sativa by ethylene

100
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,159
antagonist

101
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:11,679
so interaction between f ephron

102
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,759
and two ethylene antagonist one silver

103
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,239
nitrate another cobalt chloride

104
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,399
applied exogenously meaning to the

105
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,680
exterior of the plant to the male

106
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,719
cannabis sativa plant

107
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,480
was studied the feminization effect was

108
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,000
caused by two sprays

109
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:31,919
of 960 milligrams per liter

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,039
of ephron can could be overcome by 100

111
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,280
micrograms

112
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,158
of that's silver nitrate or cobalt

113
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
chloride

114
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,239
however neither of the antagonists could

115
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,000
suppress the feminization effect

116
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,280
of 1920 milligrams per liter

117
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,799
of ephron sprayed twice this is again

118
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,158
a way that male plants can produce

119
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
female flowers this might be

120
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,519
advantageous

121
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,518
in your breeding process to kind of go

122
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
through and determine

123
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,759
where that might be advantageous if you

124
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
look in the description there should be

125
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,399
a

126
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
link to this particular research paper

127
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,680
that you're welcome to go

128
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
and investigate further if you're

129
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,799
looking at some of the details of this

130
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,598
study then there's also the requirement

131
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,640
of official

132
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,399
lab testing so testing promising male

133
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,000
plants via a professional lab is

134
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,519
important to get the cannabinoid and

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,279
terpene profiles

136
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
this should be a very targeted and

137
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,319
selective process

138
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,919
unless you have a very large budget you

139
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,040
want to be very selective on the plants

140
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,279
that you're choosing

141
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
to potentially breed further and send

142
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,918
those off

143
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,360
for independent lab testing and

144
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,680
independent plant testing

145
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,840
this can help you have a track record

146
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
and a great kind of documentation as far

147
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,159
as what that plant produced

148
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
for continuation of breeding or maybe

149
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
for elimination

150
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,160
of breeding if it did not produce what

151
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,639
you were considered to be desirable

152
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
and then lastly typically many people

153
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,120
grow male plants produce the pollen and

154
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,560
then cull them

155
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,560
you really want to let the male plants

156
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,199
complete their full growth cycle if

157
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
possible

158
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
do not simply cut them down once they

159
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
produce the pollen needed letting the

160
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
plants go through a natural growth style

161
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,119
can help provide some more information

162
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,120
on how these genes may perform at the

163
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
end of the growth cycle which could be

164
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,079
important

165
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
this can be important for female plant

166
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,959
production and harvest

167
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,720
and just something else to consider

168
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,399
instead of just chopping down that flour

169
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
does it get powdery mildew late does it

170
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,879
have other sort of issues later in the

171
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,038
growing cycle

172
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,918
other important notes that as a breeder

173
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,519
