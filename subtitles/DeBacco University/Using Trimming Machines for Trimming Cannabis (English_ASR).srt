1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
if you're looking at utilizing some sort

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,080
of machine or mechanized

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,400
uh form of trimming your cannabis plants

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
this debaco university video will go

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,359
over

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,639
some of the basics and let you know some

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,160
of the options that exist

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
as well as some of the advantages and

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,920
disadvantages of each

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,000
[Music]

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,879
all right let's get into using trimming

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,960
machines for trimming cannabis plants

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,238
so first off we're looking at blood

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,520
trimming machine options there's two

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,320
main options and they're

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
dry and wet trimming machines so this is

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,799
going to depend on

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
your chosen basic method after soon

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,119
after harvest

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,119
in addition there are also different

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,479
sizes to best match the operation

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,759
but at first you need to determine are

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,439
you looking at more of a dry trimming

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,039
machine or do you have the option

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,479
to harvest your plants and dry them and

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,399
then trim them we're going to be doing a

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,000
direct kind of harvest trim

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,520
that's going to be the main separation

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,479
between these two

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
so when we're looking at trimming

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,119
machine options to consider as i said

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,520
wet and dry trimming

33
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
and then there are subsets below there

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
so there's many different options

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,879
just going to cover a basic overview

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,439
that you can go through and research

37
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,158
further

38
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,839
once you have a chosen path so first off

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
looking at just the wet trimming options

40
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
well wet trimming machines allow you to

41
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,399
trim

42
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,960
more and save more space since you will

43
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,719
not need to hang flowers by their stem

44
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,239
to allow them to go through a drying

45
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,879
process saves you time it saves you

46
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,559
space

47
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,319
sometimes wet trimming is sometimes a

48
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,118
necessity particularly in larger growing

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,798
facilities

50
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,959
is they have tight time schedules of

51
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
turnaround time incorporating a wet trim

52
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,640
machine will result in faster harvest

53
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
process and reduces the amount of space

54
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
it takes to dry your plants on the stem

55
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,599
after your initial

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,519
plant takedown it's an important

57
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,879
consideration there

58
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,640
now what are some of the advantages of

59
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,399
what showing machines well wet trimming

60
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,320
machines have increased speed which is

61
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
typically a main goal for commercial or

62
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,199
large scale growers

63
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
there's also space savings do the

64
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
reduced plant material that is

65
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,438
needed to be dried so that can save you

66
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,399
areas on your dry room or really cut

67
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,319
down on the

68
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
volume of material that's going to end

69
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,319
up in the dry room causing you to have

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,159
more control over your drying area

71
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,799
however disadvantages are reduced trim

72
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,639
quality

73
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
because of the breaking of wet plant

74
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,839
cells it's also

75
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
not so good for potentially for

76
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,598
concentrates and the flowers can have a

77
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,439
green taste and smell to them

78
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,439
a lot of times these negatives are these

79
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,439
disadvantages are reasons why people

80
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,280
select not to go with the wet trimming

81
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,878
option as their main option

82
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,159
however there are dry trimming machines

83
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,598
and sometimes these are used as an

84
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,280
initial way to kind of take down some of

85
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,280
the plant material

86
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,280
and these dry chicken machines will trim

87
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
with dry plant material as recommended

88
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
because of the trichomes will be

89
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,360
preserved

90
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,199
during the process so when we're looking

91
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
at that other option that dry trimming

92
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,318
option

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,598
utilizing dry trims as the name implies

94
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,839
again dry plate material

95
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,359
but is recommended simply because the

96
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
trichomes are preserved during this

97
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
process and they're kind of more

98
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
degraded or injured shall we say with

99
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,159
the wet trimming process

100
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
there's many machines like i got a

101
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,079
couple listed here

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,439
for the best results we see a couple

103
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,319
listed here and we'll go through some of

104
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,759
these in more detail within this video

105
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,119
so what are the disadvantages and

106
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,158
advantages kind of when we're looking at

107
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,920
dry trimming

108
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,199
well with the advantage of dry trimming

109
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,958
or that there's many different options

110
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,839
or styles to best fit the needs of a

111
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,598
grower

112
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,519
and they cut closer than wet trimmers

113
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,439
since no but size reduction

114
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
due to the moisture content so a little

115
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,878
tighter tolerances

116
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,400
this also includes improved quality over

117
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,158
the wet trimming process

118
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
however the disadvantages to using a dry

119
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,079
trim machine or just dry trimming in

120
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,840
general

121
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
it does take a bit more space since you

122
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,239
will need to hang your flowers from the

123
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,318
stem to dry

124
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
uh to allow them that process to go from

125
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,439
the wet to the dry then once they reach

126
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,318
the dry then they can be utilized with

127
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,039
these machines

128
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,839
that duration of time that location that

129
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,359
labor

130
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
should all be factored in when you're

131
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
making that decision

132
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,560
now there are different types of

133
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,840
machines here so we're looking initially

134
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,598
at a tumbler style

135
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
trimmer these template styles are the

136
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,000
most popular style and work by rotating

137
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,719
the flowers around its electrical tube

138
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
allowing for a close trim twister

139
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,799
trimming machines are common because

140
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,519
they are made for production they can

141
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,280
scale by placing multiple units in line

142
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
and adding an automatic feed conveyor so

143
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,438
you can actually link these together

144
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
and go right through and really make

145
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,399
this process

146
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,840
very efficient sims are also referred to

147
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,560
as tumblers or trauma styles because

148
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,599
they are

149
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,959
rotating like a gold mining trommel for

150
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
example

151
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,079
now the advantage and disadvantage of

152
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,519
this tumbler style was that the

153
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,918
advantages are very fast

154
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,359
the companies claim up to 45 pounds per

155
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,918
hour wet 16

156
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,439
pounds per hour dry they can trim both

157
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,839
wet and dry material

158
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,360
all of it the change of the tumbler and

159
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,758
they're scalable as their design can

160
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,600
handle

161
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,160
large batches of plant material making

162
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
them ideal for large scale operations

163
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
the disadvantage is the price of these

164
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
machines tend to be more than other

165
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
options available

166
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,680
so they can be initially cost

167
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,519
prohibitive but keep in mind of some of

168
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,879
these advantages when you're making your

169
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,399
decision

170
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,040
now there's bull style trimmers as we

171
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,638
see a couple uh pictured right here

172
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
bowl style trimmers are usually mainly

173
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,519
operated with a hand crank

174
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,800
that moves the flowers around the bowl

175
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,918
allowing them to come in contact with

176
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,759
the blades

177
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,959
unmade models can be used if you have

178
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,879
high plant volumes

179
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,000
i like the old salad kind of spinner

180
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,000
concept

181
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
now the advantages and disadvantages of

182
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
this type is that you can control the

183
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,840
speed via the hand crank

184
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
it's very affordable options and

185
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,879
balances efficiency

186
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,240
and cost so you're kind of getting a

187
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,319
blending of the two

188
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
however it can remove excessive plant

189
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,759
materials so keep that in mind

190
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,599
and this is really recommended only for

191
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
dry flowers wet flowers are gonna have a

192
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,320
tendency to clog

193
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,519
all of that and while it says variable

194
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,199
speed keep in mind you're the one

195
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,879
providing a lot of the motion

196
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,639
so it might be great the first couple of

197
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,279
times but you might be getting

198
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,478
tired or fatigued as you get through

199
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,359
especially a larger

200
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,959
harvest there are also then stand-up

201
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
trimmers so as the name implies they

202
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,079
actually they stand up

203
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,759
and are operated by manually slowly

204
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,478
moving the flowers back and forth over

205
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
the crate

206
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,478
with a fan running underneath catching

207
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,840
any material that passes through

208
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,199
so we could see these different types

209
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,560
but they're all gonna have the same

210
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,879
general category

211
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,639
why would someone utilize one of these

212
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,000
well the stand-up trimming

213
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
is that you can adjust the speed the

214
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
plant materials move through

215
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,639
while the blade remains at a constant

216
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,280
speed so you have a little bit more

217
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,439
control

218
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,879
and specificity with that the

219
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,478
disadvantages is your hands will end up

220
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,759
very close to moving blades

221
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,120
and that's why we see here like a

222
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,479
warning don't stick your hands down here

223
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,399
because there are moving blades

224
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,399
and this really also is advised for dry

225
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,839
trimming only simply because if you do

226
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,719
this with wet trimming you have a great

227
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,799
tendency of clogging this entire area

228
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
then we have also bag style trimmers so

229
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
these are operated by placing the

230
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
flowers

231
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,639
in the bag and rotating the bag in

232
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,639
different directions

233
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
so we see a couple different styles here

234
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,120
of bag style trimmers

235
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
growers usually select use a bag style

236
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,160
trimmer

237
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,560
since they have control of the bag since

238
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
they're mainly operated or mainly turned

239
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
they're very lightweight and compact for

240
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,319
easy storage if you're not doing a lot

241
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
of

242
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,360
perpetual harvesting they're affordable

243
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,598
and still

244
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,439
very effective however someone would

245
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,959
choose not to use a bag style trimmer

246
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,959
simply because flowers can break apart

247
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,918
due to physical shaking that occurs

248
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,439
and it is a labor intensive process so

249
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,478
hopefully this gives you kind of an idea

250
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,519
of some of the machines that are

251
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,560
available if you're looking at

252
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,758
considering these

253
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,000
to allow you to make an informed

254
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,439
decision at least as a category

255
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and then you can look specifically at

256
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,120
what brands or details or options you

257
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,240
might get within

258
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,240
that category
