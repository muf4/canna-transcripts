00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,400
on this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,529
going to go over using electricity to

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,629
heat a cannabis grow facility

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,629

[Music]

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,278
all right if you're thinking about using

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,920
electrical heat to heat your grow

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,439
facility

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,920
let's go over some of the details you

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,320
should be aware of well first off the

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,400
advantages of using electric heat

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,800
there's low installation cost there's

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,439
dependability with electric heat

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,239
it's application flexible quiet

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
operation

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,959
low maintenance and easy to service all

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,200
these sound like great advantages

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
for electric heat simple to connect to a

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
power supply there's usually power in

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,719
the facility anyway

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,519
do have to be careful about the wattage

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,600
requirements

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
of your size of your heater

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
dependability there's really no moving

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
parts so it's a great thing

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,238
there can be air deflector blades

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,799
installed to help control

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,159
airflow over the facility over the area

29
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,679
within the grow room

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,439
quiet operations you're not dealing with

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,719
any really loud noises

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,640
low maintenance because the motors are

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,840
totally enclosed thermally protected so

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
that's a great thing

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
and the fan motor are exposed usually

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
for easy access

37
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,240
if needed to be accessed now

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,400
the electric heat for individual grow

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,000
rooms for individual rooms themselves

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
having nearly instant heat in a grow

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,200
space is advantageous to prevent the

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
temperature from dipping too

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
low this type of heat source can also

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
allow for specific temperature targets

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
to be varied room to room

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,640
with different thermostats based on

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
different sections so that could really

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,159
one allow a grower to dial

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
in the heat in different rooms and also

50
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,320
try to minimize the cost of heating

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,920
those individual rooms

52
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,839
you want to check to be sure though when

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
you are going through and considering

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,719
electric heat

55
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,798
to make sure that the electrical system

56
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,519
can handle the addition of an electric

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,200
heater

58
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,399
always consider the worst case scenario

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,079
and that's where all of your electrical

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,200
systems are running at the same time

61
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,679
even though that might not be the

62
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
intention this includes your lights your

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
pumps your fans

64
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,640
and any addition to the heater that you

65
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,000
may have you don't want to have what's

66
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,879
going on looks like here we just start

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,239
plugging everything

68
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,359
in and oh if that works let me try

69
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,478
something else oh that's still working

70
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,239
let me try something else

71
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,598
you want to be mindful of exactly how

72
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
much amps

73
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,399
your system is drawing and what breaker

74
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
system you have everything hooked up to

75
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
lastly is again that word of caution

76
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
because we are talking about a grow

77
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,399
facility

78
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
within grow rooms there's always water

79
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,920
of some kind around

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,159
so just be sure to take extra

81
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,479
precautions to make sure that

82
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,598
it's kept isolated and away from areas

83
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,238
where electrical heat

84
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,159
is in general heaters tend to be large

85
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,080
consumers electricity to make sure they

86
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,239
do not come in contact with water

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
make sure there's distinct isolation and

88
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,719
separation

89
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,159
so you're providing the sufficient heat

90
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,919
that the grow facility needs

91
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,280
with the proper safety precautions in

92
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,719
place for both the plants

93
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,719
as well as the grower
