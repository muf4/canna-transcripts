1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
yeah I'm gonna discuss some of the very

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,580
important functions of the liver and

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:07,439
also feel need to mention the

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,388
gallbladder agency located here because

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,730
it is in such close proximity to the

6
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:14,279
liver so strong with deliver in general

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,528
liver is the largest internal organ of

8
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,868
the body it's about 3.3 pounds it's

9
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:21,660
divided into lobes it's the main

10
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:24,198
exocrine sufficient is bile and it aids

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,849
in the digestion of fats in the duodenum

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,250
now chemically modify substances and

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,829
absorbed in the GI tract and it converts

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,058
poisons into less toxic forms so it's a

15
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,189
very important function of the liver

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,119
this is why it's so large kind of like

17
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,679
the main filter it's a detoxifying of

18
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,869
r-tard some of the toxins that the body

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,909
takes in it's also one of the only

20
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,759
tissues that can regenerate itself

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,319
indicating its importance this tries to

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,659
show a little bit of its orientation in

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,159
the body and produces most of the

24
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,349
proteins found in the plasma of the

25
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,669
blood so it's okay right they're kind of

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,780
tucked up under your rib cage if you

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,620
feel under your rib cage you can

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,480
actually feel your liver now some very

29
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,879
important functions the liver is three

30
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,649
main ones all blood leaving the

31
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,938
absorbent surfaces of the digestive

32
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,750
tract so we have entering the Phanatic

33
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,489
portal system flows into the liver then

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,040
we have the liver cells extract

35
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:23,310
nutrients or toxins from the blood and

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,500
this is before they reach the systemic

37
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,840
circulatory system through the in patek

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,409
veins you see here this is kind of like

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,299
intermediate filter going through lastly

40
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,180
on the liver removes and stores excess

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,368
nutrients corrects nutrient deficiencies

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,618
by mobilizing stored reserves performing

43
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:43,049
synthetic activities so it's kind of not

44
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:46,259
only filtering things it's sensing and

45
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,659
regulating and changing so that our body

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,840
can do its best to Kent and maintain

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,189
homeostasis continuing on to give you a

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,228
little bit of that complexity the liver

49
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:58,889
regulates the composition of circulating

50
00:01:55,228 --> 00:02:00,239
blood waste product removal nutrient

51
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,180
balance and nutrients can be

52
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,228
carbohydrates lipids and amino acids

53
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,879
vitamins storage 18 E and K vitamins

54
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:11,370
nutrients urge for iron drug

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,289
inactivation and these are some of the

56
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,269
crazy pathways that go on

57
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:17,609
arose from defeat that occurs in these

58
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,769
lines here means that could block that

59
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,810
let's have some unknowns here indicating

60
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,879
some of the pathways here now they need

61
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,310
to know all the kind of complexities

62
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,068
here the cemetery inhibitory Tex now I

63
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,949
want you to understand some of the many

64
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:34,318
functions that deliver performs in

65
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:38,369
particular here's just six very

66
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:40,560
important regulations that it does the

67
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,200
the HEPA sites here the liver cells how

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,840
they function well they produce bile C a

69
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,530
bile duct right here on this processing

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,689
of blood-borne

71
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,000
nutrients and a storage of fat soluble

72
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,549
vitamins they're also important for that

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,259
detoxification step as you see here a

74
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,680
very good amount of surface area

75
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,750
allowing this to occur continuing on

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,790
what does the liver do I love that

77
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,250
question because there's about 500 vital

78
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:08,328
functions of the liver very hard to kind

79
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,859
of summarize them kind of only a couple

80
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:14,370
but I try to put like eight kind of

81
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,680
major ones here phagocytosis an antigen

82
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,319
presentation it removes damaged or old

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,629
red blood cells it synthesizes plasma

84
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,268
proteins such as albumin reabsorbs

85
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:26,818
hormone removes antibodies and converts

86
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:31,609
to amino acids traps um look at Seibel

87
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:35,219
toxins removes in stores certain toxins

88
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:38,489
so it's keeping the body clean and it

89
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:41,068
also synthesizes it secretes bile now

90
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,378
I'm inferring - toxins isn't like oh you

91
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:45,358
drink something toxic there's a lot of

92
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:46,560
potential harmful things that could

93
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,510
occur in the body especially at high

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,628
amounts it's helping clean some of that

95
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:53,909
up a lot of drugs that may be taking

96
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:56,969
prescription drugs usually go through

97
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,918
and are processed in the liver

98
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:02,430
since why a lot of times doctors will

99
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:05,250
check for liver they watch there's blood

100
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,949
liver levels and how that's kind of

101
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,019
operating that can be an indication of

102
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:13,229
some of the stresses that might be put

103
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,180
on it or some of the particular products

104
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:19,019
it might be putting into the blood

105
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,908
system as a reaction to something this

106
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,250
bile have been mentioning the functions

107
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:23,908
of IELTS dietary lipids are not water

108
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,069
soluble

109
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,149
the causal processing in the stomach

110
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,728
creates a large drop

111
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,469
it's containing lipids so removal of

112
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,930
bilirubin also results from the

113
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,080
breakdown of red blood cells breakdown

114
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,660
cholesterol pancreatic lipase is not

115
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,639
lipid soluble interacts only with the

116
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,600
surface droplet of the lipid so one

117
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,449
who's kind of like we call this

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,220
emulsifier or break that apart

119
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:50,400
increasing that surface area allowing

120
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:54,110
the by the better absorb or breakdown

121
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,109
these particular products

122
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,520
lastly bile salts break apart or

123
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,469
emulsify as I said the increases surface

124
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,139
area to allow enzymes to work a little

125
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,760
bit better these tiny droplets are

126
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,490
coated with bile salts and that's what

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,659
helps only those enzymes to be able to

128
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,978
perform their function la sites have

129
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,439
mentioned the gallbladder and that's is

130
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:18,209
kind of it's uh green and these images

131
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,819
here so okay to kind of that right

132
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:22,439
behind the liver there that's

133
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,899
pear-shaped it's a muscular sac it's

134
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,610
stores some concentrates bile prior to

135
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,519
excretion into the duodenum of the small

136
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,500
intestine via this bile duct so you can

137
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,149
see here's our pancreas again here's our

138
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,098
gallbladder and here's our piled up

139
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:36,689
entering the duodenum does the first

140
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:39,899
beginning part in the small intestine

141
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:42,779
and dealing with the time as it

142
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:45,899
immediately enters or exits I should say

143
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:48,779
the stomach on the syste extension the

144
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,029
gallbladder and this is allowing this

145
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:55,339
bile to be immediately released into the

146
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:55,339
beginning part of the small intestine
