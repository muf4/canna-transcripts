1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,480
so in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,519
going to go over mechanically harvesting

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,600
cannabis plants

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,519
more commonly done with industrial hemp

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:17,509
but to give you some details

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:20,480
about exactly how this process occurs

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,760
[Music]

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,839
all right let's get into mechanical

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
canvas plant takedown options

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,079
regarding for harvest so first off using

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,160
harvesting equipment

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,678
it is advised for large scale operations

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,960
doing whole plant harvesting because it

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:33,679
just makes the process a whole lot

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,679
easier

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,519
while the basic concept and idea are the

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,799
same there are different mechanical

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,239
options to growers

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,000
and you should be aware of them so

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,399
you're making sure you select the proper

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
one

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,320
to fit your particular growing

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
environment so as we said there's

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,439
different types of equipment we see a

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,039
couple pictured here

26
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,878
there are different options so be sure

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
you select the one that's a good fit for

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,238
your particular operation

29
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,238
remember that canvas has a more

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,799
wood-like kind of fibers in a tobacco

31
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,119
plant

32
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,479
so the same equipment is not advised

33
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,679
just because you've got a lot of tobacco

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,959
equipment don't think you can just go

35
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,478
right down your cannabis field and

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,158
harvest it in the same way

37
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,599
a lot of growers sadly learned the hard

38
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,600
way that the

39
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,759
a lot of damage can be done to their

40
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,199
tobacco harvesting equipment so make

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,560
sure it's specialized or

42
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,159
at least tested on specifically cannabis

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
growers who have tried to use the same

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
equipment because plants are similar as

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
i said have

46
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
cut severe damage to their tobacco

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,920
equipment avoid this frustration and

48
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,680
added cost

49
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
make sure you're spending time with the

50
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,280
actual crop you intend on harvesting

51
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
just because it looks the same doesn't

52
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
mean you can be harvested in exactly the

53
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,559
same way

54
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,240
with the exact same equipment the basic

55
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
process though is the same the goal

56
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,920
of the machine is to cut down remove and

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
temporarily store the canvas plant

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
um on the way to the trim or drying

59
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,839
process whatever the grower's

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
choosing hemp harvesters utilize a

61
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
tractor with an implement mounted in the

62
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,359
front

63
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,239
side or even back the tractor many

64
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,799
different options

65
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,319
but utilizing mainly a tractor some

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,920
maintain the entire plant others will

67
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,359
chop the plant into small pieces and

68
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
others will mow the plant at different

69
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,759
heights

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
as we saw in kind of the last slide

71
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,000
there the method you select should be

72
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
based on your intended drying process

73
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
and end product that you intend to

74
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,079
produce because depending on

75
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
where that product is going to end up

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
what kind of you need to produce in the

77
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,640
end

78
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,400
may choose how you choose only choose

79
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,639
how you go about selecting

80
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,879
the harvest process that's the best fit

81
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,000
for your situation

82
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,598
plan the end at the beginning as i say

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
if you're utilizing mechanical

84
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,280
harvesting at the end of the season

85
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
keep this in mind when you're planting

86
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,159
having plants in straight rows and

87
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,079
equally spaced apart

88
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,159
will really help the process in the end

89
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,959
of the season when the plants are quite

90
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,120
large

91
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
so this is just again paying a little

92
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,039
extra attention to detail that planting

93
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,760
process that springtime

94
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,598
can really save you a lot of frustration

95
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,719
at the end of the season

96
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,799
so if you're going through mechanically

97
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,239
hard saying just make sure extra sure

98
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
you're kind of in straight pros

99
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
to allow the ease of the equipment to

100
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,199
actually benefit you in helping the

101
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,158
process

102
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,560
instead of becoming more of a

103
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,840
frustration and hindering the efficiency

104
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
of your operation
