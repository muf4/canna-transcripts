1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,240
within growing media what's becoming

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:08,000
very popular now is having companies add

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,500
biological components to their mixes

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,419
biological clones to include fungi or

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,400
abet our bacteria funny being

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,460
mycorrhizae or Trichoderma species

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,109
doctoring being vassilis if you put in

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,630
on the petri dishes he may look

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,000
something like this but they can to add

10
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:27,479
them to help benefit the plant or reduce

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,250
pathogens is the goal so these pre and

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,839
Acula it mixes while there's some

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,210
advantages to potentially reducing

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,250
pathogens typically would be best to add

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,770
the material yourself you know see here

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,619
for example this pro mix has mycorrhizae

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,870
added these are living components all

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,689
have a shelf life and it's best to add

19
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,058
fresh material that you know if it's

20
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,308
within the stated shelf life so for

21
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,468
example if you're buying your soilless

22
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,359
mix here in large bulk and you're only

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,429
using a portion of it and you're saving

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,058
it the shelf life of those microbes

25
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:03,149
could degrade over time those grower

26
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,308
added mixes allows the grower to know

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,659
that fresh product has been added it

28
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,489
offers the opportunity for growers to

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,549
interests at specific issues if you're

30
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,169
looking at reducing damping off for

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,150
example you may want to add products

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,799
specifically for that purpose this

33
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,380
provides flexibility to change the mix

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,200
based on your application just two

35
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,030
examples here of you know some have

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,368
blend products where they're adding on

37
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,960
that only mycorrhizae products but

38
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,969
bacillus and trichoderma blends

39
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,069
all-in-one along with a couple nutrients

40
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,019
and that's common in both of these

41
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:38,008
products here it's important to look for

42
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:40,078
the propagation propagules program or CF

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,390
use colony forming units per gram when

44
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,089
you're looking at comparing the

45
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,439
microbial density of certain products

46
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,118
however this brings up a question of are

47
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,879
they worth it this can be a debated

48
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,109
topic and in controlled cases where many

49
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,000
other plant requirements are being

50
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,709
maximized such as light nutrients and

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,109
water the positive effects of these

52
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,759
microbes might be reduced as a result

53
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,129
increase in the cost may not be

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,390
justified so you're looking at typically

55
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,459
the cost of some of these products

56
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,649
versus the potential benefits if you're

57
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,370
maximizing light nutrients in water and

58
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,360
potentially carbon dioxide the

59
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,659
availability and the

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,850
benefits of these added microbes may not

61
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:21,030
be worth it will they do any harm

62
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,759
typically no but the cost may be cost

63
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,919
prohibitive in the sense that you might

64
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,719
be adding more cost to the situation and

65
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,889
not getting necessarily a return for

66
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,889
that in the end product
