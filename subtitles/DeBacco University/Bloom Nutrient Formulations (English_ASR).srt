1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
okay I've pictured here a couple of

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,119
bloom nutrient formulations these four

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,710
are just kind of a random assortment but

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,050
you'll notice that they all say the word

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,940
bloom on them typically what that means

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,548
is a high middle number which stands for

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:17,070
the phosphorus remember it's a nitrogen

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,710
phosphorus and potassium however this is

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,350
and that may be always the case if you

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,390
look at this one Walt does say bloom the

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,510
phosphorus is actually the same amount

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,920
as the potassium here so keep in mind

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,118
just because it says boom don't assume

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,130
it's always going to be a higher

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,600
phosphorous number I have to look more

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,079
specifically this is why you should be

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,700
reading all of the nutrient labels there

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,049
so flowering fertilizer is well bloom

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,429
fertilizers typically contain more

20
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,619
phosphorous to encourage and support

21
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,719
flowering however growers are often

22
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,939
excessively add phosphorus but can lead

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,129
to groundwater contamination so the

24
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:53,070
phosphorus and soils has a very complex

25
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:55,679
kind of system of components and inputs

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,960
and losses some can be runoff but if it

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,948
is over-applied this is where we get

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,259
into problems where there's usually

29
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:02,909
leaching this is usually minor because

30
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,890
it should be minor if you're adding the

31
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,228
proper amount however if you're over

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,109
adding you can contaminate not only

33
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:13,349
drinking water but local area freshwater

34
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,640
systems so an example of that by over

35
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,949
adding phosphorus can lead to algal

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,930
blooms in both a small scale so we see

37
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,299
here in a large scale this is a

38
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,368
satellite image this we're looking as

39
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,220
far away as the Great Lakes we can see

40
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,140
algal blooms particularly related to

41
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,688
excessive phosphorous added to that

42
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,040
water system now the paths of

43
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,228
phosphorous to farms and growers well

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,880
it's a lot of it's mined in Florida this

45
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,890
is you top it pictured here there are

46
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,899
some other areas that ship duty to the

47
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,728
Corn Belt as fertilizer it's applied to

48
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,829
corn and soybean fields on a large scale

49
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,688
the grain Canadian phosphorus can be

50
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:48,298
shipped to the Corn Belt then to Yukon

51
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,069
and the grain fed then to livestock and

52
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,649
the manure applied close to the barn

53
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,719
areas as a result the phosphorus that

54
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,129
was originally mine in Florida yes went

55
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,459
to the Corn Belt to help grow the corn

56
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,170
fed to the animals and then applied as

57
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,390
manure this means phosphorus from

58
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,399
Florida can accumulate in UConn's soils

59
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,349
the same thing that happened to

60
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,209
small-scale growers where it's mined in

61
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,878
Florida shipped as fertilizer and

62
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:14,459
applied and applied sadly and excessive

63
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:17,669
can lead to an accumulation in a

64
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,199
so why is this generally an issue and we

65
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:20,729
look at the world of phosphorus

66
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,378
fertilizer supplies we see the current

67
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,479
miss reserves a phosphate will be

68
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,848
exhausted around the year 2050 by

69
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,939
current estimates most of the phosphates

70
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:32,250
from Florida five countries control 87%

71
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,829
of the world phosphate reserves we see

72
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,900
the US only 7.8 percent with Morocco and

73
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,519
China being the vast majority world

74
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,980
reserves are estimated to last about 90

75
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,450
years so as a result Morocco and China

76
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,969
could be what's considered the OPEC of

77
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,818
phosphorus in the future this graph here

78
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:50,909
shows the US and the imports of rock

79
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:53,310
phosphate from 1900 to 2015 and you can

80
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,310
see for the vast majority of the early

81
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,709
going from about the mid 90s back we

82
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,370
exported a lot however now we're seeing

83
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,628
an increase in the amount of imports now

84
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,489
take care of today and you'll take care

85
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:07,169
of tomorrow we must be mindful of this

86
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,060
problem and manages nutrients in a

87
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,280
sustainable way we seem something that

88
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,109
can cause environmental damage and is

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,479
essentially running out is not good

90
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,609
stewardship we see the u.s. mine rock

91
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,828
phosphate now while it did increase we

92
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:21,750
see it dropping here this is not because

93
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,079
of reduction in use if we go back here

94
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,810
well the u.s. mine phosphate is going

95
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,180
down so in back remember we are starting

96
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,509
to import more so what's occurring is

97
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,359
we're mining less and we're importing

98
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:38,848
more and this is a particular nutrient

99
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:41,040
that is essential for plants but as they

100
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:42,568
said if we are over applying it that can

101
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,568
cause groundwater contamination which is

102
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:47,608
not good and we're now reliant more on

103
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:50,119
other countries for this vital nutrient

104
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,120
for plants
