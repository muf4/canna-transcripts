00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,480
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
here we're going to be looking at sexing

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
cannabis seedlings so you grow

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,800
plants from seeds that are diacious

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,320
where they could be male or female

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
how do you determine whether you have a

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
male plant or a female plant because a

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,199
lot of times i could determine if you're

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,118
looking for cannabinoids whether you

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,760
want to keep that plant or discard that

11
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:30,240
plant

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:31,519
so here follow along with this video

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,479
all right let's get into some of the

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,439
methods here so first off there are two

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,959
main options

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,878
one there's gender detection screening

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
using the pcr method or polymath

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,558
chain reaction method or there's the

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,039
quick cone clone and

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,718
flip method so both of these had

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
advantages and disadvantages

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,239
i'm going to cover both of these here

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,679
briefly giving you the pros and cons

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,198
and then you can make a decision on

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,878
which one you think is the best fit for

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,719
your growing environment

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,320
so first off using the gender detection

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,320
screening or pcr method

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
the advantage of this method is very

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,039
accurate it also offers very quick

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,558
results

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,478
and can be done early in plant

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,039
development so we're actually looking at

34
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,118
screening

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
some of the genetics of that plant

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,400
determine where it's male or female

37
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,920
and can be done basically at the very

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
early sealing stages

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
so again a lot of advantages with this

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,640
method the reason why everyone does not

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,159
use this method

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
is simply because of some of the key

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
disadvantages the first being of course

44
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,239
that it is costly

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,159
for the equipment to use to set up has

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,920
to be kind of a

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
lot of equipment that's needed a lot of

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
upfront cost associated with that

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
also requires individually testing each

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,478
plant material so organization and

51
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,000
labeling are also

52
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,679
very important and when i say

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
organization we're looking at at the

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,399
using these very small pcr tubes

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,920
to be able to analyze samples the

56
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,599
specialized equipment is needed or

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,719
material needs to be sent off to

58
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,519
site to a lab which again might be

59
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,560
prohibitive

60
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,158
for certain growing establishments so if

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,118
you look at the other method the clone

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,040
and flip method

63
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,560
the advance to this one and a big

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,118
advantage that's very easy

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
the results are clear and distinctive

66
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,840
female clones could be

67
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,758
providing an early indication of

68
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,520
chemical end products to be

69
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,239
produced what this simply involves is

70
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,080
taking vegetative cuttings from a plant

71
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,280
and putting them into a cloner typically

72
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
taking up a small space

73
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,640
and putting them under a flowering light

74
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
period so this can

75
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,079
induce flowering at a very early age and

76
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,759
that can determine

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
one whether you have a male or female

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,439
plant if it's a female you could keep it

79
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
going for a little bit longer and maybe

80
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,239
get some sort of idea of the chemical

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
end products

82
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
for that clone that it matches that

83
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,840
mother or stock plant that it matches

84
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,839
now are there also some disadvantage

85
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,039
with this method as it cannot be done

86
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,479
with autoflowers

87
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,400
and this does require labeling and a

88
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,479
dedicated space for 12 12

89
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,159
um hour 12 hours late for our start

90
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,560
photo period and it does take much

91
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,039
longer to get results than with the pcr

92
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,039
method so again each has its pros and

93
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,318
cons it's advanced and disadvantages

94
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,239
so you might want to review these and

95
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,560
then check out this channel for

96
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,200
continuing videos going into details

97
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,158
on whatever step or process you think is

98
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,839
the best fit

99
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,840
for your growing establishment
