1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
okay here we are fellas at heart and

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,000
anime being able to identify certain

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,889
sections of the heart and for this

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,530
lesson we're going to focus on the four

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,718
chambered heart so starting with the

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,449
heart location Rose we'll focus on the

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,679
human heart in particular as it's about

8
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,899
the size of your fist that's

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,000
proportional for everyone its location

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:24,149
is superior surface to the diaphragm

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,339
left of the midline anterior of the

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,198
vertebral column and prosti riyer of

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,170
this sternum so it is not located

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,179
perfectly in the center of your body it

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,579
is left to the midline and again is

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,769
termed superior anterior posterior left

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,090
of midline I'll come into play yet again

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,520
and as we see here now the mammalian or

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,289
a bird circulation all taken into this

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,210
four chambered heart so while we're

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,899
focusing on humans a lot of the same

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,660
would apply to mammals in birds one

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,160
pumps one portion of the heart pumps

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,919
blood to the lungs this is called the

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,519
pulmonary circuit so here pulmonary

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,769
arteries and the other portion of the

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,650
heart pumps blood to the rest of the

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,630
body called the systemic circuit these

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,719
two pumps operate together within a

30
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:15,390
single unit of the heart now vertebreak

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,728
heart are separated into two types of

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,739
chambers we have the atria we're seeing

33
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,200
our atrium as you see here our right to

34
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,319
atrium and left atrium they receive

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,118
blood from the body or the lungs and

36
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,429
contractions of the HSN blood through a

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,379
valve to the ventricles that's basically

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,079
taking the blood here is sending it to

39
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,548
the ventricles the ventricle portions

40
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,859
here they receive blood from the atria

41
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,320
and they contract us in blood to the

42
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,090
body or the lungs so those here the

43
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,359
muscles here for the ventricles are much

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,820
larger than that of the atria the atrium

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,310
up here this is because the ventricles

46
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,709
have descended to the all the way to the

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,649
lungs or even a greater distance to the

48
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,429
rest of the body that's why we see this

49
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,200
larger muscle here

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,740
the atrium is simply collecting the

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,600
blood and humming it to the ventricles

52
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:05,759
now human circulatory system invitees

53
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,399
quite complex a lot of arteries on the

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,899
veins going through here this diagram

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,459
kind of gives you an idea of the

56
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,979
percentage of blood and where it goes

57
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,989
well might be interesting if you look

58
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,949
three three the balloons okay and the

59
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:24,870
skin 6% 6% the liver is only receiving

60
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:26,759
6% directly to it but 27% is leading

61
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,349
that's because the liver has such a

62
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,969
strong connection to gastro GI system

63
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:33,509
gastrointestinal system and also the

64
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,209
spleen

65
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:38,159
so while 21% of the blood is going there

66
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,469
it's now leaving there it's being

67
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,479
diverted and going to the liver so liver

68
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:45,959
is very important for blood filtration

69
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,878
and as a result only at 6% directly

70
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,340
there is an additional 21 percent

71
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,699
indirectly through 27 percent goes back

72
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,890
to the veins and leaves the liver dual

73
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,709
pump operation is this just kind of

74
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,259
shows here the four chambered heart axes

75
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,239
two pumps one the atria contract forcing

76
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,739
blood to the ventricles then the

77
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,329
ventricles contract pushing blood

78
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,849
through the arteries to the lungs in the

79
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:11,250
body cycle ends in the heart relaxes and

80
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:13,439
then repeats again so we see that here's

81
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,878
our HGS setting it's the ventricles

82
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,859
ventricles are pumping and sending that

83
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,469
in this case this would be going to the

84
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:22,079
lungs in this cases be known to the rest

85
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:24,959
of the body we see our valves here

86
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,879
opening and closing allowing blood to be

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,590
controlled and pumped in efficient

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:35,039
manner keeping time the samuel atrial no

89
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,560
the SA node is nervous tissue that times

90
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,929
the heart beats we see it located here

91
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,989
the SA node causes the atria to contract

92
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,109
it sends a signal to the atrium with a

93
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,700
particular node which is also known as

94
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,000
the AV node and that's located right

95
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,459
here so there's a sense of a slight

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,430
delay which is a good thing because once

97
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,620
our atria contract that signals end

98
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,930
being sent to the AV node and similarly

99
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,180
the ventricles to contract if these both

100
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,409
contract with the exact same time blood

101
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,209
would have nowhere to go and everything

102
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:09,000
would just lock up so we need them the

103
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,870
blood to go from the atria here to get

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,579
to the ventricles

105
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,560
a slight delay before then it's sent out

106
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,430
to either the lungs or the rest of the

107
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,579
body systole pumping and diastole is

108
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,490
filling so we see our cistal's the

109
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,889
actual pumping and that filling

110
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,300
portion so this is the part of the

111
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,719
cardiac cycle during which the heart

112
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,660
refill

113
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,460
with blood after emptying done from the

114
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,880
assistant and the contraption this stage

115
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:38,579
there so we need a filling stage in a

116
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:41,009
slight delay so that blood can fill in

117
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,259
in this case to our ventricles before

118
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,839
being pumped out to either the lungs or

119
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,000
the rest of the body so the timing is

120
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,369
very important in the sense of what

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,319
contracts when and there needs to be a

122
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,449
slight delay to allow that blood to kind

123
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,159
of fill and accumulate and then seal

124
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,699
those valves up before it's pumped to

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,370
the next portion of the body part valves

126
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,349
kind of a interesting gist here and help

127
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,600
controls blood flow I should be able to

128
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,060
open completely to allow for efficient

129
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,670
blood flow also needs to close very

130
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,550
tightly we see some locations in names

131
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,830
of those particular valves tricuspid

132
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,129
valve is actually a three components to

133
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:20,550
it

134
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,339
pulmonary valve here the material valve

135
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,740
in the aortic valve here so each of them

136
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,539
is labeled differently and that's going

137
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,090
to help us we start tracking blood

138
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,250
flowing through the heart we see them

139
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,168
opening and closing here and how much

140
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,120
that heart does kind of move here's our

141
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,859
age you can tract enough that you can

142
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,240
dose our valves here opening and then

143
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,009
closing tight and these valves are

144
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,199
opening aligned good to come in force

145
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,610
its way through here it's very important

146
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,509
that all these valves open and close

147
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,949
efficiently total out blood to move now

148
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,228
the heart sounds there's kind of a love

149
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,569
dub and that's occurring due to the

150
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:58,139
opening and closing valves and the

151
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:59,759
pressure that's being built up there so

152
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,649
what gives the heart its sound is that

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,740
simple opening slamming close of the

154
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:06,899
valves as hard that muscle is constantly

155
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,439
moving and forcing blood to different

156
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:12,629
regions lastly our heart murmur easiest

157
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,620
method for diagnosis is to listen to it

158
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,990
with us Etha scope here if valves are

159
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,519
not fully open or closing turbulence

160
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,740
gets created and this is what's called

161
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,319
the heart murmur typically Sedan a

162
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,418
newborns and young individuals here

163
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,389
bridges listen to the heart we're trying

164
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,949
to having that distinct love dub is not

165
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,599
there's that murmur and that's cousin of

166
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,339
turbulence and that could indicate there

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,590
might be a problem with one of the

168
