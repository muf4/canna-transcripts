1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,178
okay here we're briefly cover some of

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,269
the water pumps and explain a little bit

3
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:09,089
about them submersible in-line in some

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:10,678
pumps now we're going to avoid the hand

5
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:13,468
pump here so if you're using one of

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,820
these odds are probably not able to take

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,278
advantage of some of the common

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,640
irrigation systems all of these here run

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:23,910
on some form of power rather than just

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,339
manual power here so first off we gotta

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,410
start with some terms two key ones that

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,759
you may see pumps displayed in many

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,500
different types of pumps out there the

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,940
standard classifications are they will

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,939
tell you how many gallons per minute GPM

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,349
or gallons per hour it'll give you that

17
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,539
quote so you have an idea of the flow

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,670
rate also you might see something called

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,920
head height that's the maximum pumping

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,670
height or called the zero flow point

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,429
that means is how high or how many feet

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,590
can that pump pump that water before

23
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,509
it's unable to actually cause a flow

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,829
rate now to be the head height there

25
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,509
this could be important if you're

26
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,210
mounting a pump very low and you're

27
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,519
putting the in the bottom of a big

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,260
irrigation tank you got to pump it out

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,609
of the tank and up to another area if

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,549
you're going uphill for a larger

31
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:11,670
operation so just keep that in mind of

32
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,530
what head height is now an inline pump

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,930
typically placed outside the water

34
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,549
reservoir they're more powerful than

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,409
these submersible pumps I'll talk about

36
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,850
in a second they do tend to require air

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,159
cooling and they're commonly found in

38
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:24,719
large-scale operations when oversize

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,509
these pumps due to restrictions in the

40
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,798
system so I've used these it can be

41
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,319
quite powerful it can be a little noisy

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,820
at times they are air-cooled and

43
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,949
sometimes they do need priming to keep

44
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,959
that in mind there so they're a little

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,430
bit better for larger operations are

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,219
moving a little higher volume of water

47
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,549
in most cases then there's some merciful

48
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,048
pumps these sit directly in the water

49
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,549
reserves that you have the advantages

50
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,890
these pumps are water-cooled if you keep

51
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,479
them that water at a good temperature it

52
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,519
can help cool the pump so you don't burn

53
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,810
it out if you are running it for an

54
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,968
extended period of time that will be

55
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,409
circulating that water in particular you

56
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,539
can heat the water up with this type of

57
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,549
pump so keep that also in mind of the

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,899
pros and cons the advantage is one of

59
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,790
those plumbing is mixing the nutrient

60
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,769
solution typically you some smaller

61
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,479
operations do the overall lack of power

62
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,430
found in this classification of pumps

63
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,900
despite stated values you want to figure

64
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,560
out what you need and then purchase a

65
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,770
pump that's about

66
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,780
double the volume that you need simply

67
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,640
because of the lack of efficiencies

68
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,568
tends to be with them so their stated

69
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,089
values tend to be a little bit

70
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,259
overstating I feel those values you want

71
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,819
to watch the head height so you want to

72
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,039
don't want to have these pump a great

73
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,139
distance up because they can be a little

74
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,789
bit weaker most of time in that regards

75
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:34,229
but just keep note of it or look for

76
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,179
that on the pump you looking at

77
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:39,060
purchasing I use this one here and a

78
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,920
flood in train operation the last one

79
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,739
the sub pump these are commonly used to

80
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,329
transfer and mixing also pump out a

81
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,069
basement that tends to flood so that's

82
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,630
really may be familiar with these they

83
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,120
can be classified as kind of this

84
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,979
special classification of submersible

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,420
pumps it can they come a little bit

86
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,849
larger sizes they can be measured in

87
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,129
horsepower but commonly is for transfer

88
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,259
or mixing a little bit on the larger end

89
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:03,870
of things they can have this kind of

90
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,449
automatic shutoff so this is just kind

91
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,039
of a specialized version of this we

92
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,530
talked about previously our submersible

93
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,329
pumps they need to be submersed in that

94
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,650
water to help pump it so if you're

95
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,660
looking the bigger operation this could

96
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,159
be some things you consider well that

97
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,859
gives you just that brief overview of

98
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,699
pumps to consider for your irrigation

99
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,700
options
