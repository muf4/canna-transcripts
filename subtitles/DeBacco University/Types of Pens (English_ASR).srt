1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,040
you may have your favorite type of pen

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,240
but here we're going to look at some of

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,679
the basic different types of

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,519
construction

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,239
of different pens such as ballpoint

6
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,119
fountain felt and ceramic to name a few

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,919
so starting with the ballpoint pen

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,239
dispenses

9
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,759
oil-based ink and internal reservoir

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,038
through the rolling action of a metal

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,320
ball and that's where it gets its name

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
from we can see kind of zoomed in

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,439
versions here

14
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,759
that small little rolls and that causes

15
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,960
the ink the ball may be made of brass

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,480
steel or tungsten carbonite the diameter

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,520
it can be classified as

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,000
fine medium or needle point often is the

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000
case

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,280
it's referring to the precision of that

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
ball there uh

22
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
for a ballpoint pen they're typically

23
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
not made in china

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
due to the need to have very strict

25
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,399
tolerances to the components

26
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,919
which china tends not to have that high

27
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,239
degree of tolerance

28
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,000
so this is why these tend not not to be

29
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,238
made in china

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,439
then we have our roller pens and these

31
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,359
are similar

32
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,119
mechanics to a ballpoint pen but they

33
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,280
use water-based liquid or gelled

34
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,718
ink as opposed to the oil-based

35
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,879
viscosities ink found

36
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,640
in ballpoint pens they're less viscous

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
ink and tend to saturate more deeply

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
and more widely into paper than other

39
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,519
types of ink

40
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
and the writing point is a tiny ball

41
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,519
usually 0.5 or 0.7

42
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
millimeters in diameter that transfers

43
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,759
the ink from the reservoir to the paper

44
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
as the pen moves as it rolls across the

45
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
surface

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
then we have gel pens this ink pigment

47
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,159
is suspended in a water-based gel

48
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,960
the ink is thick and opaque so it's

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
something that kind of

50
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,879
differentially differentiates it from

51
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,479
the others some people really like it

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,158
and some people don't like it

53
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,239
shows it more clearly on darker slick

54
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,359
surfaces than typical inks used for the

55
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,158
ballpoint or even

56
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,759
felt tipped pens those gel pens are

57
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
popular as increased leading to them

58
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,959
being

59
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,719
used to sign many legal documents so it

60
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,279
is important to kind of be advised for

61
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,959
what they

62
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,799
look like and what characteristics they

63
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,639
may have because we may be seeing them

64
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,840
more often this is increased number of

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,000
suspected and fraud cases so again

66
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
definitely a worthy note not just a gel

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,280
pen is no longer just kind of a

68
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,519
fun pen that a couple people use it's

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
being used at higher levels as well

70
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,680
several well-established methods exist

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
for analyzing inks from ball point and

72
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,800
fountain pens

73
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,919
but not note so much for the gel pens

74
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
which is

75
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,399
important when we're looking at them

76
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,560
being used in a potential crime scene

77
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,159
we have our fountain pens this is a

78
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
nimble pen that contains an internal

79
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,959
reservoir of water-based liquid

80
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,520
uh unlike the predecessors at the dip

81
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,439
pen

82
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
this pen draws ink from the reservoir

83
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,519
through the feed

84
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,199
to the nib that deposits on the paper

85
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,840
via combination of gravity

86
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,039
and capillary action so no longer you

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
have the

88
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,159
feather you have to dip into the

89
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,318
fountain this has an internal

90
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,840
kind of reservoir there but kind of a

91
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,318
unique mechanical

92
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
system for delivering that ink we have

93
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,598
our felt tip pen just as the name

94
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,800
implies

95
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,679
it has a tip that is felt based and we

96
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
kind of see that here

97
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
it's a really zoomed in version of some

98
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,878
of the fibers coming out

99
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,878
this tip is common very porous and

100
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,878
pressed on fibers such as felt

101
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,560
these into the early 90s was the most

102
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,518
common solvents were used in the ink

103
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,959
were

104
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,039
tiling or xylene today the ink's usually

105
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
made of bases of alcohols propanol

106
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,919
butanol and things like that so

107
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
important if you're looking at analyzing

108
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,559
the ink

109
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,479
to be looking at more alcohol based if

110
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,598
you think it was originated from

111
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,679
a felt tipped pen and lastly we have

112
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,518
ceramic pens and these wear

113
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
well due to ceramic materials a very

114
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,920
hard very

115
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,760
dense material and does not broaden when

116
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,039
pressure is applied while writing

117
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,199
it's important when you're looking at

118
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,318
analyzing the handwriting if it was made

119
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,598
from a ceramic

120
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,598
tip pen
