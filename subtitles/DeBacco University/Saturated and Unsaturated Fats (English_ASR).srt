1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay here we're going to be looking at

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,020
saturated in unsaturated fats as we see

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,859
from the initial picture here saturated

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:12,329
has very little linear organization and

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,609
unsaturated fats here have a presence of

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,009
a double bond creating this a little bit

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,089
more of a jagged appearance here so

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,740
we'll look at this more in a little bit

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,910
of a molecular scale this gives you this

10
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,518
is that quick comparison of the

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,759
saturated versus an unsaturated fat that

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,108
contains at least one double bond so

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,340
fatty acids can be saturated or

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,949
unsaturated there's our two main

15
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,019
classifications for saturated fats which

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,380
are mostly animal fats there's single

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,809
bonds between all carbon atoms so if one

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,700
way to remember saturated fats think of

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,679
it saturated with hydrogen's because

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,960
there's all single bonds here so there's

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,509
the maximum amount of hydrogen's located

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,090
on this molecule unsaturated fats are

23
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:54,359
typically oils we've mostly plant fats

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,210
may contain one or more double bond

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,429
between carbon atoms we see this line

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,280
here indicating a double bond this

27
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,948
double bond as compared to our saturated

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,500
fats women will be less total hydrogen's

29
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,060
here compared to saturated so

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,459
unsaturated fats have less total

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,379
hydrogens and have this double bond this

32
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,109
double bond causes a fixed point and

33
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:20,039
this can cause a change in the overall

34
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,118
shape of our fatty acid and I think this

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,790
picture kind of shows a nice

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,049
representation of that in saturated fats

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,700
you see saturated with hydrogen's

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,460
because it's all single bonds

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,829
however unsaturated fats only need one

40
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,559
double bond and that double bond can be

41
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:36,750
an assists orientation where we see both

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,090
hydrogens are located on the same side

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,400
and we have a trans orientation where

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,070
they're located on opposite sides here

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,600
so that double bond fixes those two

46
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,728
carbons and they're bonded together and

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,009
as a result we can have a cyst form but

48
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:52,228
they're both on the same side or we can

49
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,649
have a transform when we have one that

50
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,500
is below the other one there so keep in

51
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,180
mind saturates all look the same

52
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,769
unsaturated only needs one double bond

53
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,149
and that could be an ASIS or transform

54
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:08,340
those saturated fats are typically

55
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,530
solidifying they're cool cool they can

56
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,409
raise our cholesterol they're very

57
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,080
stable our unsaturated fats are

58
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,219
considered to be more of our good fats

59
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,219
they don't raise your cholesterol that

60
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,930
little unstable and they do not salute

61
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,800
asylum cool this is why these typically

62
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,810
are oils they're good fats the saturated

63
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,380
ones butters and things we may like the

64
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,680
ice creams tea cakes is are saturated

65
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,909
with hydrogen's and these are typically

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,180
have negative effects in the body where

67
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,669
we're raising our cholesterol that

68
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,439
saturated and unsaturated again here's

69
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,479
how our chains look highlighted the

70
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,699
unsaturated double bond here and the sis

71
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,979
form but this gives you an idea from

72
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,780
that first image of how our saturated

73
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,479
fats looks like a very nice tight line

74
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,009
and unsaturated fats had at least one

75
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,629
double bond in this case there's two

76
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,679
inside a little bit more of a notched

77
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:05,280
appearance located here comparing of fat

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,590
composition so oils they said have less

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,379
of those saturated fats and a greater

80
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,990
portion of those mono unsaturated

81
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:16,590
to one double bond or polyunsaturated

82
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,629
between multiple double bonds form their

83
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,539
dairy products could see a much higher

84
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:24,509
portion of saturated fats and little to

85
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,709
almost none of polyunsaturated fats and

86
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:27,209
there's some other meat products here

87
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,670
just to give you that kind of general

88
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:33,750
comparison look at some other

89
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:35,879
classifications here we have our nuts

90
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,669
sweetened baked goods and you can see

91
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,849
just on a quick comparison the change in

92
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:44,280
the amount of polyunsaturated fats and

93
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:46,259
same here butter very high percentage of

94
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,599
saturated fat so again just a good

95
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:52,229
comparison and a good resource to look

96
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,689
at and compare this is the cicero's

97
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,849
transforms cysteine on the same side

98
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:59,310
with that double bond trans being on

99
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,129
opposite sides here we get to see how

100
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,650
different those molecules look now

101
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:08,159
importantly remember these because trans

102
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,390
fats do not occur in nature so fats that

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,489
look like this where our hydrogens are

104
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:15,238
on opposite sides believe that do not

105
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:18,569
occur in nature we see a evidence here

106
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,980
of that trans fat so what they do exist

107
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,168
but they don't occur in nature

108
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,110
well they occur typically when we

109
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:26,279
process foods

110
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,300
so the cyst ruptures in your body is

111
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,059
able to process and

112
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,650
it's all structure right here trans are

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,168
not helpful for the body and linked to

114
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:36,089
cancer and heart disease so it's very

115
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:38,180
important of the structure of these

116
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,709
molecules and how it impacts our body

117
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,310
artificial trans fats are created in an

118
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:46,228
industrial process that adds hydrogen to

119
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,829
liquid vegetable oils making them more

120
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:52,199
solid so there's a advantage here in the

121
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:54,418
processing industry which is why some of

122
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,490
these have been created the primary

123
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,378
dietary source for trans fats is

124
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,860
processed foods and it's partially

125
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,569
hydrogenated oils as a result and now

126
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,639
we're seeing the negatives and linking

127
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,620
these negative effects to these trans

128
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,620
fats we're not seeing them required to

129
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,478
be on Nutrition Facts labels so foods

130
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,340
are required to state trans fat on the

131
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,649
label so take a look and know what

132
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,508
you're eating as a result of this

133
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,120
companies are now going about different

134
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:23,280
ways to achieve the same end result

135
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,598
without creating trans fats because of

136
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,359
their negative impacts in the body

137
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:29,668
however now with the label laws having

138
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,740
chemists required to state this you can

139
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:35,750
easily check to see if there's any trans

140
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,750
fats in the food you are consuming
