00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,960
looking at the importance of keeping

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,278
records

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,199
as a cannabis grower and while this may

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,320
not be the most entertaining or

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,399
flashiest of videos

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
this is a very important one that a lot

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
of growers will often

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,240
overlook and only realize at the end of

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,639
a grow or looking back that they wish

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,559
they

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,920
put a little bit more time into this so

13
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,919
hopefully this video will prevent you

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,679
from making that mistake

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,160
so first off i said often missed by

16
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,879
growers the floors are not sure why this

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,439
seems to be

18
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,359
a consistent problem but more often than

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,119
not growers do not document what they do

20
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,039
or keep records in general

21
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,399
now we're looking at record keeping it

22
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,320
could be very simple

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,920
or it could be very complex it doesn't

24
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,439
really matter in the sense that

25
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
you're getting in the pattern of taking

26
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,519
at least some sort of records

27
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,799
and that could be simply when you water

28
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,000
how much you water

29
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,000
when you're fertilizing what you're

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
fertilizing with some sort of calendar

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
system

32
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,280
just some way to be able to look back at

33
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,320
what you did to the plants

34
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
so this is applicable to all growers

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
while there can be different levels of

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,118
record keeping depending on growing

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,719
situation specifics

38
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,959
all growers must have some method for

39
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,640
documentation and this is true if you're

40
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,519
an indoor grower mainly growing one or

41
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,680
two plants

42
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,438
if you're an indigra growing a large

43
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
number hundreds or thousands of plants

44
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,719
or even if you're an outdoor grower all

45
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,798
of these

46
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,079
growers this applies to so a lot of

47
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,520
people think i'm growing one or two

48
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,519
plants doesn't really matter

49
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,560
i definitely want to be documenting and

50
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,519
keeping track

51
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
of what you're doing so the reason why

52
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,519
you want to do this is the data is

53
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
really

54
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,679
key to overall success because knowing

55
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,559
what you did is important for refining a

56
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
growing plan

57
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
or to identify what may have gone wrong

58
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
with a growth cycle

59
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
it also works if something went right

60
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
you have a good track record of what you

61
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,000
did to try to

62
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
repeat that same success maybe even

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,118
refine your tactics even a little bit

64
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,039
more

65
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:54,078
so again data is key to success in

66
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,759
documenting that data is also important

67
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:56,798
so a lot of growers ask well what should

68
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
i be documenting what should i be

69
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,520
looking

70
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
at these are just some basic suggestions

71
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,478
for example

72
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,519
the basics of your growing area the size

73
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:04,879
of your growing area the number of

74
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,438
plants the type of plants starting

75
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,280
materials

76
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,719
seeds or clones feminized seeds

77
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
temperature and humidity levels

78
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,719
as well as the materials you're using

79
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,919
what media containers ventilation lights

80
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,759
are using there's a whole plethora of

81
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,199
more you could add to that key dates

82
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,560
such as when you start or flowering

83
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,439
dates or harvest dates those are like

84
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,439
the key main

85
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,359
three there with cannabis production

86
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,520
water usage the frequency and amount

87
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
of related to plant age fertilizers

88
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,840
added and the mixed ratios that you need

89
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,759
to

90
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
apply them what fertilizer and what

91
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,639
dilution rate did you do you may be

92
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,879
changing that over

93
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,679
the grow cycle and then also pest

94
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,919
pressures

95
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
what uh when and what was seen and

96
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,639
documented and how did you potentially

97
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,280
go about trying to control that

98
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,639
and how effective was that for those

99
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
that are breeding

100
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,839
an extra level of detail needs to be

101
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,040
included looking for at morphological

102
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
and plant specifics

103
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,159
it's important for tracking traits from

104
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,919
one generation to the next

105
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,598
is it more of a broadly squattier

106
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,679
appearance with short internodes or is

107
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,158
it more of a taller growing plant

108
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,519
with more thinner leaves these are all

109
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,239
important considerations

110
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,719
to be documenting so again regardless of

111
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,800
what's

112
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,239
grower you are what level you're at

113
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,239
everyone should be taking

114
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,158
and collecting data with their grow so

115
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,280
they can continue to improve their

116
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,519
ability

117
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,519
as growers of cannabis in general
