00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,609
welcome to biology with me mr. tobacco

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,460
you might be wondering what you got

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,259
yourself into here on day one with the

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,139
way that I structure my class and just

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:17,339
dealing with the enormity of biology and

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:20,399
the wide variety of topics that this one

7
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,839
subject area covers now for me in my

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,268
class I structure a little bit

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,429
differently than you may be used to so

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:29,428
I'm starting off with outside of class

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,018
the content is provided in slides that

12
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,528
you have access to just like this one

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:33,449
here

14
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,850
these are publicly available and

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,770
typically on YouTube and this allows

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,289
access for a wide variety of locations

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,960
and also for you to utilize as a

18
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,259
resource parents and anyone worldwide

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,969
can view the material and comment on it

20
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:50,399
so it is designed to be just more than

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,260
just for this class but upon graduating

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,670
from this class you can use it as a

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:58,948
resource to refer back to now outside of

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,198
class rather than take valuable class

25
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:03,179
time to go over the slides there's going

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,798
to be these video lectures posted for

27
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,719
you to view this is going to be your

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,939
main homework for this course which is

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,810
simply to watch the videos so my piece

30
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,029
up a little different than you're used

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,189
to then kind of just going through and

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,900
answering a bunch of questions mainly to

33
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:17,309
watch these videos and to take notes on

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,500
these videos is your main source

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,719
homework this gives you the option to

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,180
watch them at anytime day or night and

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,819
review them and pause them and take

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,140
notes at your own pace you can go

39
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,578
through them and you can watch them at

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,250
speed great if you need to pause them

41
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,228
and go back go grab a snack all this is

42
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,219
allows you the freedom to view the

43
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:40,799
material at your own pace now I will

44
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,019
assign a certain number of videos for

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
homework to watch and keep in mind that

46
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,769
random video pop quizzes are fair game

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,599
at any point for the videos you're

48
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,759
expected to have washed up to that day

49
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,859
the pop quizzes are short and they're

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,810
intend to be like an eye test kind of

51
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,090
easy and quick either know it or you

52
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,920
don't know it move on at the beginning

53
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,380
of class those your time to ask specific

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,629
questions on material if you do have any

55
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:07,459
before we proceed to the next step

56
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:09,228
now during class we're going to build on

57
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,359
the basic information that you gain in

58
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,040
the video we utilize lab activities

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,690
problem based questions so that you're

60
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,030
able to work with the material instead

61
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:18,800
of simply memorizing information so a

62
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,419
lot of students I find really want to do

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,950
there will likely be times of

64
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:24,799
frustration you might feel like this at

65
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:27,259
times or like this and this is okay this

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,540
is part of the learning process it's not

67
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:31,969
meant to be super easy quick just vocab

68
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:33,859
memorized no need to be able to process

69
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:35,300
the information and I find for a lot of

70
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,930
students that may lead to time to

71
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,180
frustration I don't want you just to

72
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,790
memorize material but go is the goal is

73
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,930
to get away from just that simple

74
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,239
regurgitation memorizing the material

75
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,909
you need to be able to understand the

76
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,039
material and also be able to apply the

77
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:53,750
material multimethods students are going

78
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,280
to memorizing but cannot work with the

79
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,919
material I want to get into this kind of

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,689
memory card situation I mean when I have

81
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,789
the picture of the squirrel here he had

82
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,280
to figure out how to get up the tree

83
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:06,409
climb down the little string here to get

84
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,759
at the bird Peter where the food is then

85
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:09,379
just memorize something you had to work

86
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,539
with and understanding and applying the

87
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,769
situation he was given it's a division

88
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,019
you might be more familiar with could be

89
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,870
a flat tire in a car how are you gonna

90
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,759
go about understanding them and solving

91
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,569
this problem what tools you're gonna

92
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,639
grab where those tools located I mean to

93
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:27,649
change your study habits so this course

94
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,988
will be an adjustment for many students

95
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,700
I find the pace is very fast and the

96
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,189
content is rich there's a lot of stuff

97
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,869
that we cover here a similar unit can

98
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:38,000
have over a hundred slides it'll only

99
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,400
take about five to eight school days to

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,068
cover you can that cram study the night

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,260
before the key is to pace yourself and

102
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:47,629
they do a little each night so that

103
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:49,669
you're able to understand the material

104
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,900
and build upon that material rather than

105
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:54,530
just try to memorize it all the night

106
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,599
before now the positive end at the end

107
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,879
of the year I've gotten some student

108
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,099
comments these are actual student quotes

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,629
that I've received so during the year

110
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,549
our law students complain as I'm sure

111
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,659
you probably will however looking back

112
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,609
some students realized the bigger

113
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,068
picture they've said thank you for

114
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,389
teaching us to think on our own or I was

115
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:12,889
able to understand the difference

116
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,349
between surface learning and digging

117
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,598
deep and probably the situation you're

118
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:18,159
in right now is at the beginning of the

119
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:20,319
year we were

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,270
afraid to have you as a teacher because

121
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,310
we heard of how difficult you were but

122
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:26,949
slowly we came to recognize that the

123
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,649
reason you pushed us was for our benefit

124
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,479
so hopefully throughout this course

125
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:34,120
you'll feel challenged at times but in

126
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,030
the end you'll develop a deeper

127
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,000
understanding of biology and improve

128
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:42,309
your study habits overall hopefully

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,550
we'll have a good year together in

130
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,550
biology
