1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,958
and this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,359
going to go over whether we should be

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,638
using land race or heirlooms when we're

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,859
describing cannabis so a lot of times

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,899
from Cannabis land race is used and for

6
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,518
tomatoes heirlooms is used but what

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,618
should be using for camps what's the

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,060
correct term to be using we'll answer

9
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,059
that here in this video

10
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:28,079
[Music]

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,419
all right so properly naming plants

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,159
we're looking at land race land races of

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,020
crops are most closely aligned with

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,299
heirlooms being that they are naturally

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,160
occurring they are indigenous to certain

16
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,839
regions and developed their

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,119
characteristics in response to the

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,579
growing conditions of that area land

19
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,058
race plant species are relatively rare

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,820
because many have been supplemented to

21
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,039
breed crops and have died out due to the

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,659
changing climate and also through human

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,039
intervention

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,078
countries where I look at properly

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,579
naming heirlooms this had typically done

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,799
with are thought of to be done with

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,840
tomatoes heirlooms are open pollinated

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,359
plants that have been passed down from

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,420
generation to generation they are living

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,340
artifacts and living history exhibits

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,960
and they're considered a reservoir for

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,640
genetic diversity

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,679
because they're open pollinated these

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,719
cultivars mean that the plants grown

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,580
from seed will be true to type and will

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,319
resemble the plant from which it comes

37
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,060
from some plants however can

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,579
cross-pollinate and therefore careful

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,640
practices must prevent cross-pollination

40
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,319
to maintain those particular varieties

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,840
that's a breakdown between what a true

42
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,000
land race is and what the definition of

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,859
an heirloom is now looking at the ear

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,959
room classification

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,180
so there are some confusion as to how

46
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,699
old a variety must be to be classified

47
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,340
truly as an air room some believe that

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,020
any variety grown before 1951 when the

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,118
first hybrids became available is an

50
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,359
heirloom however many heirlooms are 100

51
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,000
to 150 years old or even much older than

52
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,200
this in regards to vegetables seed

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,599
saving gardeners have kept their

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,780
heirloom fries alive

55
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,519
as has the Seed Savers exchange in Iowa

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,859
there they're kind of reserving those

57
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,519
seeds and kind of keeping that preserved

58
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,739
for genetic use potentially in the

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,379
future as a reservoir

60
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,120
so how do we go about naming a hybrid as

61
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,560
you know just another idea we heard land

62
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,659
race air rooms what about hybrids I

63
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,000
often get asked a hybrid is a result of

64
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,439
pollinating one specific variety of a

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,840
class of plants with the pollen of

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,060
another genetically different variety of

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,759
that same class while the hybrid can

68
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,098
occur by chance within the seed industry

69
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,199
hybrids are result of cross-breeding of

70
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,119
carefully chosen parent plants that

71
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,919
produce Offspring or seeds that will

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,599
have special characteristics or

73
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,479
volunteer necks that go behind this in a

74
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,238
lot of looking at kind of different

75
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,340
family trees and kind of looking at what

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,378
the goal is to ultimately develop in a

77
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,180
plant by controlling the pollination

78
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,159
process this results in The Offspring

79
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,500
having genetic characteristics from both

80
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,598
parents The Offspring or seeds of this

81
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,719
cross is called an F1 hybrid and F1

82
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,759
stands for first finale the seeds from

83
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,979
this crust will produce plants that are

84
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,479
very uniform in plant habit and carry a

85
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,000
combination of traits from both parent

86
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,079
plants and hopefully those both traits

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,539
that are carried over are both

88
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,340
considered to be advantageous in that

89
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,439
resulting offspring

90
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,000
so landless versus heirlooms looking

91
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,699
that's kind of the direct comparison

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,318
here land races are wild cannabis

93
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,179
strains that grow throughout the world

94
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:28,378
free of contact with humans so they

95
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,780
retain their genetics and

96
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:32,419
characteristics specific for that

97
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,098
environment in which they're growing in

98
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,479
heirlooms are land race is grown in a

99
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,639
non-native environment that's a key

100
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,738
character distinguishing characteristic

101
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,359
there heirloom strains have not been

102
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,000
genetically crossed or pollinated in a

103
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,159
specific way but have been brought from

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,919
their place of origin and cultivated by

105
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,419
humans in a new environment so this

106
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,039
implant grown out here in the wild would

107
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,780
be considered a land race we move that

108
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,639
to a different growing location extreme

109
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,959
though in an indoor environment that

110
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,119
would then classify that then

111
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,920
technically as an heirloom

112
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,860
so why does heirloom need to be used

113
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,780
more particularly in regards to cannabis

114
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,879
production if you're growing a plant

115
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,699
outside of the postulated domestic area

116
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,759
you are growing in heirloom or hybrid

117
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,738
and not a land race it's only a land

118
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,139
race if it's being grown in its native

119
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,698
Geographic environment so if you're

120
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,579
moving that plant from wherever it was

121
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,660
naturally grown to any other location

122
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:26,399
you're really not growing in land race

123
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,139
you're technically growing an heirloom

124
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,839
again it's why that needs to be used a

125
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,699
little bit more kind of defined by

126
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,839
Growers the Cannabis industry in

127
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,180
particular

128
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,339
so the land race seed uh kind of

129
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,500
misconception while Growers want to have

130
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,079
the original land race variety if you're

131
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,180
growing it out of the native area then

132
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,339
you're growing an heirloom land race

133
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,759
requires both the seed or the Clone or

134
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,899
plant material and location

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,520
heirlooms just need the seed or the

136
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,099
Clone replacement material so you see

137
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,139
the best land-raised seeds in land race

138
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,759
cannabis strains of Asia well you're

139
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,319
taking them out of Asia or even out of

140
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
the area within Asia that they're being

141
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,978
grown well we need to be using the term

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
heirloom which I know is going to be a

143
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:08,839
change for a lot of people but that's

144
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,000
the true scientific

145
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,619
reasoning for that change and I know

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,899
it's a hard concept to get across but

147
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,340
here at tobacco University the goal here

148
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,859
is to provide you with the true

149
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,839
scientific answer even though it may not

150
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,919
be what's popular or currently accepted

151
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,918
in the industry
