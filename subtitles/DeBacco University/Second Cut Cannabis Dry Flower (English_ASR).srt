1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,780
maybe you've seen second cut cannabis

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,699
dry flour for sale and wondered what

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,919
that was will this tobacco University

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,919
video will cover just that

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,579
[Music]

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,380
all right let's get into second cut

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,778
cannabis dry flour and get some

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,000
information about this well first off I

9
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,559
want to thank CT Pharma here because

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,839
they provide publicly available

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,939
analytical reports and labels on

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,559
products they produce the descriptions

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,820
are intended to provide an understanding

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,019
of some of the end products of the

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,679
cannabis plant and we're going to look

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,440
at here at second cut and the analytical

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,539
reports are great to look at to make

18
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,878
sure if you're looking at purchasing or

19
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,200
considering second flower what you

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,058
should be looking for

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,520
so getting into the description of

22
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,378
exactly what second flower is well it's

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,300
smaller kind of nickel sized buds

24
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,339
usually leafier and less dense than the

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,140
premium flower it delivers all the same

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,000
effects as a premium flower in the sense

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,039
that it has the same terpenes and the

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,140
same cannabinoids however second cut is

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,118
separated from premium flower although

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,859
the use of a screen system that filters

31
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,438
out the smaller buds from the premium

32
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,579
basically those smaller less than spuds

33
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,739
but because you're coming from the same

34
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,179
plant they should have the same basic

35
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,798
profile

36
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,220
now what are the options we're looking

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,618
at second cut well some cultivars as as

38
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,179
premium flour that's often looked at as

39
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,159
an affordable way to experience

40
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,720
different cultivars as much more

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,780
inexpensive than those of the premium

42
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,099
version so it's great if you wanted to

43
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,320
consider trying a new variety of new

44
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,438
cultivar second cup might be the option

45
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,239
simply because it's less expensive and

46
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,978
depends on the dispensary the cultivar

47
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,618
and the potency again will determine the

48
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:46,019
price but compared to premium flour it

49
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,399
will likely be less expensive of the

50
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,438
same cultivar

51
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,359
what are the uses for a second flower

52
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,758
well second flower is favored by

53
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,438
consumers for its easy accessibility the

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,478
smaller buds can easily be broken up at

55
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,459
home for rolling and vaporizing can also

56
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,679
be used in all the same devices as

57
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,959
premium flowers used in just remember it

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,060
will be kind of that less dense and

59
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,519
smaller size

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,219
here's an example of a certificate of

61
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,140
analysis and again while most consumers

62
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,598
focus on the terpenes and cannabinoids

63
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:17,279
keep in mind that that first page is

64
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,859
almost more important in the sense it

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,719
gives a microbial heavy metal mycotoxin

66
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,300
and pesticide analysis and you want to

67
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,159
see a pass for all of these and what

68
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,260
you're right as a consumer to be asking

69
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,359
for this type of paperwork associated

70
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,280
with anything that you're purchasing now

71
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,599
while it is good to kind of the label

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,818
will kind of summarize things it says

73
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,799
pass for all and this does present a lot

74
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,539
of the information very cleanly and

75
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,879
that's a great thing it's some include

76
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,219
the little QR code here for checking but

77
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,139
it's also good to inquire about the

78
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,120
actual paperwork or the information was

79
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,639
derived from you're checking the names

80
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,439
you're checking the dates just a way for

81
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,439
you to be an informed consumer
