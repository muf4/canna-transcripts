00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,759
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,480
going to go over how

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,679
to identify and control powdery mildew

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:16,030
as we see exhibited

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:19,278
in this picture right here in cannabis

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,720
[Music]

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,800
all right let's go over how to identify

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,399
and control powdery mildew on cannabis

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
if you're getting it to this stage

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,839
probably a little late so hopefully you

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
can identify earlier than this

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,439
and implement some of the suggested

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,399
controls here so you don't get to this

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
level of severity so how do we go about

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,200
identifying

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,559
powdery mildew well it's a white powdery

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
substance that is typically first

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,718
noticed on the leaves but can infect the

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,280
buds as well as sometimes even the stems

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
hempery mildew as caused by what looks

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,000
like now is

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,239
two potential of fungi and is identified

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,238
by its upright chains and barrel shaped

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,718
spores when you're able to zoom in

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,878
at high magnification they can tend to

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
favor one side either the top or the

27
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,000
bottom of the leaf

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
during early establishment so be sure to

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,719
scout both

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,158
sometimes i find it much more on the

31
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
upper surface of the leaves and the

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
under surface is left untouched

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,519
other times in other plans sometimes it

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,520
starts on the underside

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,200
first so again be sure to check both

36
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,438
sides of the leaf

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,680
also check shadier locations typically

38
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,279
the interior portions of the plant

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,960
those leaves as this is where it

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,560
typically is first to show up

41
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,839
it may go unnoticed because it's a

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,320
little bit harder to go through and

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
scout

44
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,399
those particular leaves now what is the

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,759
life cycle because it's important to

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,478
understand the life cycle

47
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,920
of any sort of disease in a sense where

48
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,759
can you potentially break that life

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,240
cycle to reduce the pressure

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,879
on your plants basically what's

51
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,280
happening

52
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,158
is powdery mildew is these little

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,079
canadium

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
these candia forests are breaking apart

55
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,199
like little chains

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
they float in the air they're going

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
through they're landing on leafs or bud

58
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,359
surfaces

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
and they're going through germinating

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,200
getting their stealth established

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
getting themselves to grow again

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
producing more

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
um spores that are then being released

64
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
and kind of spreading

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
now in most situations powdery mildew

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,359
does not

67
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
uh winter over produce a sexual phase

68
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,280
within the

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,760
northern regions of the united states

70
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
but in

71
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,039
indoor grows that might be possible so

72
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,239
keep that in mind that's for some

73
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,159
outdoor species

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,439
the frost the cold weather might break

75
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,878
the cycle

76
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,400
but sometimes you're growing indoors

77
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,079
particularly in greenhouse environments

78
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
you may be able to get that perpetual

79
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
kind of

80
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,000
powdery mildew pressure also if you're

81
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,359
going near a greenhouse

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
that powdery mildew could be living in

83
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
that greenhouse overwintering

84
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,840
making it an earlier chance to get

85
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,079
powdery mildew than you would normally

86
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,080
expect

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
now that mycelium network that does

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,160
occur here it's stained

89
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,080
for powdery mildew one can see the

90
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,039
mycelium network of powdery mildew

91
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
inside the leaf

92
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,039
even if powdery mildew is not visible to

93
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,000
the human eye

94
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,759
dpi is days post inoculation hpi is the

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,719
hours past inoculation

96
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,120
so what we're noticing is this dpi hpi

97
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,479
uh

98
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,640
zero hours post inoculation two to

99
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,560
five hours one day three day we're

100
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,518
seeing that it lands on this a leaf

101
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,759
surface

102
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,680
it then spreads horizontally and then

103
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,399
it'll set down like a little foot into

104
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,879
the

105
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,519
epidermis of the plant it'll take hold

106
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,280
it'll grab

107
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,800
nutrients from the plant and it'll start

108
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400
to grow sideways and they'll start to

109
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,159
grow upwards those portions

110
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
might see them will break off and then

111
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,318
they'll go through and infect other

112
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,158
parts

113
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,359
so it's called powdery because it is a

114
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,519
powdery look to it

115
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,560
and it's able to spread very quickly in

116
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
that regards

117
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
we can see here a day's post inoculation

118
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,759
zero

119
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,000
to one to two to three to four to five

120
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,959
to six how quick that mycelium can go

121
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,560
through and spread so be mindful of that

122
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,878
now the environmental how does the

123
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
environment impact uh powdery mildew

124
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,318
well temperature moderate temperatures

125
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
are required for infection and disease

126
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,119
development

127
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,438
optimum temperatures for that conital

128
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
production is 65 to 70 degrees

129
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,719
fahrenheit and those are the little

130
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
kind of like spores you can think about

131
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,359
them that go through and spread the

132
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
powdery

133
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,840
86 plus degrees fahrenheit in greater

134
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,719
infection and spore production are

135
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,319
reduced by half 55 to 60 degrees

136
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,239
fahrenheit disease development can be

137
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,598
delayed by one or two weeks

138
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
this just shows how the outdoor

139
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,238
environment in particular we don't have

140
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,439
regulation over temperature

141
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,120
can really impact things also moisture

142
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,959
moisture is required for the pathogen to

143
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
infect and develop high humidity

144
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,478
provides sufficient moisture so air

145
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,319
exchange around plants is advised

146
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,959
especially for indoor and greenhouse

147
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,399
environments for outdoor locations shady

148
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,359
areas in a field will likely have

149
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,399
increased powdery mildew pressure now

150
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
when we're looking at hemp

151
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,599
particularly growing outdoors where

152
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,199
there is less control over the

153
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,879
environmental conditions

154
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,960
this may influence the variety you

155
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,918
select some varieties are minimally

156
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,000
susceptible

157
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,198
some extremely to extremely susceptible

158
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,959
to powdery mildew

159
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
we see just a couple listed here if

160
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,439
you're looking at considering any of

161
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
those varieties

162
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,040
what their usage might be for cbd for

163
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,319
grain for fiber and their susceptibility

164
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,680
to powdery mildew

165
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,759
great to see some of these studies

166
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,879
because it may influence what variety

167
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,400
you choose to go with

168
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,959
because it will depend on the pressure

169
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,638
you're suffering for powdery mildew

170
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,879
here's also looking at another study

171
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,680
primary data detached here of leaf

172
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,079
assays

173
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
shows some differences in susceptibility

174
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,680
these studies are continuing and we're

175
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,080
screening for additional 37 cultivars

176
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,918
and this was a study done in cornell

177
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,359
30 high cbd cultivars were screened for

178
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,198
resistance to powdery mildew

179
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
disease severity we can see some much

180
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,080
higher disease severity

181
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,799
some much less on disease severity so

182
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,399
again

183
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
some of these names might be worth

184
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,719
consideration

185
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,240
now the management of powdery mildew so

186
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,840
forget powdery mildew

187
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,439
the goal is to initially reduce the

188
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,119
feyre environment

189
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,800
continual scouting is also important to

190
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,478
catch potential problems early as they

191
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
can spread very quickly

192
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,918
this may influence plant spacing for

193
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,479
outdoor locations as well as the pruning

194
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,719
method

195
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,159
if you're an indoor grower so if you're

196
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
wondering exactly how to manage powdery

197
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
what products you should be considering

198
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,918
uh these are some suggested spray

199
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,439
products so in both situations you need

200
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,560
to know your local and current

201
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,079
regulations

202
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,399
just as a starting point for indoor

203
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,519
growers in grower rooms daily cell

204
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,359
foreburning can help reduce the

205
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,439
likelihood of seeing powdery mildew

206
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
but if you are supplementing with carbon

207
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,079
dioxide and have sensors

208
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,439
they likely will void their warranty and

209
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,318
will become ineffective

210
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,519
if you have sulfur in the air also more

211
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,360
contact products that have

212
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,519
low residuals are recommended such as

213
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,400
hydrogen dioxide or hydrogen peroxide

214
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,038
40 milk 60 water can actually help

215
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,599
suppress

216
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,120
uh spreading of powdery mildew sulfur as

217
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,199
i mentioned but it can burn the plants

218
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,879
neem oil can also burn the plants mill

219
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
stop is a potassium bicarb

220
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,079
typically not as effective as the milk

221
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
and water spray but does have some

222
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,439
effectiveness

223
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,720
but can also burn the plants potentially

224
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,319
for outdoor locations

225
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
typically the pressure can be greater

226
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,840
and while the indoor products

227
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,918
can be utilized as mentioned here

228
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,598
systemic products typically are needed

229
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,198
however i caution you if you're

230
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,879
considering using systemic products

231
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,759
particularly in later stages of cannabis

232
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,199
development

233
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
as you don't want to impact your final

234
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,879
product quality also these products have

235
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,919
the greatest chance at resistance

236
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,759
so rotations are advised so no powder

237
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,120
that can be a major problem in cannabis

238
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,879
hopefully this provides you with some

239
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
insight in identifying and controlling

240
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,120
it

241
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:15,119
if you do find it in your particular

242
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,120
plants
