1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay here we look at deep water culture

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:08,130
which is a form of hydroponics typically

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,289
abbreviated DWC could see a very simple

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,599
and basic system in this image here on

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,160
the title slide deep water culture the

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,079
basics is growing plants in aerated

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,640
water the roots grow into the nutrient

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,159
solution and it's splashed it bubbled

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,510
continually on the growing roots kind of

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,240
see a tray of that here

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,730
plants can be grown in clay pellets or

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,559
rock wall held in a pot that is put into

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,269
a larger container so it doesn't just

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,699
have to be their roots hanging down in

15
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,769
the bubbled or aerated water solution

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,380
they can be supported by some form of

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,079
other substrate such as rock wall or

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,609
these clay pebbles now this is setup

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,739
it's typically used with a five gallon

20
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,929
bucket typically they're sold as kits

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,839
there are very few moving parts but

22
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,030
however if the air pump fails so can

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,890
look an entire crop so it's being

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,109
mindful to get a quality air pump and to

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,899
keep a constant eye and monitor on that

26
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:00,420
growers should aim for a pH around 6.0

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,129
to 6.5 in the setup to help keep their

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,210
plants happy and the nutrients available

29
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:08,519
to them when cautioned growers should be

30
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,259
it's a route based diseases as they can

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,840
spread very quickly if conditions are

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,060
not kept clean and are monitored so it's

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,939
constantly looking at the plants looking

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,609
at the above growth and making sure that

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,589
the below growth is also adequate

36
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,659
because if there is a disease that could

37
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,118
come in I can spread through the entire

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,460
crop very quickly as that water is being

39
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,259
aerated encircled circulated throughout

40
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,889
all of the plants in the entire grow

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,890
operation
