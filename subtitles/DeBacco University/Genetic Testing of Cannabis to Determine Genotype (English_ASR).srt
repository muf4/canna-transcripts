1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,839
so welcome to this tobacco university

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,080
video we'll be investigating genetic

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,719
testing of cannabis to determine

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
genotype and this is kind of the picture

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,759
here looking at gregor mendel back

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,400
looking at just the morphology of the

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,839
plant

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
now when we're studying plant to next we

9
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,759
tend to use more genetic testing let me

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,679
go over some of the techniques here and

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
present the research study

12
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,679
so first off using the pcr is a very

13
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,198
common genetic tool so you hear this

14
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,000
term tossed around quite a bit what is

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,519
pcr

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,678
well it stands for polymath chain

17
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,799
reaction this is a scientific process

18
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,799
that allows for small

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,799
theoretically one sequence of dna to be

20
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,558
replicated to many copies

21
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,839
because a lot of times you're only

22
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,640
dealing with a very small

23
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
amount of dna well this is a way to kind

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
of generate

25
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,558
multiple copies to help identify if the

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,600
sequence is present in the original

27
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,038
sample

28
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,640
this is used quite a bit because it's a

29
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,679
very precise process

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,000
and therefore can be really great at

31
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,159
being able to pinpoint very specific

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,399
genetic sequences that in the scientific

33
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,759
investigator might be looking for

34
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,878
now there's genetic testing options

35
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,239
there's many different types you can

36
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:04,719
look at whether a plant is male or

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
female

38
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,478
you can get the genotype the full

39
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,719
sequencing or ip production which is

40
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,959
intellectual property protection as well

41
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,640
and all of these relate to the cannabis

42
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,759
industry directly

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,439
now the research study that i'm going to

44
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,719
be presenting some of the data from it

45
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,199
can be found right here

46
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,640
give the reference right here a link

47
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
there and kind of the picture of the

48
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,239
first page if you want to look at it in

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,240
more detail yourself

50
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,679
now first off gender detection screening

51
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,478
of cannabis so this is

52
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,118
dna sex or gender testing benefits of

53
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,840
utilizing

54
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,359
this method and this is the goal of this

55
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,719
is to be able to save time by

56
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,078
discovering if a plant is

57
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,719
a male months before it can be

58
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,639
traditional traditionally detected or

59
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,599
phenotypically detected based on the

60
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,239
visual

61
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,919
assessment of the flowers it produces by

62
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,759
being able to detect this early this can

63
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,439
save resources by identifying plants

64
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,200
early fewer plants need to be grown

65
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,199
which reduces the input such as water

66
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
labor nutrients and lighting and a whole

67
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
host of other things

68
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,359
that are needed to maximize the space to

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,799
grow plants in

70
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,399
upfront costs for the testing can be

71
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,759
justified by the reduction cost of

72
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,800
reduced plant care

73
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
at least in some instances so looking at

74
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,439
the overview of

75
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,759
samples here so again going to that

76
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,359
study that i showed earlier

77
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,359
four well-known varieties of industrial

78
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,879
hemp and six experimental varieties

79
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,640
of medicinal cannabis were included in

80
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,239
the experiment and they're kind of

81
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:28,159
listed here to give you some information

82
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,239
sample marking variety or genotype the

83
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,280
material and the source or provider of

84
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
that

85
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,360
plant material so there's three

86
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,280
different primers pairs used for sex

87
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,519
determination we can see them listed

88
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,239
right here and the key part is while

89
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,800
these are all

90
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
primers can be used they do not all have

91
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
the same reliability

92
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,879
this is referring to the actual primer

93
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,480
sequences the actual sequence of the dna

94
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,399
the amplification product and then the

95
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,598
marker's name provided here in the first

96
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,280
column

97
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,639
now this is the visualization of the pcr

98
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,400
products we're looking at

99
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,639
for sex determination of canvas

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,400
varieties and this is at the marker

101
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,679
stated right there

102
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
on the c2 a marker and this shows you

103
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,519
kind of the

104
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:08,799
different varieties there and the

105
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,680
different bandings and if you see the

106
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,599
same banning

107
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,120
that's indicating that that same dna

108
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,318
fragment exists there if you see

109
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
different bandings

110
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,158
that's going to indicate that there's

111
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,400
different lengths of those

112
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,000
dna fragments we see on the left here we

113
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,640
see the marker the ladder is as it's

114
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
called

115
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,878
with this representing 1 500 base pairs

116
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,319
this representing 100. if you ever

117
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,639
looked at a gel from pcr

118
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,158
products the larger or longer sequences

119
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,439
will be closer to where the wells where

120
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,120
the first dna was put

121
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,959
and then these smaller bands can travel

122
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
further through that gel and you see the

123
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
data presented here from the research

124
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,598
study mentioned earlier

125
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
and we kind of look at this the

126
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,840
conclusions of the studies that's the

127
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,680
actual data let's kind of get to the

128
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,400
conclusions looking at the markers that

129
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,599
they were kind of

130
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,840
investigating this scar one one nine

131
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,919
marker appeared to be the most reliable

132
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,360
for male plant detection in cannabis

133
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,199
the other two showed limited or even

134
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799
controversial results at times

135
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,318
this study confirmed that sex

136
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,959
determination of cannabis plant is a

137
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,518
complex

138
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,598
process you can see as we see and look

139
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
in the data here the genotype scoring

140
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,000
and different varieties here different

141
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,239
markers this would represent a

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,280
plant with female phenotype here's a

143
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,280
plant with male

144
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,879
phenotype this is a monostage plant

145
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,798
green color indicating

146
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,319
sample with genotype scoring in

147
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,279
accordance with phenotype the red

148
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,839
colored samples

149
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,519
with incorrect genotype indication so

150
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,679
this again shows that the scar

151
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,120
119 marker for the most part has all

152
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
that green across the row indicating it

153
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
was the most reliable

154
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
out of the ones studied and presented

155
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,918
here

156
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,439
now the cannabis genotyping just in

157
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,719
general when we're looking at that

158
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,240
genotyping

159
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
it's essential that the plant's

160
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
blueprint which includes the entire

161
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,439
spectrum of possibilities

162
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,879
for a particular cannabis plant same can

163
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,000
also be said for the human genome so

164
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,120
while this is very focused to the

165
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
cannabis industry

166
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
a lot of this also applies to other

167
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
organisms knowing precisely what defined

168
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,720
characteristics are in the plant will

169
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,399
help

170
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
guide decision making when it comes to

171
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,679
breeding that can be very important

172
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,519
particularly if you're looking at

173
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,560
breeding or introducing

174
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,560
a unique trait or strain

175
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,399
now that sequencing that i had mentioned

176
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
earlier what is sequencing what's

177
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,719
actually the kind of

178
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
sequence or the order of all of the

179
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,240
nucleotides within the dna

180
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,918
this can be used to determine the

181
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
stability and uniqueness of a cannabis

182
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,240
plant while also determining relatives

183
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,560
origin

184
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
and ancestral lineage once the genetic

185
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,519
code is known

186
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
this can allow for new and unique

187
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,319
strains

188
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,679
having record of genetic sequences can

189
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,560
allow for protection against false

190
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
patent claims

191
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,240
and other legal controversy so it's good

192
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,079
to kind of have that as like the

193
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
blueprint or sequence of the genetic

194
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,038
plants that you might be growing or

195
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,879
producing

196
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,240
lastly when we're looking at kind of

197
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,000
genetics

198
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,519
sequencing for ip production

199
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,279
intellectual property production

200
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,399
the greater amount of nucleotide bases

201
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,159
sequence the greater power of

202
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,079
differentiation can be occur

203
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,919
there are two classifications of

204
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,839
sequencing there's the targeting and

205
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,240
then there's a whole genome sequencing

206
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,359
so targeted of more than 3.5 million

207
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,439
bases

208
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,038
across thousands of high value targets

209
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,160
including 29 cannabinoid and terpene

210
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:07,918
synthesis genes

211
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
as well as several genes for seed

212
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,120
production and sex determination

213
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,198
that's where they're looking at very

214
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
kind of particular sequences that have

215
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
been identified within the whole genome

216
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
of the cannabis plant

217
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
compare that to the whole genome

218
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
sequencing this provides a data file

219
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
that contains the strain's full genetic

220
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,758
sequence

221
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,000
which can be used to identify important

222
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,240
genetic markers and determine

223
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
novelty so since chemistry um is highly

224
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
polymorphic

225
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,918
single primer sets can often have

226
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,439
reduced overall identification abilities

227
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,560
why is this important for ip production

228
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,319
we want to protect

229
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,519
what you might be developing and the

230
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,160
resources you might be putting into

231
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,038
something

232
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,840
we see here with the sandals here being

233
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:45,599
examples

234
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,279
of ones that you may read as mcdonald's

235
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
and nike initially but this is an

236
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,758
example would be ip

237
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,318
infringement where we're looking at kind

238
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
of copying something not exactly

239
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,759
if you look very closely you'll see

240
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,800
there's some code misspellings there

241
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,879
but close enough to determine that it's

242
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,759
infringing on the intellectual property

243
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,120
agreement

244
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,879
same basic thing can happen here with

245
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
the genetics where even if there's only

246
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,319
like a little slight misspelling

247
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,000
it's determined to be close enough that

248
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,080
can be advantageous for growers

249
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
particularly breeders of cannabis to

250
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,519
protect the plant material that they've

251
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,839
put so much time and effort into

252
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,839
creating
