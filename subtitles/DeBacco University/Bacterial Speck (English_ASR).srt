1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,109
okay here want to mention a little bit

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,640
about bacterial spec which really looks

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,799
like specks on the leaves and while not

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,160
all that common in cannabis it's worth

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,320
mentioning and understanding so as I

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,969
said not many have been identified the

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,339
cause issues with cannabis during a crow

8
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,230
cycle keep in mind bacteria there are

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,420
beneficial ones for example in your

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,670
intestines there's also some ones that

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,439
may cause disease so while they all may

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,029
look like little dots on a petri dish

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,910
it isn't this assuming they're all bad

14
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,379
or they're all good now where to look

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,929
for bacterial spec cultivars that

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,609
specialize in fiber production tin have

17
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,500
some where's the susceptibility to

18
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,689
bacterial infections if you're growing

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,789
one of those cultivars maybe worth

20
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,488
having a little extra scout for this

21
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,619
particular disease so most commonly a

22
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,949
grower will nose brown leaf spots that

23
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,509
may spread to the stem as well as far as

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,250
identifying characteristics for

25
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,280
bacterial spec really looks like little

26
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,960
brown specks on the on the leaves and

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,759
again those fiber production cultivars

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,850
wants to be a little bit of an extra eye

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,890
out for how to prevent it well you want

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,299
to keep conditions clean now cleaning

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,640
does that mean this is very completely

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,210
sterile clean wear nothing or other grow

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,409
but making sure that the floor is swept

34
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,868
making sure the walls may be wiped down

35
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,340
there's no dead leaves around because

36
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,650
bacteria can spread very quickly

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,030
especially in elevated temperatures so

38
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,790
we're keeping the area clean you can

39
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,460
really prevent potentially a lot of

40
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,159
chance for bacterial infections on your

41
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,809
plants how to control it it's kind of

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,570
important to remember that fungicides

43
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,540
only work on fungi and will not work on

44
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,429
bacteria oxidate which is a hardened

45
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,799
peroxide product in copper or two

46
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,700
examples of bacteria sides meaning they

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,920
actually will control a bacteria they

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,020
also have some fungicidal properties but

49
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,689
these two in particular also work on

50
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,239
bacteria to give an idea what I want to

51
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,679
talk about these brown specks this is

52
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,938
kind of an indication of what it might

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,979
look like on a leaf

54
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,798
so again bacteria very different than

55
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,899
then fungi keep in mind if you are

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,820
noticing these symptoms and want to

57
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,560
apply a control product don't waste your

58
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,538
time with fungicides make sure the

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,420
product you're using is in some way a

60
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,409
bacterial side to help reduce the spread

61
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,109
and control

62
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:19,460
of this bacteria from spreading

63
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,460
throughout your entire plant
