1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,469
so in this lecture series we're gonna be

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,869
looking at osmoregulation

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,609
in fish now this is something you may

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,019
have to pause the video at certain times

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,808
to get a review and look at what some of

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,070
the images have I think if you once you

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,138
look at the whole thing it might make

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,028
more sense but initially I know this

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,820
section can be a little confusing so

10
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:23,129
we're looking at salmon here and striped

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,118
bass both of these fish are involved in

12
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:30,479
osmoregulation so it's a balancing act

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,759
the physiological system of fish operate

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,500
in an internal fluid environment that

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,570
may not match their external fluid

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,469
environment meaning the water inside the

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,700
cells of the fish may not match the

18
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,429
concentrations of salts on the water

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,170
outside the fish relative concentrations

20
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,808
of water and solids internally must be

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,910
maintained with very narrow limits this

22
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,530
is part of homeostasis so we can't

23
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,419
change the fish we can only change how

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,910
the fish is reacting to the environment

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,559
the internal environment is influenced

26
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,718
by the external environment the sense of

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,640
what the fish has to do this is a clown

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,948
fish living in salt water and this is a

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,079
sunfish living in freshwater we

30
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,629
understand what stress is most of these

31
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,060
fish are under so starting just in

32
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:15,089
general osmoregulation it's regulating

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,299
solute concentrations and balances the

34
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,859
gain or loss of water cells require a

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,890
balance between uptake and loss of water

36
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:26,219
excretion should make sense is it

37
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,519
getting rid of nitrogen metabolites and

38
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,509
other waste products so this is

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,269
balancing act

40
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,560
this Ã¶zil regulation and excretion Osmel

41
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,569
regulation is based largely on

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,250
controlled movement of solutes between

43
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,919
the internal fluids in the external

44
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,259
environment there's this balancing act

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,420
that's occurring the fish in this case

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,099
is trying to maintain homeostasis but

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,590
the external environment could put a lot

48
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,679
of pressures on the cell and the

49
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,380
stresses on the cell so starting here as

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,299
a lot of challenges Osmo regulators

51
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,618
expend energy to control water uptake

52
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,719
and loss in a hyper osmotic or hypo

53
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:05,938
osmotic environment you may want to

54
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,589
review the diffusion and osmosis lecture

55
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,060
series if you're confused on some of

56
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,469
this well let's look at some of these

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,140
just in general this is comparing to

58
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:15,120
fish so we have our four

59
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:17,669
water fish and our saltwater fisher

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,080
sunfish and our clown fish the fish

61
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:23,669
salinity IV officially is 14 percent

62
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,610
that means the salt concentration inside

63
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:29,569
the cells in this fish is 14 percent

64
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:33,000
same thing here on our contest also 14

65
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:36,090
percent what is different val the

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,569
freshwater in water that's living in has

67
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,150
zero percent saline day it's freshwater

68
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:45,629
versus our clownfish has 35 percent salt

69
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,789
water as a result salts being absorbed

70
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,509
by the gills it's gaining water through

71
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:53,400
as moses look at the arrows pointing in

72
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:56,370
these fish do not drink because water is

73
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,650
being pushed in through osmosis a large

74
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,530
amount of dilute urine is evident in

75
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,110
freshwater fish contrast set to salt

76
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,870
water finish look at the arrows going in

77
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:12,630
there drinking seawater and what's being

78
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:15,330
excreted is salt through the gills it's

79
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,639
losing water through osmosis and small

80
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,600
amount of concentrated salty urine so

81
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,189
this is because of the different

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,389
environments that these two fish are in

83
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:26,759
looking specifically at that freshwater

84
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,099
fish when i say that live in a hypotonic

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:33,048
environment think back to this slide

86
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:35,579
here hypotonic if they did not regulate

87
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,560
the water intake these two should

88
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,079
essentially swell up to the point that

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,750
they could lice or burst their cells as

90
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,939
a result this water is constant beating

91
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,310
into as moses some salts being absorbed

92
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,409
by the gills they excrete a large amount

93
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,659
of dilute hearing a lot of water is

94
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:55,049
being excreted simply because the cells

95
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:56,219
again have 14% higher concentration

96
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,670
versus their a percent water is

97
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:02,250
constantly trying to move in as a result

98
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,199
these fish do not quote drink and this

99
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,049
is referring to the water fresh water

100
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,599
fish constantly take water by osmosis

101
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:11,159
they lose salts by diffusion and balance

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,169
it by excreting large amounts of dilute

103
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,030
urine salts lost by diffusion are

104
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,668
replaced in foods and the uptake across

105
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,000
their gills this isn't just a statement

106
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:22,348
of what the previous image shows so if

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,449
you found the previous slide better

108
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:27,769
that's great if not this puts it into

109
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:30,300
some nice bullets

110
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:32,849
freshwater fish challenges they tend to

111
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,800
lose ions and they tend to be gaining

112
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,620
water these are a couple fish species

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,050
for common to freshwater I've been in my

114
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,819
classroom and you're fortunate enough to

115
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,000
work at the pan fish lab station this is

116
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,939
a couple pan fish here they are black

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,449
crappie here yellow perch and in our sub

118
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:54,089
fish now let's look at this marine bony

119
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,860
fish our saltwater fish they live in a

120
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:59,129
hypertonic environment so what is

121
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,900
continually being lost as Moses water

122
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:02,850
lost as Moses because of the

123
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,219
concentration remember our fish still

124
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,960
has a 14 percent salinity but in this

125
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,770
case now our water is 35 percent

126
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,569
salinity it does drink seawater and salt

127
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,519
is being excreted through the gills as

128
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,420
well as small amounts of contrary

129
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:21,000
concentrated salty turns being lost

130
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,770
putting that into couple bolts here they

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,959
lose water by osmosis gain salt by

132
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,819
diffusion from food balanced water loss

133
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,789
by drinking seawater excreting salts and

134
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:32,040
filtration rates below very little urine

135
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,629
is excreted if nothing happened they

136
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,850
would shrivel up this is the type of

137
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:38,129
environment or stresses that's on them

138
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,990
and this again shows another image here

139
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,300
where we're seeing the direction of

140
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,790
movement of both water and ions sea

141
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,280
drinking seawater a lot being lost

142
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,930
through the gills and yelled salty urine

143
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,379
water through the skin is being

144
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:56,129
exchanged also a couple examples of

145
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:58,379
marine fish freshwater fish we talked

146
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,079
about this is marine fish so these are

147
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,019
fish that live in marine or saltwater

148
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,469
environments they tend to lose water and

149
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:09,689
gain ions so this is a flounder blue

150
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,780
fish and false albick are all examples

151
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:15,509
of marine fish these have very different

152
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,339
challenges than the freshwater fish and

153
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:21,719
all of these fish were caught in Long

154
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:23,609
Island Sound osmotic challenges again

155
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,930
this kind of shows you again our ozma

156
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,580
regular is explaining that energy to

157
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,019
uptake water as I said you may have to

158
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,629
pause the video and look at everything

159
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,759
that's going on here makes a great quiz

160
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:34,259
question for being able to compare the

161
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,620
stresses of freshwater fish and

162
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,230
saltwater fish so see some commonalities

163
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,800
and see some differences I try to keep

164
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,720
everything

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,728
same color look at the arrows and what's

166
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,020
moving in and out of the fish those are

167
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:51,990
examples of fish now we're looking at

168
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:54,750
pacifically sharks sharks fit into the

169
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:59,490
category is particularly sharks into

170
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,279
what we call Osmo conformers only some

171
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,168
of marine animals are ISO osmotic with

172
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,649
the surroundings and do not regulate

173
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:10,829
their osmolarity this means that the

174
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:13,109
fish salinity is 35% which is the same

175
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:16,288
as the environment that it lives in at

176
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,968
35 percent as a result they're ingesting

177
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:21,029
salts with their food water's being

178
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:23,610
absorbed to the gills and skin and salt

179
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,918
is excreted to the earing Osmo

180
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,000
conformers they're conforming to the

181
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,538
environment that they're in

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,149
as a result these sharks do not move

183
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:36,180
into areas with lower salinity into

184
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:39,750
brackish water because it would mess up

185
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,500
their ability to exchange ions water

186
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,560
ozmo conformers are conforming 35% fish

187
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,589
salinity 35% salt water salinity they're

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,028
conforming to their environment that

189
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:51,899
term osmolarity to sea having a

190
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:53,610
definition for it

191
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,318
solute concentration of a solution

192
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,900
determines the movement of water across

193
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,819
its actively permeable membrane this is

194
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:04,038
just referring to concentration of a

195
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:07,110
solution types of Osmo regulators

196
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,149
aquatic vertebrates gills are chief

197
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,330
organs for excretion themselves is a

198
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:14,128
carp kidneys are also evolved as Osmo

199
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,019
over guitar organs and fishes to remove

200
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,468
water or conserve water these are

201
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:22,859
examples of couple kidneys put it in a

202
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:24,959
graphical form if your asthma regulator

203
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,509
versus a conformer so if you're a strict

204
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,579
regulator it does not matter the

205
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,870
external conditions your internal

206
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,578
conditions are going to be strictly

207
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,370
regulated regulated meeting going to be

208
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:38,038
the same if you're a strict conformer as

209
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,429
the external environment increases so

210
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,990
does your internal environment

211
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:47,370
now an example of that would be salmon

212
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:50,159
they are strict as you see here not

213
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,870
conformal district regulators and in

214
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,750
this case this worm would be a strict

215
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,610
conformer so we flip back for a

216
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,220
I can see our regulators are regulating

217
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,940
they're maintaining that homeostasis

218
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,279
conformers are just changing what the

219
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,200
environment is perfect example here our

220
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,620
salmon regulating and our worm

221
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,840
conforming now when they conform this

222
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,269
organism Exodus label is general

223
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,950
organism just because they are

224
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,370
conformers does that mean they can live

225
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,960
and survive it that entire scale here

226
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,330
this is the area where this organ can

227
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,519
live if that salinity of the external

228
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,900
conditions gets too low this case is to

229
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,210
be the shark moving into brackish water

230
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,720
they can die it's lethal or if it's too

231
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,820
salty

232
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,740
it can also die there's this area where

233
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,250
they can live too high and too low could

234
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,200
be lead to death we looking at aquatic

235
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,419
organisms that are able to tell a wide

236
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,310
range of salinities

237
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:44,309
we have our American shad and our

238
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:46,349
American eel they move between the ocean

239
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:48,209
and rivers for spawning and reproduction

240
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,050
they spend part of their time in

241
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,430
saltwater in part and freshwater

242
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:55,199
migrating some migrate to the sea so

243
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:59,549
migrate off the river and the

244
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,470
Connecticut River here salmon I can come

245
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:04,889
up the river well we don't have a lot of

246
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,580
salmon we everyone smile couple come up

247
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:11,129
but we really have shad so shad kind of

248
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,800
did the same that salmon do they live

249
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:16,289
most of their time in the ocean and they

250
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,329
spawn in rivers and freshwater systems

251
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:21,029
they migrate up by the thousands of up

252
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,920
the Connecticut River beetles are doing

253
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,659
just the opposite they spend most of the

254
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,279
time feeding and growing in the river

255
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,219
and they're working their way down to

256
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,899
the ocean to reproduce so a Jonathas

257
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,639
fish are they like the American shad

258
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,110
they own that's been a very short time

259
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,199
in the river eyes are coming up to spawn

260
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,750
just shows that life cycle here is an

261
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,950
example the Connecticut River and where

262
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,360
things are going in estuaries and

263
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,960
freshwater and where they're living and

264
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,240
migrating to in the springtime eels are

265
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,920
working their way down south here to

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,589
where the ocean water is where this

267
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,939
salinity is higher and salmon or

268
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:59,000
American shad be working their way up

269
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:01,710
the river here here's some examples

270
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,929
convert salt water as adaptations to

271
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,150
freshwater and vice versa depending on

272
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,639
the direction of the migration and sea

273
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,500
they drink seawater and discharge salt

274
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,240
Gill's and in fresh water they stop

275
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,029
drinking and produce large leaves and

276
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,620
dilute urine in the gills uptake cell

277
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,470
not every fish can do this this is a

278
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,320
stress on the fish this kind of shows

279
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,690
where the American shad migrate up the

280
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,980
Connecticut River rocky here would be

281
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,810
approximately right about here

282
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Middletown so it takes that little notch

283
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:34,439
so they can jump a very long way here at

284
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,330
the Holyoke dam they lifted the shad

285
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,940
over and they count them that's about 80

286
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:42,240
miles here and it can continue all the

287
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,220
way up through Massachusetts most spawn

288
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,370
in southern part Massachusetts in in

289
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,259
Connecticut waters so how do we do

290
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,090
stress in a stressed fish this is if you

291
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,710
get one you want to bring it home you

292
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,149
want to minimize the osmotic challenges

293
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,240
by placing the fish in conditions that

294
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:59,309
are I saw osmotic this could be to add

295
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,710
salt to the fresh water when

296
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:04,399
transporting fish this dilute salt for

297
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:07,139
the same situation for marine species

298
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,209
and its little cartoon here shows you

299
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,699
saw your life force dressed this poor

300
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,830
fish is really hoping no one pushes any

301
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,590
of these buttons and the power is up to

302
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,360
this circuit lastly we want to think

303
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,920
about more than just osmoregulation and

304
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,600
fish there's also temperature to

305
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,909
consider temperature exhibits their

306
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,070
greatest influence on fish texture

307
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,110
metabolism their digestion signals to

308
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,150
reproduce so if adding your fish to an

309
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,399
aquarium or pond be sure there's no

310
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,559
temperature or salinity shock and you

311
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,370
increase the odds that fish is going to

312
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,369
survive the next 12-24 hours

313
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,370
dramatically
