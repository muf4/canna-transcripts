1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,629
if you were to look at hydroponic

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,519
substrates while most people think

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,740
hydroponics is growing purely in water

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,739
there is the option to run some

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,210
substrates these substrates qualify

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,070
under hydroponics because they're not

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,100
eating any mineral content to the plant

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,339
they're purely adding an area for a root

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,170
support in gross in these substrates

10
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,239
they allow for a wide margin a wider

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,769
margin of error for the plants compared

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,618
to if we're growing in just pure water

13
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,358
solution they hold nutrients in water in

14
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,250
case of pump failure so that can buffer

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,660
you in case you're looking you know

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,670
monitoring the pump and then the pump

17
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,468
fails use a little bit of that window of

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,539
opportunity to realize that before you

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,489
lose the entire crop they also provide

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,320
physical structure for the roots they

21
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,320
also important to insulate the plant

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,350
roots from large swings in temperature

23
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,820
versus just a water based system now

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,320
there's water holding capacity is the

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,570
amount of nutrient solution that can be

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,270
absorbed so how absorbent is the media

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,789
or substrate that you're using here Coco

28
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,350
car and Rocco wool rock wall can hold

29
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,780
five to eight times their weight in

30
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,909
water which means less irrigation events

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,769
are needed it can dress expanded clay

32
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,210
pebbles hold very little water resulting

33
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,118
in the need for almost continuous

34
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,399
irrigation with those so again it's

35
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,519
important to know what substrate or what

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,868
media you're using and how absorbent it

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,728
is for materials because that's it's

38
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,310
going to depend on the irrigation events

39
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:25,170
that you choose to use air-filled

40
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,269
porosity so the amount of airspace in

41
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,909
the media it is important since roots

42
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,219
need to breathe or respire to be able to

43
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,079
exchange oxygen if making your own mix

44
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,060
using perlite can help increase the

45
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,009
amount of air in the root zone in the

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,109
overall drainage and we could see that

47
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,030
evident here of a high porosity mix a

48
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,188
lot of area for that air pockets to fit

49
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,579
in a lot of opportunity for your roots

50
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:50,099
to have access to oxygen now CEC or

51
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,408
cation exchange capacity how well the

52
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,078
substrate can hold on to and release

53
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,579
positive ions at the plant roots low CC

54
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,319
is poor ability to hold nutrients for

55
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,539
example rock wall this doesn't

56
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,069
necessarily mean it's a bad substrate it

57
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
just means we have to be aware of that

58
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,508
when we're making our plan Coco car is a

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,090
very high seating can hold on to key

60
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,098
nutrients so strongly that the plant

61
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,620
cannot have access to them this is why

62
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,299
for growing in a Coco car solution

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,060
our media I should say typically a

64
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,120
calcium in magnesium based nutrient mix

65
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,090
is recommended on regular intervals for

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,769
those growers in that situation the

67
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,310
cocoa cars derived from the husks of

68
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,629
coconuts

69
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,400
it can hold calcium and make it

70
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,018
unavailable to the plants and this is

71
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,120
why a cal-mag solution is typically

72
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,969
recommended you want to make sure that

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,069
you're rinsing and removing any unwanted

74
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,930
salts from the original material if they

75
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:42,419
are not done so when at the time of

76
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,830
purchase it can be a variable product

77
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,119
from batch to batch so keep this in mind

78
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,549
that just because you have a good batch

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,379
don't expect that necessary that same

80
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,750
quantity edge in every batch should

81
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,949
always be testing those and making sure

82
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,530
that everything is flowing within the

83
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,119
parameters that you need however it does

84
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,180
hold moisture very well so that is one

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,950
great positive to it but also keep in

86
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,680
mind of the source material and

87
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,419
sustainability of that now with expanded

88
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,189
clay pebbles one they are replacement

89
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,048
for soil they're easy to use in the RV

90
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,299
usable though you want to make sure you

91
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,430
always rinse them before you use them

92
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,459
because there will be a fine kind of

93
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,480
clay dust that will wash away if you

94
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,159
don't do that ahead of time that could

95
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,078
clog your pumps or caused asura residue

96
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,729
and other issues I also want to make

97
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,189
sure you take the time to get them

98
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:28,858
properly saturated when first using

99
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:31,530
these do have a very high CEC and can

100
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,359
basically not be over irrigated as a

101
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,759
result many people run irrigation over

102
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,379
them 24 hours a day there should be at

103
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,909
least four inches deep to prevent light

104
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,068
penetration which can negatively impact

105
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,449
root growth if they're too shallow and

106
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:44,729
roots try to grow and they see light

107
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,768
well you'll stunt the roots having that

108
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,179
four inches or so barrier prevents life

109
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,280
and penetrating and allowing the roots

110
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,900
to expand normally they can get about

111
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,870
fifteen percent more weight after they

112
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,810
sow broccoli maybe like a hundred sorry

113
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,090
thousand and eleven hundred percent or

114
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,650
so greater on in their weight so if

115
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,939
you're transitioning from a rock wall to

116
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,919
a clay pebbles or clay pebbles to

117
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,829
Rockville keep in mind that can be vast

118
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,689
different eleven hundred percent greater

119
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,120
more water retention with Rockville

120
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,889
versus only fifteen percent with clay

121
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,840
pebbles again doesn't mean this is

122
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,120
necessary bad MIDI to choose just be

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,250
mindful of its natural characteristics

124
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,408
that Rockville is a commercial grower

125
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,968
favorite need to pre-soak the cubes if

126
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:26,098
you do use them about five to fifteen

127
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,969
minutes depending on their size longer

128
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,949
time for larger

129
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,470
cubes I'm not sure you shake the cubes

130
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,839
before inserting them into a tray or

131
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,610
whatever holding the device that you're

132
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,929
using you don't want to squeeze them you

133
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,939
squeeze them to kind of crush in all the

134
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,620
air out very quick and easy for

135
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,629
transplanting that's why the commercial

136
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,360
growers favorite and they have a great

137
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,909
ability to hold water and also air to

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,129
allow those roots to breathe sand

139
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,170
provides good plant support it should be

140
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,540
sterilized before you use it but it can

141
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,819
be very heavy also it doesn't hold water

142
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,770
very well due to its large particle size

143
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,750
and it can also make the transplant

144
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:02,039
process difficult what happens is when

145
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,920
you go to pull a plant out if you're

146
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,319
using sand I can disturb many of the

147
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,470
fine roots and cause increased stress

148
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,750
for your next step down on the growing

149
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,340
scale of the season so all these have

150
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,540
pros and cons with them you want to

151
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:20,369
choose one that fits your size or your

152
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,319
production well this is why there's so

153
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,970
many options out there and available to

154
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,589
you so take a look at them hopefully

155
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,200
this was helpful and allowing you to

156
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:30,209
understand hydroponic substrates and

157
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,099
realize hydroponics is more than just

158
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:34,099
growing in pure water-based solution
