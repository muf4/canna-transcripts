1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to this tobacco university we'll

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,480
be exploring a video here

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,919
on polyplotization for the genetic

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,839
improvement of cannabis

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,199
sativa and specifically we're going to

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,839
be breaking down

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,160
a scientific study that looked at

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,198
investigating this particular type

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
of polyploidy levels in cannabis

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
sativa now when talking about polity

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
levels just keep in mind we are diploid

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,358
organisms so polyploating is referring

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,599
to

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,199
an abnormal or an increased number in

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,559
copies here and we'll explain that more

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,800
as the video goes on

17
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,399
first off i want to be mindful that this

18
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,599
is the research article if you want to

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,359
look at it yourself

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,039
provided with the reference here the

21
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,679
citation and a direct link

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,960
as well as a copy of the first page here

23
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,399
so first off what is this poly

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,878
politicalization well

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,160
this is the multiplication of the whole

26
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,759
chromosome

27
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,000
complement that has occurred frequently

28
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,799
in vascular plants so just as a quick

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,238
biology review your haploid is your

30
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,198
gametes in this case if we're talking

31
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,038
about plants

32
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,238
this would be your egg cells or your

33
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,000
pollen grains

34
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,519
diploid would be the normal organism but

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,319
here we're looking at the polyplusation

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
the

37
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,879
3n or the tetraploid the 4n multiple

38
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,239
copies here from what would be

39
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,239
considered normal

40
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,000
the main the maintenance of a stable

41
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,599
polyploid state over generations

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,438
requires specific mechanisms

43
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,438
to control pairing and distribution of

44
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,919
more than two homologous chromosomes

45
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,599
during meiosis so that's just a brief

46
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,079
overview of what we're investigating

47
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,759
here

48
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,640
we'll get to see this how this actually

49
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,879
changes the canvas plant's morphology

50
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
so first off why investigate this in the

51
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,438
first place you know what's the

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,438
justification for even

53
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,438
considering this well the poly

54
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,478
politicalization is considered a viable

55
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,239
tool in the genetic

56
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,679
improvement of crop plants the

57
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,839
evolutionary success of

58
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,880
polyploid plants in nature and under

59
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
domestication

60
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,078
has been attributed to the buffering of

61
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,280
mutations

62
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,399
we see this in comparison looking at the

63
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
regular diploid

64
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,439
compared to some of the other types of

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,718
ploidy levels most

66
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:57,839
evident here with the strawberries we

67
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,599
have a wild strawberries to our

68
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
cultivated strawberries everyone wants

69
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,839
larger bigger fruits and this is kind of

70
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
one way

71
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,118
potentially through genetics and these

72
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,159
polly levels

73
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,360
to accomplish this so looking

74
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,318
specifically now at

75
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,480
cannabis leaves collected on leaf

76
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,079
stomata morphology of mature fan

77
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,519
leaves so we're seeing this comparison

78
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
here of a

79
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
is diploid b it's tetraploid we see the

80
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,159
same thing here with the stomata with c

81
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
and d so the leaves collected after four

82
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,000
weeks is vegetative growth and one week

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
under flowering lights that's when this

84
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,439
material was collected from the plants

85
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,199
down here this black and white images

86
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,959
we're looking at nail polish impressions

87
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,759
to show the stomata on the

88
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,319
uh kind of underside surface of the fan

89
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,878
leaves

90
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,399
the ab axel um surface now when we talk

91
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,399
about nail polish impressions it's

92
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
literally kind of a way that you can put

93
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,000
nail polish down and kind of lift that

94
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
to get an idea of what the stomata look

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
like remember the stomata are the pores

96
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,439
in the underside of the leaves

97
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,878
that regulate water loss and carbon

98
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,719
dioxide intake

99
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,479
so you want to appear larger in size on

100
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,080
the tetrapointed plants we see that

101
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,560
right here these bars represent the same

102
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
size

103
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
see these are clearly larger than the

104
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,479
diploid organisms here

105
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
then looked at trichome density so

106
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,399
specifically speaking to trichomes which

107
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,560
knows very important in cannabis plants

108
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,080
when we're looking at trichomes the

109
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,479
images show the trichome density

110
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
again at that same leaf surface there of

111
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,119
the fourth sugar leaf of cannabis sativa

112
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,439
strain

113
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,878
plants a and b are diploid so here's a

114
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,120
and b these are both diploid

115
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,639
c and d are the tetraploid down here

116
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
leaves were imaged on the seventh week

117
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,919
of flowering and note the sidebars

118
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
oh sorry the scale bars are one

119
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,598
millimeter to give you a size

120
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
comparison there we can clearly see that

121
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,199
there is definitely

122
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,280
more trichomes or the increased density

123
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,639
here on the tetraploids

124
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
now the inflorescence architecture

125
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,919
looking at the specific colas or the

126
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,639
flowers here

127
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,439
the influence apex top cola and buds

128
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,119
shown in the

129
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,959
for two plants during the eighth week of

130
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
flowering of cannabis sativa strain

131
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,479
week 12 after transplanting and one week

132
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,158
before harvesting you an idea when this

133
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,479
was occurring in this plant

134
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,318
a and b are diploid i'm sorry a and c

135
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,959
are the diploid here in the same column

136
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,438
here

137
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,438
b and d here are the tetraploid and

138
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,598
images a and b represent the cola

139
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,120
and c and d represent the bud morphology

140
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,119
a little bit closer there

141
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,319
again we've not seen stark differences

142
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,400
here but if you look at them long enough

143
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,319
you can definitely see that there are

144
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,560
some morphological differences in the

145
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,478
influence architecture

146
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
now looking more at the data so that's

147
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,560
kind of the large scale look well how do

148
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,960
these actually compare when we look at

149
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,600
some of the graphs in data generated

150
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,120
well the phytochemical content dried

151
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
buds and leaves of cannabis sativa

152
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,959
plants of different

153
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,478
ploidy were assessed using hplc and gc

154
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,519
for cannabinoids and terpenes

155
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,120
that's high pressure liquid

156
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,198
chromatography and gas chromatography

157
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,959
there are those abbreviations

158
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,319
a is the cannabinoid profile so we can

159
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,638
see right up here and b

160
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,680
is the terpene profile of the chart down

161
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,360
at the bottom

162
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,040
data or means plus or minus the standard

163
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
error where 10 diploids and nine

164
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
tetraploids were

165
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,240
analyzed means of different upper and

166
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,600
lower case letters are significantly

167
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
different using the anova

168
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
with two keys post hoc test with a p

169
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,918
value uh

170
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,600
greater than 0.05 to give you an idea of

171
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,879
the statistics behind this

172
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,240
now what's the summary here as we kind

173
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,519
of look at the bars and different colors

174
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
we're looking at here

175
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,879
well the phytochemical content in the

176
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
lower leaves is high enough

177
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,399
for the trim leaf material to be used

178
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,120
for extraction in both pleity

179
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,959
levels studies which can which could

180
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
almost double the total production

181
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,359
yields that's important remember that

182
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
the dried trim leaf material also does

183
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,080
contain

184
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,000
a levels that would be worth going

185
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,680
through the phase of extraction

186
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,839
total chirping content of tetrapod

187
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
leaves is comparable to the diploid bud

188
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,119
interpreting extracts from the

189
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,759
tetraploid leaves may have commercial

190
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,319
value despite low levels of cannabinoids

191
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
and we kind of see that comparison there

192
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,560
looking at our diplomatic tetraploid

193
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
our differences here again everything is

194
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,918
reduced in the leaf overall but does

195
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,359
give it some thought there

196
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,120
as far as potentially taking that

197
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,879
material not just discarding it

198
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,959
but going through the process of

199
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,399
extraction and here in the diploid we

200
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,879
see the leaves being uh

201
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,478
lower than the buds uh and here we see

202
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,600
the leaves overall being a little bit

203
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,478
higher we see that blood definitely

204
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
being a b

205
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,599
making it's a little bit higher there

206
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,240
indicating more genetic

207
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,840
similarities here but beating distinctly

208
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,079
higher in the tetraploid bud

209
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,439
compared to the diploid there so again

210
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,120
just looking at some of the stats we can

211
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,279
clearly see there are some differences

212
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,759
on the phytochemical content

213
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,879
now what do these results indicate well

214
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,879
tetrapod

215
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,639
canvas plants generally grow comparable

216
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,240
to traditional diploids so that's a good

217
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,600
note for those that are

218
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
actively growing this plant it's going

219
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,160
to behave pretty simple the tetrapod

220
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,000
cannabis plants reduced rooting was

221
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,720
noted so that's just might be an area of

222
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,879
concern

223
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
or something to keep an eye on tetrapod

224
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,159
chemists have

225
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,159
a similar chemical profile to diploids

226
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,560
with notable increases in cbd

227
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
and subsequent terpenes so that increase

228
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,918
in cbd

229
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,959
is important and that's what makes it

230
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,399
advantageous

231
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,120
to be potentially considering this as a

232
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,279
grower here of producing cannabis to

233
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,399
look at tetraploids potentially

234
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,638
so what's that kind of grower's

235
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,478
suggestion general summary well using

236
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
polyplusation canvas plans

237
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,478
may be an effective method for

238
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,318
maximizing cbd and terpene production so

239
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,680
that's a very important note there

240
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,960
i do want to make note that if you do

241
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
read the article in a little bit more

242
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,359
detail

243
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,959
they do state that really they did not

244
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
see much of a change in the

245
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,359
thc levels but it was noticed in cbd and

246
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
definitely terpene production

247
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,199
for these polyploids so again just

248
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,719
something there to consider

249
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,319
something you may not have been thinking

250
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
of before and this

251
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,879
just allows or shows how scientific

252
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,120
research can really potentially

253
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,079
continue the breeding process in the

254
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,439
improving

255
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,439
of cannabis plants
