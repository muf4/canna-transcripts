1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,619
in this video as the title suggests I'm

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,960
gonna go over mitosis but I'm also gonna

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,839
be mentioning interphase and cytokinesis

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,580
a good summary slide provided here a

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,789
couple more of those will occur

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,980
throughout the video presentation so

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,948
starting with mitosis it is involved

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,230
with cell replication it cells making

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,420
more identical copies of cells and

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,339
identicals the key word here if we're

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,470
not having identical copies we have

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,198
mutations good to give it simply the

13
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,659
copy machine we want to produce as close

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,429
to the original as possible that way we

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,509
can ensure the same functions of

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:42,149
ourselves the cell cycle or two main

17
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:44,549
components interphase in mitosis so

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,789
mitosis is actually the courses of cell

19
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:50,099
division interphase those a little

20
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:53,219
slightly different phase there are

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,100
subdivisions of interphase those being

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,039
the g0 which is just a resting phase g1

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,770
is the growth in metabolism s DNA

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,899
replication g2 is growth of structural

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,609
elements and n is actually the mitosis

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,969
phase this gives a little bit of

27
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:11,430
approximation of time even idea of the

28
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:16,019
eukaryotic replication cycle that does

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,490
occur mitosis here broken dinh these

30
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,489
phases at prophase prometaphase

31
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:23,429
metaphase anaphase telophase and then

32
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:26,699
cytokinesis interphase here is that g2

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,920
phase is occurring in the interphase is

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,659
the stage where living cells are when

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,250
they're not dividing it's indicated by

36
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,979
chromosomes not being visible with a

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,170
light microscope here is our interface

38
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,700
to the gray region here mitosis is

39
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,189
occurring this darker region

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,879
you can see again those terms do one s

41
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:50,639
and g2 interphase is g1 is referring to

42
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,938
when the cell increases in size s is

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,409
again that DNA replication portion in g2

44
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,718
is the mitochondrion other organelles

45
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,490
begin to divide before the cell actually

46
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:04,949
enters officially mitosis you could see

47
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,629
here mitosis is basically cell division

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,239
and there's four main steps plus the

49
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:11,818
last step of cytokinesis kind of broken

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,620
out in different than the four main

51
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,628
steps of mitosis there

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,969
Kherson the meristems which are stem

53
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:20,340
tips or there's a lot of actively

54
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,530
dividing cells and root tips there's a

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,848
lot of athlete's dividing cells can

56
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,739
occur to other parts throughout the

57
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:27,359
plant but these are areas where you're

58
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,170
likely to find a high rate of cell

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,360
division Starla's prophase chromosomes

60
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,789
form into chromatids so we have our

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,739
chromosomes forming into our sister

62
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,650
chromatids with their replication phase

63
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,628
and ever going into mitosis where we're

64
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,969
basically separating those out to form

65
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:46,318
two identical cells this shows a little

66
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:51,378
bit an example here our sister

67
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:54,328
chromatids located in the nucleus

68
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:58,560
prophase chromatin condenses into

69
00:02:54,329 --> 00:03:00,900
chromosomes the nucleolus disappears so

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,060
nuclear envelope fragments and nucleolus

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,879
disintegrates remember the nucleolus

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,158
from our organelles is where the our RNA

73
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,959
is made we're looking at that nuclear

74
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,000
envelope and loping into fragment

75
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,810
chromatids are condensing making them

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,239
more visible prophase our polar

77
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,098
microtubules shown in green kind of in

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
this image here are strands that

79
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:25,918
established a matrix around the

80
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:29,848
currently intact nucleus this will break

81
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,109
down and we'll fragment but right now

82
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:35,159
it's still intact what we're seeing this

83
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:37,620
webbing being I'm starting to occur the

84
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,840
condensing chromosomes are in blue here

85
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,750
the red dots kind of pinkish dots we see

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,310
here are the centromeres and that's

87
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,979
involved with DNA Pro metaphase is kind

88
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,719
of in-between prophase in metaphase so

89
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,108
we have our spindle fibers anchoring at

90
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:58,348
the poles goes here and here the nuclear

91
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:02,159
membrane fully breaks down and our could

92
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:04,979
be the core microtubules invade the

93
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,829
nuclear space these Kaneda cores are now

94
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,750
starting to attach to the chromosomes

95
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,060
and are starting to get some level of

96
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,669
organization now that the nucleus is

97
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,160
broken down we see a little bit the

98
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,859
change here I'm prometaphase the nuclear

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,349
membrane has just basically broken apart

100
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,379
the microtubules quickly interact with

101
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:27,180
the heater cores which assemble the

102
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,219
centromeres to condense

103
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,959
chromosomes so what's this mean well

104
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,870
because our nucleus is breaking apart

105
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,209
we now need these fibers to grab on to

106
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,069
these chromosomes to be able to hold on

107
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,569
to them and get them in alignment as

108
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:43,228
we're going through the process of cell

109
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,839
division metaphase here chromosomes line

110
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:48,060
up along the metaphase plate now we call

111
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,489
the metaphase plate on lining up on the

112
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,470
equator that we have on the globe here

113
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,590
but remember this is an imaginary plane

114
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,750
both on the globe and also in the cell

115
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:01,019
there's no true plate that they're all

116
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,029
kind of lining up and pressing on

117
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,339
it's just lining up in that middle and

118
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:07,439
imaginary kind of line but they do form

119
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:11,519
this line just like the equator on the

120
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,110
globe metaphase spindle favell's

121
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,779
attached to the centromeres is right

122
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,129
here centromere is that red region and

123
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:19,288
that's kind of where these two join

124
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,180
together and that is a point of

125
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:23,909
attachment that will then allow these

126
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,418
two then be separated and broken apart

127
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,550
to form the two identical cells we kind

128
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,439
of see that forming here middle

129
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,689
fluorescence microscope will tip this

130
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,759
image our centromeres have moved to the

131
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,129
poles in the cell have established any

132
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,319
of the metallic spindle the chromosomes

133
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,060
have condensed anna metaphase plate kind

134
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:48,060
of see a little bit of a line up here in

135
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:50,250
that central imaginary region Anna fades

136
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,259
this is the shortest time to complete of

137
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,029
all the phases centrioles are broken

138
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,550
apart the two sister chromatids into

139
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:58,679
debtor chromosomes basically we see that

140
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,658
we're all initially lined up on the

141
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,728
plate and now they're being broken apart

142
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:04,740
and pulled to the poles here

143
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:06,300
this happens in unison you can see

144
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,098
they're all kind of in alignment it

145
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,460
happens in the least amount of time is

146
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:13,348
any of the phases of mitosis anaphase

147
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,089
the chromosomes break at the centromeres

148
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:17,129
and sister chromatids move to opposite

149
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:18,508
ends of the cell again those daughter

150
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,370
chromosomes are then moving towards the

151
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:24,319
poles remember this all happened

152
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,490
basically at the same time in unison

153
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,009
anaphase could see that example here I

154
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,168
get the idea that pulling here are

155
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,979
kinetochore microtubules are pulling the

156
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:36,990
two sets towards the poles here this is

157
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,800
creating two halves and dividing cell

158
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,459
further apart

159
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,348
well the chromosomes are condemned

160
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:45,949
it's either centromeres here there's

161
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:47,688
little red regions telophase and

162
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:49,968
cytokinesis is where the nuclear

163
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:52,968
membrane reforms in La reappear

164
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:55,129
chromosomes unwind into chromatin myosin

165
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:57,168
one and a pin filament rings and check

166
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,989
to cleave the cell into two that Cluj

167
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:01,698
furs were in that contracting ring is

168
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:04,068
where the cells basically starting to

169
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:08,629
kind of pinch where it's ultimately in a

170
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:11,330
brick part there so - telophase due to a

171
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,330
phase is reverse reversal prophase and

172
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:16,550
from benefits events thus completing the

173
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:19,459
cell cycle and you can see that here

174
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,819
we're now even visually seen basically

175
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:24,468
two separate and distinct cells that

176
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,419
mitosis phase could be that again that

177
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:29,629
kind of refresher of what interphase is

178
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:31,968
you could see the DNA is very hard to

179
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:34,399
see it's very thin here we're condensing

180
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:35,808
it down then you need to envelope is

181
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,199
starting to kind of break down a little

182
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:38,300
bit

183
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,259
metaphase is very distinctive if they

184
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,689
land on the plate

185
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,729
anaphase very quick time words are

186
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:44,778
separating out and here until the phase

187
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:46,668
we're starting at that cleavage furrow

188
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:50,629
so I don't get that pinch point in the

189
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:52,908
middle action path because there's five

190
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:54,110
main events occurring in Tooele phase so

191
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:55,428
well like they simplify it the hair

192
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,528
they're actually five things going on

193
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:59,118
during this one pays the daughter

194
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:01,129
chromosomes are becoming surrounding a

195
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:04,159
nuclear envelope see that here we're

196
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:07,490
starting to form that protective nucleus

197
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,959
over the DNA structure also during

198
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,829
telophase daughter chromosomes become

199
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,699
longer and thinner and become invisible

200
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:16,550
become invisible because they're

201
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:18,919
becoming from my condensed state to a

202
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,749
very relaxed state the reason why

203
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:25,308
they're getting into a relaxed state is

204
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:27,050
it makes it easier for DNA replication

205
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,939
of certain genes that may be needed by

206
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,528
the cell if everything was all condensed

207
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:32,329
and pack together be really hard to get

208
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:34,250
it DNA so that's why it becomes

209
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,198
invisible because it's becoming thinner

210
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,889
it's becoming more single-stranded and

211
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:42,348
it is a dense coil during telophase also

212
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:44,149
nucleoli become visible again a little

213
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,639
hard to see here it's the kind of the

214
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,350
nucleus within the nucleus and it's that

215
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,899
typically a little darker region very

216
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,279
evident in this cell here also

217
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,750
many of the spindle fibers beginning to

218
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,059
break apart they were needed for

219
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,860
separating out the chromosomes here but

220
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:02,139
they're starting to disintegrate and

221
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,440
basically fall apart because they're no

222
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:07,480
longer needed at this particular phase

223
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,760
lastly for talking about plant cells the

224
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,050
cell plate will form this is only for a

225
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,269
plant cell because they have a cell wall

226
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:15,309
so we're getting into that cell plate or

227
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,389
that cell wall that's forming and that's

228
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:18,669
kind of what it looks like in a real

229
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,649
life cell that is the cell plate and

230
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:22,779
that's ultimately a joint appearing form

231
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:26,679
a cell wall between these two newly

232
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:28,809
formed identical cells cytokinesis is

233
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,000
the actual separation to two independent

234
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:32,979
cells here it's very end of the mitotic

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,200
phase it's actually considered its own

236
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,980
separate phase that's when the two cells

237
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,330
actually are separating out completely

238
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,460
this is a very simple summary so

239
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,230
hopefully you can follow along with this

240
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,720
here with some of the what's going on in

241
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,019
the different phases interphase early

242
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,639
prophase late prophase metaphase is very

243
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,009
distinctive with them all being lined up

244
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,500
on the plate and then anaphase we have

245
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:59,769
here and in telophase this would be

246
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,389
followed by cytokinesis you're looking

247
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,519
for a wonderful summary slide of

248
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:07,090
everything this is the entire process

249
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:11,470
here with nice bullet points for each

250
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:14,950
also gives a wonderful images of the

251
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,660
cell how it looks with the stain and die

252
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,960
here of the immunofluorescence

253
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:22,269
microscope to get you an idea of how it

254
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,430
looks on a cartoon image showing the

255
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,769
things in detail gives you those

256
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:28,389
descriptions and in the real world image

257
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:31,299
with the bar here indicating the same

258
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:33,569
size for each so great slide to review

259
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:37,419
from tester quizzes

260
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,010
another review slide the cell cycle here

261
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,809
it specifically points out animal cells

262
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,539
because it won't have that cell plate

263
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:44,709
forming inside a thesis just another way

264
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,870
to kind of review and make sure

265
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,340
understanding and knowing all of the

266
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:54,370
steps here's a slide here showing cells

267
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,990
actively growing in a root tip wears a

268
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,970
lot of mitosis going on

269
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,620
I could easily point to one of these you

270
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,490
should be able to identify what stages

271
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:05,320
is based on digital observations so

272
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,669
let's go through some of that remember

273
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,200
in the description there

274
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,389
a link to all these slides and he had

275
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,500
the answers you're welcome to pause them

276
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,689
all I'm gonna run through these slides

277
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,830
here and go over the answers so this is

278
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,360
the first one linked to the second one

279
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:23,350
Oh Ted is put into two different cells

280
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,330
here the third one in two different

281
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:30,340
cells and again this is in a plant cell

282
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:33,610
the fourth one what phase of mitosis are

283
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,950
these two it so if you want to pause and

284
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,300
go back or look at the description for

285
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,509
the links to the slides you can look at

286
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:42,219
those more now we get to the answers so

287
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:43,509
the first one was metaphase gainer all

288
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,730
kind of lined up on that plate may not

289
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:49,210
be 100% perfect but we do see a

290
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:52,090
distinctive line form interphase in

291
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,470
anaphase here they're not lined up on

292
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,720
the plate they're getting pulled apart

293
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,920
and see that and interphase we see the

294
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,360
distinct nucleus and nucleolus prophase

295
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,159
we're starting to do that condensing and

296
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,730
anaphase again being pulled apart a

297
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:08,289
little bit more distant here Teela phase

298
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,649
for seeing that cell plate kind of

299
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:13,179
starting to form a little bit to cells

300
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,189
almost complete with their division

301
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:19,870
process and then prophase here we're

302
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:22,330
seeing the DNA being condensed here link

303
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,879
to some videos that might be helpful and

304
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,290
looking at the descriptions here and

305
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,909
you're also welcome to go back and

306
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:29,909
review the sides here thank you
