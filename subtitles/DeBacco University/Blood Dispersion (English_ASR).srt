1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,520
here when i take a brief overview of the

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,199
four main stages of blood dispersion

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,959
as it comes in contact with the surface

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,880
as it gets dispersed

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,559
and kind of the steps it goes through

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,599
between when it initially is falling

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,278
to that final result we'll see after so

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,719
phase one is contact and collapse and

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,079
phase two is the displacement so the

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,919
contact and collapse

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,839
phase it's when the droplet first hits

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,439
the target surface as you may suspect

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,278
and the droplet begins to collapse from

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
the bottom upward

15
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,518
this spot collapses the blood at the

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,520
collapsing point is forced outwards

17
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,199
creating a rim around the droplet

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,040
this is what we can measure for looking

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,920
at getting into kind of the measurement

20
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,399
of that

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,120
impact angle if it was on an angle for

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
example

23
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,839
the angle of impact and the target

24
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,359
surface will affect the boundary by

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
determining the nature of the rim and

26
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,280
the flow it falls onto

27
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
also dimension is the that target

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,558
surface

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,039
the more porous it is versus the more

30
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,759
solid

31
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,600
it may be that's going to really affect

32
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,238
how that's going to potentially go

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,399
through this

34
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,599
contact and collapse phase the

35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,439
displacement phase

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,719
the dimples are present in the

37
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,920
displacement phase

38
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,079
may result in the formation of

39
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
individual spatter or a spine

40
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,599
that could develop we kind of see that

41
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,960
spines kind of developing here

42
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,000
the target surface influence the

43
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,438
formation of the spines and shape

44
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,640
irregularities so if it's a very smooth

45
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,319
surface you might get really well

46
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,560
defined kind of

47
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,239
displacement phase if it's a very porous

48
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
surface it might be harder for it to

49
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,000
kind of

50
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,560
see that level of detail the dispersion

51
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,159
phase

52
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
is where the blood is forced into the

53
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,520
boundary the rim and dimples that rise

54
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,159
upward and opposite in the direction

55
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,879
of the original momentum so here

56
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,960
impacted

57
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,000
as coming kind of coming down and it's

58
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,078
dispersing kind of coming

59
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,599
back up a little bit the satellite

60
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,599
splatter will form to the greatest

61
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,039
extent when the impact angle is closer

62
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,640
to 90 degrees

63
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
stain striking the target surface at

64
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,280
more acute angle

65
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,118
produce wave cast off spatter where the

66
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
where the blossom effect occurs more

67
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,118
in the form of a wave on one side of the

68
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,599
rim that just makes sense if you're on

69
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,280
more of an

70
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,640
angle you're not going to get

71
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,320
necessarily this perfectly

72
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,000
symmetrical dispersion phase

73
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,598
and last one being retractions is the

74
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,719
last phase of development

75
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,799
the result from the effect of the

76
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,800
surface tension trying to pull the fluid

77
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
the stain back into a single form we

78
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
have those internal forces there trying

79
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
to pull it back

80
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
together those internal forces present

81
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,399
in the moving

82
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,239
fluid are overcome by the surface

83
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,640
tension and the liquid

84
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
reactants forming spines away from the

85
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,159
potential stain

86
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,080
a very acute angle impacts the forces of

87
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,639
inertia overcome the surface tension

88
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
and satellite spots will detach from

89
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,039
there

90
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
so just kind of gives you that very

91
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,959
brief kind of look at as we have the

92
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
kind of the end phase how you'll see it

93
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,200
in the end

94
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,799
but how would that form well this is

95
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,639
that dispersion phase

96
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,879
and this is that displacement ultimately

97
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,039
starting with that contact phase

98
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,560
all this helps you hopefully understand

99
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,878
a little bit more of what's going

100
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,598
on with blood dispersion because of the

101
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,639
properties

102
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,639
internal to the blood
