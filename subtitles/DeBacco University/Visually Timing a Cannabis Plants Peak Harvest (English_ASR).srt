1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
now if you're looking to determine the

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,480
peak harvest of your cannabis plants

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,400
this debaco university video is going to

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,440
give you three main plant components to

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,310
be looking at

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:20,240
to determining that peak harvest time

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,839
[Music]

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,159
all right let's get into visually timing

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,679
a canvas plant's peak harvest

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
now three things you should be looking

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,239
at within the plant would be the stigmas

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,719
the trichomes and the size and

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,320
development of the actual flower or bud

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,239
now each of these will be briefly

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
covered in this video however if you

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,679
want to learn about any of these

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
in more detail there'll be a separate

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,558
video that will go into showing you some

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
examples visually

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,919
as well as providing descriptions for

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,319
each of these plant parts

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,600
so those stigmas trichomes and size and

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
development all focus

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
really on that main flower and bud and

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,480
looking at some of the details

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
that look at the development of that

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,238
butter flower

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,878
so first off the stigmas so a female

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,679
part

30
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,239
of the flower is the stigma it is it is

31
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,079
sticky

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,520
where the pollen would land and start

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,280
the fertilization process

34
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,359
but our goal in cannabis is to not have

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,040
those plants be fertilized

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,040
in canvas this structure looks like kind

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
of fine white fuzzy structures

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
that kind of resemble a whisker this is

39
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,000
because there

40
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,599
this is a area that would try to go out

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
and try to like capture

42
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,959
a pollen grain that might be floating in

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,079
the air it could easily grab on and get

44
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,000
stuck into here

45
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,519
and then go through and pollinate that

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,879
said flower that's where they have those

47
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,399
like fine hair like appearance that's

48
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,839
right they're sticky so we have a random

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
pollen grain kind of floating through if

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
it was still land here

51
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,399
be stuck and go through that

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
fertilization process

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,799
another plant structure the trichomes

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,439
and this is often used as the main kind

55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
of

56
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,679
sense of is the flower ready what are

57
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,039
trichomes where they are small

58
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
mushroom-shaped glands that are

59
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,118
responsible for producing cannabinoids

60
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,719
as well as terpenes for the plant they

61
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,359
coat the surface having

62
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,840
resin provides a frontline defense

63
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,159
against

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
fungus insects and hungry herbivores so

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,680
they are a protection

66
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,438
mechanism of plants in general but they

67
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,159
also are the site of cannabinoid terpene

68
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,038
production

69
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,159
which is advantageous for cannabis

70
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,238
production

71
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,680
and lastly we have just the general bud

72
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,959
size and development

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
on a plant where there will be

74
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,598
variability in buds in the plant the

75
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
goal is to produce

76
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,079
large and dense buds consistently on a

77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,920
plant which can be influenced by a light

78
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,520
exposure to the buds this is why there's

79
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,238
different pruning strategies

80
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,400
implemented to try to maximize that bud

81
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
size development and also density

82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,439
to maximize this production uh pruning

83
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,959
styles play a role

84
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,878
in this final product particularly for

85
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,039
indoor growers that have limited or

86
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,639
direct light sources so putting them so

87
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,239
that they're exposed more of those buds

88
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,799
are exposed to the higher intensity

89
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,759
light

90
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,719
will help increase the size development

91
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,280
and density

92
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:53,039
and ultimately the quality of the final

93
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,039
product that you're producing
