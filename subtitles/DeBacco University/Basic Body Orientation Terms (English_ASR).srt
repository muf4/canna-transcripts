00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
welcome to this video on the basic body

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,240
orientation terms

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
while this might seem pretty simplistic

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
it is important to be able to understand

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,879
some of these terms and vocabulary

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,719
because if you're generating a report or

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,160
look reading an autopsy these are the

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,278
terms are going to be used

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,439
so it's important that you have an

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,519
understanding of them so these

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,600
anatomical positions

12
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,920
they're used to describe regions of the

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,480
body in common terms and vocabulary and

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,118
this is how

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
scientists can communicate easily with

16
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,000
one another

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
so that everyone has the same mental

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
image as everyone's on the same

19
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,199
page now we're looking at some of the

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,399
key terms you should be

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
familiar with well one is the superior

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,679
in the

23
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,280
inferior so at the example here the

24
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,759
superiors towards the head

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
and the inferior is towards the feet so

26
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,039
keep in mind when we're looking at

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,799
describing something or where something

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
might be progressing to

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,759
we're looking at kind of towards the

30
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,319
head or towards the feet we'd use the

31
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,000
terms

32
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,000
superior or inferior here

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
we also have terms called dorsal and

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
ventral

35
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
and dorsals towards the back and

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
ventrals towards the front so i have the

37
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,079
picture of the fish here because a lot

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
of

39
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,000
times we think of the dorsal fin which

40
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,799
is on the top here it's on the back of

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
the fish

42
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,799
the ventral side to the underside

43
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
relating this to humans

44
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
so that dorsal cavity would be kind of

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
where the backbone vertebrae

46
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,040
are and the ventral cavity is more

47
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,599
towards

48
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
the frontier where the chest and stomach

49
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,719
are located

50
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,280
so keep in mind of that dorsal and

51
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,239
ventral no matter what the orientation

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
of the organism

53
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,839
is getting to proximal and

54
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,599
distal proximal is towards the point of

55
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,000
attachment and distal away

56
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,280
from the point of attachment so when

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,478
we're looking kind of the arm the

58
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
proximal area

59
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,438
is closer uh towards the shoulder the

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,439
distal region is getting out towards

61
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,039
the hand there away from the point of

62
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,559
attachment so again this might be

63
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
important in particular of limbs looking

64
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,640
at lacerations and describing them

65
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,118
as far as where they might be located or

66
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
they might be traveling

67
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,560
then we have potentially uh discovering

68
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,359
a body might be on the

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
supine or the prone position supine's

70
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,878
laying on the

71
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,640
back side which we can see evident as

72
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,598
this person is and then prone would be

73
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,318
laying on the

74
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,878
belly side so describing how a potential

75
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,958
victim was found at a crime scene

76
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,439
these terms will often be used if the

77
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,680
victim is lying horizontally

78
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,840
then we have anterior and posterior and

79
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,239
anterior is the front side and posterior

80
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,439
is

81
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,080
the back we can see that evident here as

82
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,639
well

83
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,560
so again keeping in mind some of these

84
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,919
orientation positions

85
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
will help aid in a lot of the

86
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,919
description and then

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,959
lastly we have something called medial

88
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,318
and then we have

89
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,878
lateral so measles closer to the midline

90
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,598
of the body and laterally away from the

91
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,079
midline

92
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,878
of the body we can see that described or

93
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
shown

94
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,318
right here along with some of the other

95
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
terms that we covered so again some of

96
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,158
this is just that memorization

97
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,840
but knowing these terms will not only

98
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,079
allow you to produce

99
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,158
a quality report but read one that might

100
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,159
be generated from somebody else
