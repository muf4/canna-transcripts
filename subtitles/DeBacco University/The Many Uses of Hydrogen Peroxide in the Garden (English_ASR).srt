1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,679
and this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,899
going to go over the many uses of hybrid

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,939
peroxide in the garden which include

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,039
going over how it can help improve your

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,558
seed germination how it can utilize it

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,500
to sterilize your tools as well as

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:19,559
control potential foliar as well as soil

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,420
based diseases so come along and learn

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,879
about how this very simple product can

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,240
have multiple uses for your benefit in

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,239
your garden

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,579
[Music]

13
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:34,320
thank you

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,299
now first off we should start with

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,780
basically what is hydrogen peroxide so

16
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:42,000
it's a simple molecule H2O2 light can

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,399
break it down and basically cause the

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,920
original molecule to form into water and

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,960
oxygen in the gaseous formed there so

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,179
kind of a pretty benign end products

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,859
here water and oxygen gas this is part

22
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,058
what makes the end result so safe you

23
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,439
know we want to be careful with the

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,000
original product

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,500
so the general mode of action how does

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,420
something so simple work it's

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,179
essentially the decomposition process

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,859
releases an oxygen and produces a

29
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,200
hydroxyl free radical that damages

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,840
proteins in DNA and that's where it can

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,600
kind of help reduce the presence of

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,840
certain diseases certain bacteria

33
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,059
certain funguses and potentially even

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,159
viruses it's basically how it works

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,140
however from a user standpoint we want

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
to be aware and cautious of hydrogen

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,000
peroxide because it is does have a

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,519
strong oxidizing agent it's also a

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,200
mucous membrane irritant and can cause

40
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,179
what's called peroxide burn if you get

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,400
it on you in high concentrations it'll

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,540
literally turn your skin white if you're

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,219
applying especially higher

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,740
concentrations in closed environments

45
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,658
you will feel potential irritation on

46
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,179
your mucous membranes and if you spill

47
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,579
it anywhere if you I be advised that

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,320
it's an oxidizing agent can also be

49
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,179
corrosive

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,519
what are some of the advantages of using

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,740
this though uh then as I hinted to it

52
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,319
before it can kill both fungi and

53
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,879
bacteria as well as algae copper also

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,339
fits into this category but has many

55
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,438
other issues such as interactions with

56
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,719
other products can have photos toxicity

57
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,758
you can have long residuals can also be

58
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,500
an environmental contaminant if you're

59
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,539
adding a lot of copper fungicide

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,060
hydrogen peroxide really does not have

61
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,219
any of those negative effects so and

62
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,020
also there's no residue left behind so

63
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,580
other products you may have applied you

64
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,620
may go back after it dries on the leaves

65
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,680
and get kind of this white residue that

66
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,840
will not happen with hydrogen peroxide

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,360
however no product is perfect so here

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,520
are some disadvantages it does have a

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,800
very short residual time meaning it

70
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,180
doesn't last for very long I'm not very

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
you know light as I said breaks it down

72
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,739
so it doesn't last very long this can

73
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,680
require frequent applications and can

74
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,659
only kill what it comes in contact with

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,580
so that means if you're not getting good

76
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,919
spray coverage or good even spray

77
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,540
coverage you're not going to really see

78
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,639
the benefits as much as you would if

79
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,500
you're getting uniform consistent spray

80
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,378
coverage there and really a fine

81
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,360
coverage as well will help increase the

82
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,219
effectiveness of this product

83
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,840
now it's important to note at this point

84
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,120
that I'm not sponsored by any particular

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,459
company all products were purchased at

86
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,140
retail cost there's no sponsorship of

87
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,019
any kind and the products mentioned here

88
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,939
so keep that in mind uh that this is my

89
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,580
honest opinion based on what I've gone

90
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,139
out and purchased just like you can

91
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,180
now there are some common hydrogen

92
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,399
peroxide that is typically found to be

93
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,860
around three percent it does come

94
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,780
typically in a light block container you

95
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,819
want to avoid high heat as well as

96
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,860
shaking and it does have a shelf life

97
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,299
that will be listed on there the reason

98
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,159
why you don't want to shake it is by the

99
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,620
shaking motion of it it will cause the

100
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,539
degradation of that product which want

101
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,158
to be mindful of the shelf life and not

102
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,079
that it necessarily goes bad and will

103
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,179
cause any harm just the percentage

104
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,400
listed that three percent will start to

105
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,260
degrade and break down from there you

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,299
can also store it in a cool environment

107
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,620
that'll help prolong the life of the

108
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,299
product as well

109
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,000
there's also General concentrated

110
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,519
hydroponic hydrogen peroxide products as

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,199
I said were mentioned here in the garden

112
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,819
so these concentrated products shown

113
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,639
here even though they might be food

114
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:07,738
grade around the 10 to 35 percent and

115
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,539
they are typically found off label Pool

116
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,819
Products sterilizers or something like

117
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,679
that it is recommended that you purchase

118
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,719
a product for your intended purpose and

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,280
follow the printed label so while these

120
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,560
might be the same product if they're not

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,478
recommended for agricultural purposes

122
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,459
they're not going to be the focus here

123
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,439
even though they say food grade that's

124
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,060
for food consumption grade that's not

125
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,000
necessarily assumes that they can be

126
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,800
applied to food based on the label

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,300
so agricultural focused products are

128
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,000
going to be the ones again focused here

129
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,699
biosafe systems as product lines what

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,079
I'm going to focus on they have items

131
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,600
that you may be familiar with such as

132
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,099
xero tall oxidate sanidate and

133
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
terraclean

134
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,639
now the four main uses that I'm going to

135
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,280
dive into detail here are going to be

136
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,918
how hydrogen peroxide can help improve

137
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,319
seed germination how it can be used to

138
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,198
sterilize tools how it can be applied

139
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,779
for foliar diseases as well as soil

140
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,520
treatments for soil-borne diseases so

141
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,019
we're going to focus on these four in

142
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,339
great detail and hopefully give you some

143
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,500
specifics

144
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,198
so first off the improved seed

145
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,899
germination so soaking in plain water is

146
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,759
effective and for known difficult seeds

147
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,459
adding gibberellic acid or gas is

148
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,080
suggested however gas have a shelf life

149
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,879
can be hard to get and acquire a

150
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,459
specific PPM or parts per million

151
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,259
concentrations to really be effective

152
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:28,138
this is why some growth will suggest

153
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,419
adding kelp to the water of seeds and

154
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,519
you know are going to be soaked but this

155
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,740
is typically a random dilution with

156
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,719
inherent variability of the hormone

157
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,478
concentration so even if it does help

158
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,000
it's not really a repeatable method in

159
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,579
contrast to this using hydrogen peroxide

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,740
has been proven to increase germination

161
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,538
rates it's needed low concentrations

162
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,939
it's easy to get and can be used for

163
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:52,139
other purposes both in and out of the

164
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:54,719
growing area

165
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,759
so this is a research article here that

166
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm going to pull some data from but I

167
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,300
always like to provide the original

168
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,500
protocols so you can take a look here if

169
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,900
you wanted to know any of the

170
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,939
information this is the research data

171
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:07,379
original article I'm going to give you a

172
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,478
brief summary here

173
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,879
so the research findings again this is

174
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,219
kind of an idea of what they were

175
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,319
looking at to get to the result they

176
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,120
looked at seed sterilization germination

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,639
and ceiling development were carried out

178
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,800
in hydrogen peroxide solution at

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,900
different concentrations and in short

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,900
they found that one percent hydrogen

181
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:30,120
peroxide solution showed the fastest and

182
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,099
most efficient germination High

183
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,399
germination efficiency for very old

184
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,680
seeds with lower viability was also

185
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,060
demonstrated in their study this

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
protocol demonstrates that Superior

187
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,019
germination compared to water control

188
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,538
and reduces the risk of contamination

189
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,879
making it suitable for tissue culture

190
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,620
and other sensitive applications as well

191
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,800
as any applications you might be going

192
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,379
into such as rock wool or soil or

193
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,418
soilless media any of that this water

194
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,740
control compared to the one percent and

195
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,538
even went higher than one percent but

196
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,038
one percent was shown to be the most

197
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:03,959
effective

198
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,279
that seed soaking solution here and

199
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,439
again I'm just showing you regular

200
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,879
generic store purchased hydrogen

201
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,740
peroxide is really what I recommend here

202
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,019
the goal is to generate that one percent

203
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,180
solution uh because this is a three

204
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,000
percent solution so it's one part hydro

205
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,879
peroxide and two parts water I give you

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,500
some examples here in both ounces as

207
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,839
well as milliliters so you can

208
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,060
effectively or easily get to that one

209
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,500
percent concentration ultimate

210
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,300
concentration from that three percent

211
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,660
solution for those that want to know the

212
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,000
math behind it it's C1 V1 equals c2v2

213
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,560
where you've got concentration of the

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,240
original material and volume of the

215
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,280
original material equaling the

216
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,840
concentration and the volume of the

217
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,459
resulting material there so you can go

218
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,719
through and do your calculations as you

219
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,159
see fit

220
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,840
now I mentioned something else that

221
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,939
hydrogen peroxide can also be used to

222
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,859
sterilize tools frequent cleaning of

223
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,500
tools can help prevent the grower from

224
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,939
being a vector for disease just in

225
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,439
spreading from one plant to another

226
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,879
instead of you pruning one plant going

227
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,439
to another Or Another We're spreading

228
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,759
that disease putting your tools or

229
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,860
soaking your tools in this can help

230
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,419
reduce that chance having a small

231
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,819
container of what's called sanity

232
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,439
solution can make it easy for Growers to

233
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,960
do quick submersion of the tools they

234
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,939
are using to Simply Clean it note though

235
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,439
if viruses are the main concern milk

236
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,800
would be advised for the specific

237
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,478
purpose as the protein coat the virus

238
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,520
particles in the proteins from the milk

239
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,139
I should say coat the virus particles to

240
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,698
reduce the chance of the virus binding

241
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,538
to plant cells and this was common

242
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:32,158
practice for Planters of tobacco dipping

243
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:33,958
their hands in milk to again prevent

244
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,658
them from being vectors or spreading

245
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,838
tobacco mosaic virus

246
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:42,059
now tool sterilization solution note

247
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,339
this is not a cleaner so if the tools

248
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,859
are being used are very dirty be sure to

249
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,600
remove the other means the bulk of the

250
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,159
organic matter on that then we could see

251
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,879
that these are quote dirty tools here

252
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,338
with a lot of the soil or sand or just

253
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,200
generally organic material essentially

254
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,940
the tool should be pre-cleaned for this

255
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,220
to have maximum Effectiveness meaning

256
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,200
the hydrogen peroxide will be much

257
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,320
reduced in Effectiveness if you have

258
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,339
these dirt particles here already you

259
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,140
want to kind of clean them maybe with

260
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,880
soapy water and then follow up with a

261
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,699
peroxide treatment and you'll get the

262
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,278
most Effectiveness from that treatment

263
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,980
now the solution here um should make it

264
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,720
fresh daily once diluted the solution

265
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,580
should be used for that day or even

266
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,360
potentially less if you're doing a high

267
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,399
volume

268
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,080
if exposed to direct sunlight this will

269
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,179
speed up the degradation process as well

270
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,620
so keep that in mind essentially the

271
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,599
active ingredient will start to break

272
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,060
down and become less effective if it's

273
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,800
stored for a long period of time so just

274
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,799
as we see here we have a clear container

275
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,359
clearly some tinge to that container

276
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,620
probably these tools put in there a

277
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,120
little dirty it's going to much less

278
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,860
effect in this and if it was a light

279
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,839
block container and the tools were

280
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,000
pre-cleaned before and then dipped in

281
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,980
the sanity solution if you're using it

282
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,440
frequently for example tomato pruning

283
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,839
you may want to make a new mix of

284
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,820
solution midday to help ensure the

285
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,940
maximum and consistent sterilizing power

286
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,339
of the original solution

287
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,720
now two sterilizers with that

288
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,580
concentration what should we be looking

289
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,920
at to keep our tools not only visually

290
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,080
clean but also clean of potential

291
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,879
diseases so when cleaning tools the

292
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,379
higher end of the range can be used with

293
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,419
little threat of damage to the tool

294
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,439
plant or user so you can can favor a

295
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,379
little bit on the higher end of the

296
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,080
scale it will always look like a clear

297
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:27,720
water solution so be sure to put it in a

298
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,100
special labeled container so you and

299
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,080
others know that that is a hydrogen

300
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,060
peroxide solution at the end of the day

301
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,680
a final submersion in the solution

302
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,659
followed by a rinse can help reduce the

303
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,739
chance of corrosion of the equipment so

304
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,000
we don't want to just like leave it

305
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,080
soaking on there because it could it

306
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,120
could damage your equipment if you're

307
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,200
doing it daily and for long soaks you

308
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,940
want to just give it a quick rinse

309
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,160
afterwards hopefully keep your tools

310
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,420
nice and clean and also giving them a

311
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,458
long life

312
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:53,219
now what I recommend specifically for

313
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:56,699
this would be the sanitate 5.0 product

314
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,500
typically 1.6 to 5.4 fluid ounces of

315
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,959
this product with 5 gallons of potable

316
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,860
water typically a conversion of that

317
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:07,319
would be 47 160 milliliters to 19 liters

318
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,579
of potable water the ideal solution for

319
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,140
controlling plant and human health

320
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:12,539
pathogens on a variety of hard

321
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,759
non-porous surfaces such as floors

322
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:17,278
tables benches tools equipment restrooms

323
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,139
and more are listed and try to provide

324
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,299
you with the label here an example of

325
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,519
the product but by all means take a look

326
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,740
at this maybe in more detail and look at

327
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,659
the full extensive specimen label before

328
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,240
purchasing anything

329
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,759
now the third item that I mentioned was

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,620
foiler applications this is one of the

331
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,980
few bacteria sites that exist in general

332
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,860
but it also does work on fungus as well

333
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,778
now here's kind of a list of everything

334
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,240
that it can that's on the label for leaf

335
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:48,120
and soil based pathogens and this is for

336
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,459
zero tall 2.0 and I just kind of

337
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,720
highlighted two here Alton area a very

338
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,819
common one this is what it looks like on

339
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,920
the leaves and powdery mildew also what

340
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,500
it looks like on the leaves now again as

341
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,240
stated on the label tobacco mosaic virus

342
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,820
is listed but again if viruses are your

343
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,680
main control I think there's products

344
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,300
that are more effective but you can see

345
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,519
it's not just alternator powdery mildew

346
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,338
fuserium which we'll talk about at the

347
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,919
end anthracnose botrytis Downing mildew

348
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,079
potentially as well pythium rusts and

349
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,599
scabs so we can see a wide variety

350
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,539
listed at least on the label

351
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,180
so advantage to the foiler application

352
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,039
is that there simply is no residue this

353
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,379
reduces the chance of burning the plant

354
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,419
causing phyotoxicity be sure to follow

355
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,039
the recommended concentrations as with

356
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,078
high concentrations there can be

357
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,059
peroxide burn of the plant material if

358
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,759
you're mixing it too strong so there is

359
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:42,299
still a chance of that burning but the

360
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,679
ideal is no residues so by keeping those

361
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,879
concentrations falling there's not just

362
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,078
adding a little bit more that's what's

363
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,240
going to cause the peroxide or the

364
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,039
chance of a peroxide burn be mindful of

365
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,200
that essentially the product does break

366
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,578
down into water and oxygen gas but if

367
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,440
it's too concentrated there is that

368
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:57,958
always run that risk of that just like

369
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,639
on your hands that peroxide burn but

370
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,559
regardless this will be no residue

371
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,839
leaving your leaves nice clean and shiny

372
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,479
with no white spots or chance of

373
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,399
interactions with products applied after

374
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,379
or even before

375
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,600
now the complete coverage is really

376
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,338
important so with this and really any

377
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,620
other contact product good plant

378
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,600
coverage is very important as this has a

379
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,240
direct impact on the effectiveness of

380
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,040
the product so we could see here find a

381
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,200
medium course Very coarse or extra

382
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,480
coarse kind of sprays in the gallons per

383
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,180
acre suggested applied could also take a

384
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,200
card and kind of get an idea of your you

385
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,299
know what kind of coverage you're

386
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,639
getting investing in a good applicator

387
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,500
or applicating equipment is advised as

388
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,720
well as the applicator themselves taking

389
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,500
the time to do it properly

390
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,000
a Mr or fogger uh where aloud offers the

391
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,639
greatest coverage in a short period of

392
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,139
time that is also a very reliable and

393
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,240
repeatable process

394
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,919
hand pump mechanical spares can be used

395
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,360
but time should be used to help ensure

396
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,699
complete plant coverage which can be

397
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,500
time consuming to do properly so again

398
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,180
just keep that in mind

399
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,419
now getting into the Fuller application

400
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:05,219
solution so the recommended product

401
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:07,860
xeritol or oxidate they're both Omri

402
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,959
listed would be in this category note

403
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,360
that both of these have the same active

404
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,299
ingredients in concentrations and also

405
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:19,500
the same EPA registration numbers as we

406
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:21,599
can see right here and right here note

407
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,120
that sometimes one is approved to be

408
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,100
applied while the other may not be so

409
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,419
check your local regulations and I would

410
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,579
recommend you check them yearly because

411
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:32,099
sometimes things can change

412
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:33,778
uh for example oxidate in at least one

413
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,000
state as a restriction that no further

414
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,278
applications are allowed but xeritol

415
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,940
does not have this same restriction so

416
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:44,458
be aware of that getting the 5.0 is a

417
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,740
more concentrated version of the 2.0 and

418
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,479
you simply use less so even if you're

419
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,539
getting like for example oxidate 2.0

420
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,399
versus 5.0 be aware of that because your

421
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:54,299
dilution rates are going to change the

422
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,339
amount of product you're going to need

423
00:14:54,299 --> 00:15:00,000
to add of the 5.0 is of course going to

424
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,620
be less than the 2.0 so again just as a

425
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,620
reminder for that to reduce the chance

426
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,198
of you doing unintentional plant damage

427
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,519
now other last one mentioned here was a

428
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,078
soil treatment I'm going to give you a

429
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,360
little bit of a background on this as

430
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,458
well and as well as an in-field example

431
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
so this is where hydrogen peroxide is

432
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,439
showing greater interest and some

433
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,720
initial results are the reason for its

434
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,339
continued use some areas have strict

435
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,320
regulations on products for controlling

436
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,019
soil-based diseases and this is really

437
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,000
for good reason as these can have long

438
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,860
residuals and negative impacts on

439
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,559
non-target environments so certain

440
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,259
fumigation products well initially

441
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,059
showed some promise the kind of risk

442
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,759
reward benefit the risk the environment

443
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:44,458
it's a little bit higher than should be

444
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,939
really allowed in some cases and the

445
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:49,559
benefits were shown to be in some cases

446
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,660
variable at best

447
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,698
so the soil treatment hydrogen peroxide

448
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,039
can control a wide range of soil-based

449
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:58,379
diseases with low residual so it will

450
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,360
not have long-term negative impacts on

451
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,799
the environment it is much easier and

452
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,659
cost effective compared to steam

453
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,578
sterilization and while steam

454
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:08,578
sterilation may be the better option

455
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:11,278
it's not easy to do it is costly in both

456
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,979
labor and equipment so this offers

457
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:17,039
another alternative that might be a

458
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,539
better utilized by more people to get

459
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,759
some Effectiveness rather than doing

460
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,919
nothing if they cannot perform true

461
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,919
steam sterilization

462
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,958
so looking at the site prep here so

463
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,578
there are still some site prep to that

464
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,439
should be implemented to help improve

465
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:33,659
the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide

466
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,180
if you're going to be using utilizing it

467
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,240
as a soil drench so first off you want

468
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:40,859
to clear the crop residue

469
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,899
some can be on the surface and or

470
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,399
partially incorporated into the soil but

471
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,919
a lot of plant residue will simply

472
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,958
reduce the soil penetration so we want

473
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,399
to have it like this would be okay this

474
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,479
would be considered to be okay we don't

475
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,339
want to have like a large amount of

476
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,539
residue simply going to reduce the

477
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,639
amount of percolation you're going to

478
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,399
get

479
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,320
um so just keep that in mind the soil

480
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,059
surface should be quick or kind of rough

481
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,100
till to allow for greater percolation

482
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:07,379
into the soil profile you don't want to

483
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,519
have like a style solid locked up layer

484
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,319
there you want to kind of have it start

485
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,879
to be kind of broken up to allow that

486
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,399
water to penetrate to allow that

487
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,559
peroxide also to penetrate quickly into

488
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,298
that soil profile ideally after

489
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,740
application you should not till the soil

490
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:21,539
as this will just dilute the soil

491
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,880
clearing cleaning that you performed

492
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,259
because if you basically kill the and

493
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,120
clean up the first inch and then you go

494
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,460
to mix it up well now you've just kind

495
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,500
of reduced the amount of effectiveness

496
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,660
of that product however you can do a

497
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,339
post application until if you think the

498
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,798
main concentration of pathogen is just

499
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,240
in that very top surface I mean you can

500
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:40,379
incorporate there if that's where your

501
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,480
target is

502
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,059
soil should have some moisture to it

503
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,640
more water will be added as you drench

504
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:49,379
but this if the soil is dry this reduces

505
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,000
the water movement to the soil profile

506
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,500
if that soil is already moist the

507
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,919
capillary action will take that water

508
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,919
deeper and offer better cleaning of that

509
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,660
soil and removal of those pathogens

510
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,360
now what solution to recommend for this

511
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,580
well terraclean 5.0 this is recommended

512
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,979
as intended for outdoor soil based

513
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:10,859
applications prior to planting the rate

514
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,900
at three gallons of terraclean in 275

515
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:15,418
gallons of water over a thousand square

516
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,460
feet this produces a 300 part per

517
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,440
million solution which is the rate being

518
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,419
suggested by other growers in what seems

519
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,100
to be generally accepted so giving you

520
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,240
that kind of at least a good starting

521
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,038
point

522
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,079
now looking at some specifics to

523
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,058
remember when we're looking at a soil

524
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,740
based treatment when using terraclean

525
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,200
5.0 it's important to have everything

526
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,720
ready to go as the last step is the

527
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,700
mixing and the applying an evening

528
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,259
application is preferred to reduce the

529
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,298
UV light which will break down the

530
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,099
hydrogen peroxide as this will simply

531
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:46,139
degrade it so if you're applying it in

532
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,178
times of low light that just increases

533
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,038
the odd that it will last even just that

534
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,100
little bit longer

535
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:55,859
once you once the concentrate is mixed

536
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,599
is added and mix it well and apply it do

537
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,099
not let it sit for expand periods of

538
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,779
time because it will start to break down

539
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,918
and that's a good thing you want it to

540
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,418
break down because you want that's the

541
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,580
breakdown process and what's going to

542
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,140
allow that Effectiveness but if you kind

543
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,699
of mix it all and kind of wait and hang

544
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,679
around and have a bright sunny day

545
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,660
that's just simply going to reduce that

546
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,620
total concentration I always like to

547
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,240
think of it's kind of like you know

548
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,159
setting up for a pit stop you know you

549
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,298
come in everything's prep to go you get

550
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,220
everything ready to go and you kind of

551
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:21,660
turn it around pretty quickly because

552
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,279
that breakdown is again what you want

553
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,380
but this makes it effective but it

554
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,579
should also be occurring in the soil and

555
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,720
you don't want to be occurring in the

556
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,579
tank or where you don't have that

557
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,319
pathogen present

558
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,839
now how do you go about delivering this

559
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,178
well this can be applied via a diluted

560
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,639
in a large tank or injected the chemical

561
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,840
rejector uh the end result is

562
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,400
essentially the same so you can use a

563
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,678
diluted water tank or a chemical

564
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,440
injector it really doesn't matter the

565
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,660
same end concentration is really the

566
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,340
goal I do caution you if you are using

567
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,900
the injector system to make sure you run

568
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,399
plain water through the system when

569
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,080
you're done to reduce the chance of

570
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,240
corrosion on internal components of the

571
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,038
injector or any fittings you may have

572
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,538
the same would be advised for a tank

573
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,558
system to extrude your pump it doesn't

574
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:07,740
have that speeding up of any corrosion

575
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:10,379
so post soil treatment you can add back

576
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,940
beneficial microbes the manufacturer and

577
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,460
says these can be added only two hours

578
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,320
after the peroxide application this is

579
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,419
when the you may see some foaming of the

580
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,460
soil surface during the application when

581
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:23,100
that is basically dissipated you ideally

582
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,140
can add back your soil microbes however

583
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:27,599
giving the area an unofficial smell test

584
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,538
the microbes for in my case I did add

585
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,798
them 48 Hours post application as this

586
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:33,298
is when the distinctive hydrogen

587
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,519
peroxide smell could no longer be

588
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,558
detected and that's what I deemed it to

589
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,139
be safe to add the microbes back without

590
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:42,480
the chance of them being killed by the

591
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,460
peroxide there the manufacturer says and

592
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
it's definitely evident in the first two

593
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,220
hours there's definitely a lot of

594
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,720
reaction but I could just smell it a

595
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,120
little bit later I wasn't super rushed

596
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,519
so I did wait two days not the two hours

597
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,678
now moving on to the soil treatment in

598
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,480
the micro replenishment of the Terra

599
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,460
grow so following the manufacturer

600
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,960
recommendations Terra Grill was added to

601
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,960
the same area that was treated with the

602
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,340
Terra clean product 48 hours prior this

603
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,019
does contain allow classes and

604
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,298
beneficial microbes and was applied over

605
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,558
the same area with less water since the

606
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:12,839
soil was still saturated from the

607
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,460
original application keep in mind that

608
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,500
cold and cloudy conditions particularly

609
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,140
that of the early spring can induce

610
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,819
reduce evaporation now what the product

611
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,620
kind of looks like it's kind of a

612
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,619
powdered product you add it to water it

613
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:27,178
dilutes very well and very rapidly not

614
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,619
sure how important this step may be but

615
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,780
it was still followed based on the

616
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,899
recommendations from the manufacturer

617
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,579
and this is an Omri certified product

618
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,860
now there is soil treatment limitations

619
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,139
so this will not solve all of your

620
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:43,199
potential pathogen issues it does not

621
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,600
seem at least it does seem at least to

622
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,519
delay the onset of soil-borne diseases

623
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,798
this hydrogen peroxide treatment while

624
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,918
steam sterilization of the soil would be

625
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:55,200
the most effective the time cost and

626
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,059
labor to accomplish this is drastically

627
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,558
more than the hydrogen peroxide

628
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:59,940
treatment so again if you can still do

629
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,099
this steam sterilization that would be

630
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,019
advised but this may be prohibited for a

631
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:06,418
lot of Growers so this is offered as

632
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:08,158
another alternative

633
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,960
now how do we how does the soil

634
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,179
treatment of hydro peroxide compare to a

635
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,620
mustard cover crop well the advantage of

636
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,480
hydrogen peroxide treatment is that it

637
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,000
can be accomplished within 48 Hours of

638
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,620
removing the plant or even less if you

639
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
follow the two hours just by the

640
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,759
manufacturer could potentially all be

641
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,558
done in one single day this can help

642
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,599
allow the grower to select a soil

643
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,579
stabilizing cover crop instead of trying

644
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,038
to get a mustard crop up to flour

645
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:34,740
Incorporated sealed before getting to

646
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:36,839
the winter cover crop seeded seeded and

647
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,579
germinated in time for the end of the

648
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,699
season particularly for those growing

649
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:43,319
long long duration outdoor crops the

650
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,179
peroxide treatment followed immediately

651
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,740
with was followed I should say was

652
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,019
followed immediately with a grass seed

653
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,519
cover crop seems to be easy and

654
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,859
effective and ensures minimal soil

655
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,139
erosion and helps ensure a little bit of

656
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,479
a rotation there with a monocrop if

657
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,679
you're growing a dicot or other crop

658
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,538
there

659
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,860
now my personal experience here just to

660
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:04,019
give you a little bit of a background

661
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:05,639
here what I'm relating this to is that

662
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,558
while growing site was treated with this

663
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,840
hydrogen peroxide it did end up getting

664
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,058
lab confirmed root based view cerium

665
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,459
however I want to add a little caveat to

666
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,500
this the vine that was infected was

667
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,480
about the fifth from the end when the

668
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,220
plant was being removed all the older

669
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,579
growth and that's the growth that was

670
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,279
like original was clean on the internal

671
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:28,500
internal Vine portion as well as the

672
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,139
roots the pumpkin did develop a rot spot

673
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,960
leading to an unofficial weight but a in

674
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,940
a DQ at the way off we can see what it

675
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,740
looked like in Wade two days after

676
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,900
weighing the pumpkin was cut up we can

677
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,640
see the evidence right here and

678
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,159
expecting a rotten mess of soup on the

679
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,500
inside actually exactly the opposite was

680
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,659
observed the pumpkin was perfect on the

681
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,400
inside so no signs of raw so the seeds

682
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,799
were actually harvested and everything

683
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,640
was all great where the rat spot was was

684
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,259
an external rot not an internal rot so

685
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,538
even though there was lab diagnostic

686
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,759
serum in the portion of the plant it did

687
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:06,079
not get to the internals of the pumpkin

688
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,460
so this is a kind of sign that this

689
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,678
hydrogen peroxide treatment May

690
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,000
certainly have had some benefit we can

691
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,038
see how the leaves look during the

692
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,919
season which definitely kept them

693
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,500
healthier longer which is again another

694
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,538
positive experience

695
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,220
the looking back at the treatments we

696
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:24,720
could see here how they looked and they

697
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,419
degraded and this was the vine here that

698
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,100
was removed and because it was being set

699
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,140
to the lab where the kind of infection

700
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,939
originally started the Oddity of the

701
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,038
serum showing up on the newer growth and

702
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,659
while causing some plant issues not

703
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,119
getting into the pumpkin or really

704
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,640
traveling down the vine indicates low

705
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,019
levels of inoculum so why was there

706
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,299
fusarium and that's kind of the obvious

707
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:47,400
question that's fair to ask due to the

708
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:50,038
late season onset in the odd location

709
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,500
this is likely due to Simply missing an

710
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,079
area when performing the drench starting

711
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,859
area was small and basically caught

712
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,480
early and then isolated so be sure to

713
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:01,979
get the entire growing area when

714
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,679
performing this treatment because any

715
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,419
areas you miss could create a pocket of

716
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,159
a disease particularly soil-borne

717
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,380
disease that could spread to other

718
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,240
portions of the plant

719
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,620
now soil treatment going forward looking

720
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,140
at this you know what are my conclusions

721
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,000
based on what I've observed the plan is

722
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,159
to continue with this soil treatment to

723
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,460
reduce disease pressure while it may not

724
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,799
be 100 effective the delayed onset and

725
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,019
Mitigation Of most pressure sure makes

726
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:30,900
it more effective than many of the

727
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,519
harsher chemical options that exist and

728
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,200
I point you to this image here where the

729
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:35,940
newer growth versus the older growth the

730
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,919
older group of course had to be serum

731
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,200
first and then newer growth was still

732
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,940
healthy so again in case I found it

733
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,400
early but this again was later in this

734
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,159
season so you know to be able to support

735
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,600
over 1100 pound pumpkin definitely shows

736
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,820
that there were still some actively

737
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,980
growing plant material but I wanted to

738
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,960
remove that and take some plant out for

739
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,839
part of the study so it was interesting

740
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,819
to see where the isolation of the

741
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,558
disease actually was

742
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:03,720
so soil treatment other factors again

743
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,220
just trying to keep in mind is that this

744
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,919
is only a supplement for disease

745
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,360
mitigation plan cover crops are still an

746
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,100
important component so I want you to

747
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,778
think this is a replacement for cover

748
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,819
crops should be used in addition to

749
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,200
cover crops for many soil-based diseases

750
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,119
you want to reduce the chance of over

751
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,380
watering and excessive nitrogen

752
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,359
applications

753
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,500
so adding a lot of nitrogen fertilizing

754
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,599
over watering are going to encourage

755
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,400
Disease by you being aware of that and

756
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,619
knowing what you have that will help

757
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,740
naturally create an environment that

758
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:34,379
will allow diseases to naturally be able

759
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,579
to spread quite aggressively so keep

760
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,720
this in mind that there is a disease

761
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,939
trying to lead the host environment

762
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,100
pathogen this can be one thing to kind

763
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,960
of help reduce the amount of pathogen if

764
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:45,000
you keep up the other two and cover crop

765
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,220
and be mindful of your environmental

766
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,980
growing conditions this could be a

767
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,720
effective way to reduce the onset and

768
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,460
reduce the severity of a disease that

769
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,460
you're seeing in your crops
