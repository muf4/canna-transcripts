00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,440
and this debacle University video The

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Rack or screen drying system for

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,638
cannabis will be covered so you can have

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,780
an understanding and depth on this

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,779
particular drying method

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,100
[Music]

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,198
all right as the image shows here let's

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,900
get into Rack or screen drying system

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,640
for cannabis and the rack system we see

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,899
here the canvas is usually sitting on

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,460
screens that's why these are

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,379
interchangeable names

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,719
so first off in general the drying

14
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,399
process is critical after all the work

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,500
of growing and harvesting the goals to

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,420
maximize the quality of the end product

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,159
that's produced and while you cannot

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,500
create a high quality end product in the

19
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,299
drying process you can certainly lose

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,820
what started out as a high quality

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,899
product if not performed correctly so

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,238
you want to do everything right up to

23
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,399
this point but don't lose it at the end

24
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,779
take the time learn the drying process

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,820
in the curing process and make sure

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,579
those are done correctly so you can take

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,039
your quality cannabis Buds and turn them

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,019
into high quality dried buds

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,299
now the drying racks as I mentioned

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,460
racks are often used in more commercial

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,100
settings where there is a high volume of

32
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,719
plant material to dry in space wants to

33
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,978
be utilized efficiently want to be very

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,500
efficient with the space that you're

35
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,599
using drying racks also reduce the risk

36
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,180
of contamination to develop by ensuring

37
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,919
efficient air circulation amongst the

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,299
buds and we have another crack that can

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,400
be placed on top that's very easily

40
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,799
stackable while still able to maintain

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,780
good level of air circulation

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,759
the rack system also offers the ability

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,040
to Aid with organization in the sense

44
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,900
that same quality buds can be placed on

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,540
the same rack but it's in the same plant

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,640
but it's in the same grow it just helps

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,720
overall with the organization process

48
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,060
there

49
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,340
now the construction of the racks

50
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,920
themselves is the goal is to have an

51
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,380
efficient and repeatable system that is

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,899
standardized we see that located right

53
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,199
here very consistent rack to Rack screen

54
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,200
to screen area to area while there is no

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,540
true correct size uh there can be large

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,340
and or small and it can still be

57
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,659
efficient that's depending on the

58
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,920
dimensions of your room the amount of

59
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,959
plate material you'll be drawing at the

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,939
same time and a few other factors as

61
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,739
well however the goals are not overly

62
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,560
packed racks since airflow is an

63
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,840
important component of for the system to

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,098
operate correctly I want to make sure

65
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,500
we're having everything operate

66
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,299
efficiently in general while light

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,039
levels should be kept to a minimum the

68
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,800
rack system offers natural shading of

69
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,719
the buds as we see here but we do want

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,819
to keep these lights minimal we want to

71
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,800
keep them on for a short duration as

72
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,899
well as the intensity of those lights we

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,180
want to be very minimal because we don't

74
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,739
want to risk degrading any of the buds

75
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,659
that we may be having in the precious

76
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,878
cannabinoids or terpenes

77
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,739
now when it comes to developing your

78
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,959
rack or screen system you don't want to

79
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,959
cut Corners setting up a rack system may

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,000
come with upfront cost which after the

81
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,039
growth and production of the actual crop

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,658
there may not be a lot of money on at

83
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,699
this point in production but don't skimp

84
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:01,378
on this particular system however many

85
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,479
of the costs will not be reoccurring so

86
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:05,039
that's a good thing and properly drying

87
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,378
the final product is critical to getting

88
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,120
the best price possible so do not go for

89
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:12,120
an inferior system don't go for over

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,158
packing a system subcar materials some

91
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,500
can be very cost effective as we see

92
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,539
right here some can be more expensive

93
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,519
but easier to sterilize so just be

94
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,259
mindful of the system you're choosing

95
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,180
and make sure that you're getting one

96
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,639
that's not going to put your final crop

97
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,920
here at any sort of undue risk

98
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,839
now theoretically there is no size limit

99
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,399
with these systems while a drying rack

100
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
system there's really no size limit in

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,019
any Dimension however make sure the

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,180
entire area of the racks take up is

103
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,860
climate controlled and I put a little

104
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,379
note here this can be a challenge with

105
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,319
very tall systems to make sure the

106
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,419
lowest and the highest racks are under

107
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,738
the same conditions with minimal

108
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,079
variability you don't want to have these

109
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,099
be really wet and needs to be really dry

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,860
you want to make sure you're getting

111
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:58,619
even air circulation from the very top

112
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,480
of the drying area to also the very

113
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,120
bottom of the drying area and again

114
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,500
while no theoretical size limit the goal

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,900
here is to keep these conditions

116
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,000
consistent as possible

117
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,219
now you do want to trim the flowers so

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,199
before setting the flowers to dry some

119
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,180
care should be taken to perform at least

120
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,399
an initial rough trim to reduce the

121
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,858
space each takes up and help aid in air

122
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,659
circulation around each bud and offer

123
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,339
even drying and this is no matter what

124
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,960
system using viewing the tray system the

125
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,819
circular system the stackable system

126
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,918
that is just general good

127
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,800
recommendations there so that you have

128
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:35,899
an efficient and effective drying rack

129
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,900
or screen system for your facility
