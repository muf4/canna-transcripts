1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
okay here i want to provide a systematic

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:08,000
data-driven review concerning kobit 19

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,760
in schools now all sources provided

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
on each slide it is mentioned with

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,119
direct links also in the video

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,199
description there is a link to the

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,439
slides for easy viewing and downloading

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,278
it'll allow you access to those links

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,679
the basic summaries are children are at

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,278
reduced risk from dying from covid19

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,439
children are poor transmitters of the

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,800
virus and do not just read the headlines

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,439
look at the actual data

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,039
and research studies high coveted areas

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,960
tend to match high

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,239
population areas as well and we'll see a

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
map of that

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,199
now destin covid 19 related to age

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
well equivalent 19 does increase

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,160
directly with age what this means is the

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
older you

22
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,519
are the higher risk of death from

23
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,959
covid19

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,320
you have under the age of 14

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
and really potentially under the age of

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,000
24 the odds of death from influenza or

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,519
pneumonia are greater than

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
covid19 and what pneumonia is is

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,239
basically

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
fluid filling the air space in the lungs

31
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,320
reducing amount of oxygen that can get

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,079
to the blood

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,719
and if the oxygen becomes too low that

34
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,079
will result in death

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,319
here's just a kind of combination of

36
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,400
leading causes of death in general

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,239
broken apart by different age groups

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,680
this provides not just diseases but

39
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,438
other causes of death based on 2016 data

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,799
with the higher causes of death being

41
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,639
located at the top

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,960
lower ones at the bottom influence it

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,200
pneumonia in kind of these orange boxes

44
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:34,478
and covid19 in the blue boxes there

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,359
this is the actual cdc data website that

46
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,438
you can

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,640
provided here at this link that you can

48
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,719
go to and access

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
what it is i took this data i was able

50
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,200
to download it as an excel file

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,118
and this is what i generated directly

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,880
from that data set we just saw

53
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,959
this just makes it a little easier to

54
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,118
read and it's looking at february 1st

55
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,319
august 8th for the united states broken

56
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,718
apart by age group

57
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,239
allocating coven 19 deaths pneumonia

58
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,718
influenza in total

59
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,798
i then took this data and compiled from

60
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,438
the age of 0 to 14

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
and put the cova death pneumonia in

62
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,598
influenza deaths for comparison between

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
the ages of 25 to 24.

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,719
and in both of these age groups is your

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
typical school age

66
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,159
children pneumonia is of greater risk of

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,439
death for people under

68
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:23,919
24 years old based on the cdc data

69
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,239
looking here at uh data from the

70
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,079
american academy of pediatrics

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,719
they stated at this time it appears that

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
severe illnesses due to coven 19 is rare

73
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,239
among children

74
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,598
and they have some information current

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,800
as of august 13

76
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,759
2020 here what is interesting of note is

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
that children were

78
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,399
zero percent to 0.4 percent of all covet

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,959
19 deaths

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,519
and 20 states reported zero child deaths

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
taking this information um the

82
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
definition of a child

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
does vary by state so it makes it a

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,439
little hard to do some comparisons

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,439
however the greatest age range for the

86
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,719
definition of a child is tennessee in

87
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,039
south carolina

88
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,800
and they state from between 0 and 20

89
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,359
years old is a child

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
however using the cdc data that i showed

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
i'm going to

92
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,280
add in from 0 to 24 and consider that a

93
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,719
child

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
which technically is going to overstate

95
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,400
cases or deaths but it's going to be

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,318
used for the comparison here

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
well the cumulative child cases is four

98
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,679
hundred and six thousand

99
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,039
one hundred and nine total child deaths

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
and again i'm dividing the child is from

101
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,560
zero to twenty four

102
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,479
would be two hundred and ninety one the

103
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,239
child mortality percentage is

104
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,518
zero 0.07166

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,239
and if we look at the united states

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,158
cases versus mortality percentage

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
based on john hopkins university

108
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,519
presented by cnn

109
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,079
you're looking at that math comes out to

110
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,360
3.135 percent

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,719
so you can see the child mortality

112
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,720
percentage is much reduced

113
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,239
now what about risk to teachers since we

114
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,199
are talking about schools

115
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,120
for those that have to work with

116
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,518
students and the concern is the ability

117
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
to

118
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,759
contract copin 19 from students while

119
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,318
the students may be at low risk of cover

120
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,798
19

121
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,878
what about students ability to transmit

122
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,000
the virus that's a great question

123
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,840
the possibility of carriers and at-risk

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,799
populations comes down to the degree of

125
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
transmissibility children have been

126
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,560
shown to be poor

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,478
transmitters of covid19 and we're

128
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,519
looking at the data provided here and

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,758
source down here

130
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,079
what does this data actually show so to

131
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
what extent do children transmit the

132
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,639
covid19 virus that's a great question

133
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,199
the evidence to date suggests children

134
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,439
spread

135
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
sars coveted v2 which is the copen19

136
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,800
virus relatively rarely

137
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,079
and that children are usually infected

138
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,478
by symptomatic

139
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,199
or presymptomatic adults in the first 48

140
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,918
hours

141
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,680
before they become symptomatic in

142
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,319
conclusion based on the study here

143
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,400
the available evidence to date suggests

144
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,079
that children are unlikely to be major

145
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,439
transmitters of sars

146
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:58,560
cov2 or the coronavirus this causes

147
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,879
causes covid 19. and again there's the

148
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
citation the links and everything

149
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,600
provided there for you

150
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,559
so what about an article like this that

151
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
was uh in

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,839
in the news if you're at this age you're

153
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,839
most likely to infect loved ones with

154
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,000
coven 19 and i provided

155
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,959
the kind of quotation here from this

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
article

157
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,519
what is they quote the emerging

158
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,038
infectious diseases and i went to that

159
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,639
source and you can see that here

160
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,719
so up at the top here is the link

161
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
provided to the best life article and

162
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
then down here is the link to the actual

163
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,478
study

164
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,719
well the age groups and this is the data

165
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,159
table too their age groups are

166
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,320
consistent every nine years which is

167
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,120
great to see if you look at the numbers

168
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,478
of contexts in which the percentages are

169
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,319
calculated from because this study is

170
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,199
focusing on percents

171
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,038
well in the 10 to 19 age group it's

172
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,000
based on 231

173
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,959
participants however the next age group

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,560
up the 20

175
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,599
to 29 age group is based on 3 3417

176
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
participants

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
so while it's great to compare

178
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,520
percentages does this really make a fair

179
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,439
comparison when there's a

180
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,159
14.79 fold increase in participants

181
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,918
between the two

182
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
age groups this is why it's important

183
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,719
again to look at the data

184
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,680
instead of just quoting percentages

185
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,120
where did those numbers come from

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
and what could be contributing to why

187
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,399
children are such poor transmitters

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,400
so we mentioned before they're poor

189
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,318
transmitters well why would this be

190
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,038
what's the potential explanation for

191
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,800
this

192
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,079
and some highlights here provided in

193
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,240
this study are that

194
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,519
asymptomatic non-coughing people realist

195
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,840
release less virus

196
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,560
loaded aerosols to begin with children

197
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,758
have less

198
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,199
alveoli and terminal bronchioles where

199
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
breast droplets are formed

200
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,240
and those are interior components of the

201
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,638
lung we kind of see them here they look

202
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
like

203
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
a cluster of grapes and they create a

204
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,360
high surface area to allow gas exchange

205
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,960
but children have less of them children

206
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,199
also have lower respiratory

207
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,399
minute volume and tend to have lower

208
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,240
viral loads

209
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,478
all this combined can explain why

210
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,759
children are poor covid19

211
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,680
virus spreaders now

212
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
when we're looking at confirmed cova-19

213
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,639
cases in the united states we often see

214
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
maps that look like

215
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,120
this and while maps like this look clean

216
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,439
and are easy to read

217
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,038
the stage borders are man made however

218
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,839
this isn't easy recognizable

219
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,000
and doesn't and does trans translate the

220
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,719
state by state data into a visual very

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,399
easily

222
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
however a more accurate description than

223
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,478
this we're looking at actual borders and

224
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,759
uh changes would be something that looks

225
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,839
more like this

226
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,120
and what this is is above me is the

227
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,598
tracking of covid

228
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
um 19 cases in the united states you see

229
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,918
all the bubbles

230
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,840
uh the bigger the bubble the more cases

231
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,318
but we also see in comparison i pulled

232
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,279
the 2016 u.s population

233
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,240
we see a lot of similarities indicating

234
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,839
that where we're finding a lot of

235
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,680
coveted cases are simply where there's a

236
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,079
lot of population

237
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,680
if we pick one area out in particular

238
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,399
the hawaiian island

239
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
of wahoo we're looking at the increased

240
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,279
population

241
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
well sure enough of comparison to the

242
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,239
other hawaiian islands

243
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,160
it has increased coven 19 cases so again

244
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,038
just take this into comparison when

245
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,400
you're looking at

246
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,240
states that look like this for example

247
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,959
montana looks really

248
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,519
large here as it's a very large area in

249
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,399
state

250
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,719
but relatively low population compared

251
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,638
to

252
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
other areas such as california or the

253
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
northeast where states might be small

254
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,400
but very population dense

255
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,239
in the united states people are living

256
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,560
longer and this is a positive but in

257
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,120
regards to coven 19 it does mean more

258
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,598
people

259
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
will be in the increased risk category

260
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,120
we see the demographics here of male and

261
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,639
female in the shift over time

262
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,719
comparing the census data from the year

263
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,199
2000 to 2010.

264
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,959
now if you look at desk by cause in the

265
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
world in 2017

266
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,598
i'm not going to bore you with all the

267
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,000
details here but you can see clearly

268
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,320
cardiovascular diseases is number one

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,440
respiratory disease is very high and

270
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
that concludes

271
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,560
and breaks out lower respiratory

272
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
infections as well

273
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,000
being very high normally and cova 19

274
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
falls into that category

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
of being a respiratory disease so

276
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,720
they're naturally high

277
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,720
and this is looking again at 2017 data

278
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,759
what's interesting of note is malaria

279
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,120
619

280
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,679
over 619 000 deaths in the world in

281
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,159
2017. now probably didn't hear a lot

282
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,519
about this

283
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,120
particularly the united states because

284
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,560
there's only about five deaths reported

285
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,919
annually in the united states mostly

286
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,039
from return travelers

287
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,319
with only about 1 500 cases so it's

288
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,278
important to remember we have to think

289
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,959
about things in a worldwide perspective

290
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,480
and if there's things that can be

291
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,439
resources that can be applied to

292
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
potentially cure

293
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,200
or definitely reduce the risk or death

294
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,399
rate of certain issues

295
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,640
that is definitely something that should

296
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,399
be considered keep in mind that malaria

297
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,120
is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a

298
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
parasite

299
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
so a little different than covid19 but

300
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,519
again we must be thinking

301
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,759
about more than just one single country

302
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,320
we must be looking at the entire world

303
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,799
and where can we try to make reductions

304
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
in

305
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,838
causes of death
