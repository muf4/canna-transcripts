1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,200
we're going to go over soil test report

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,169
target values

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:14,920
to get you an idea of what this actually

5
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:16,399
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,079
means

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,759
so if you've got a soil test report back

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,639
you might see this kind of green area

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,039
here

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
that is usually your target area some

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,439
people call it some labs we'll call it

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
medium some will call

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,118
optimum but that's kind of the target we

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,480
don't want to be up here and we'll

15
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,599
explain why you don't want to be over

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
that or under that

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,759
why that's the goal area to be well the

18
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,238
goal as i said there

19
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,320
is to be in the optimum area so some

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,519
growers think excessive is the target

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,280
but this is false optimum is the best

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,440
having excess amounts of certain

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,000
nutrients can impact the availability of

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,920
others and result in reduced growth

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,039
balanced nutrients allow for the optimum

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,559
growth of a plant

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
now the example or picture here of a

28
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,198
mountain if you think about climbing up

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,159
the mountain you're getting more and

30
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,000
more yields

31
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,279
people think it's going to go on forever

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,799
but if you keep going

33
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,320
reach that optimal or that peak that's

34
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,759
where you want to be but if you keep

35
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,478
walking you're going to go down this

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
other way

37
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,679
and start to reduce your yields when you

38
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,840
get into toxicities or

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,520
conflicting levels with other nutrients

40
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
so common misconception here if you look

41
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,798
at this nice

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
graph here i think it helps explain this

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,479
the sense that if there are more

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,159
nutrients than the plant needs

45
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,599
it can just take what it needs and

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
that's a false statement

47
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,798
now this is a common misconception that

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
growers just want to like i'll give it

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
some more and it doesn't need that much

50
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,079
it'll just ignore that and plants really

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
don't have that option

52
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,759
plants are not a kind of buffet nutrient

53
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
concentrations they

54
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
impact many chemicals reactions over

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
adding

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
what will offset this balance so also

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,118
too much

58
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,799
nutrients can cause potential

59
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,239
environmental contamination

60
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,759
not to mention wasted time and money

61
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,519
so it's not just kind of like ah give it

62
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
a bunch of nutrients a buffet and it'll

63
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,798
kind of like pick out what it needs

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,718
now you want to be fertilizing your

65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
crops and your plants to be in this

66
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,158
optimum range

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
if you go in this above optimum range

68
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,600
well you're not getting any more yield

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
you're wasting time you're wasting money

70
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,079
and potentially you could be reducing

71
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,318
yields

72
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
and also increasing the odds of

73
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,439
environmental contamination

74
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,440
all not good things so adding more

75
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,039
and getting less i kind of like this

76
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,318
general concept i think this graph kind

77
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,000
of shows it for

78
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,598
when you're adding over adding

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
fertilizer can have

80
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,479
detrimental impacts in addition to just

81
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
increasing cost to the grower

82
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,679
it also increases the chance for

83
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,239
environmental contamination and

84
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
can also reduce yields and here we see

85
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,120
the soil test

86
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,759
levels and the theoretical yields and we

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
see very low low medium high here

88
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,439
going through we're getting to that kind

89
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,958
of maximum yield this is we're applying

90
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,639
maintenance fertilizer basically we're

91
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
fertilizing the plants with the plants

92
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,199
are removing

93
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,560
previous to this stage we're kind of

94
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,079
adding a little bit more than the plants

95
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,039
can uptake because we're trying to

96
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
build up that concentration in the soil

97
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,878
however

98
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,199
then we get to a point we want to apply

99
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,639
no fertilizer if we go much beyond that

100
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,399
to the excessive range

101
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,318
well we start to get detrimental effects

102
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
we start to get toxicity issues we start

103
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,238
to get reduction in yield

104
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,158
for adding more fertilizer so again this

105
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
optimum rate is what makes growing a

106
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,878
little bit of a challenge in the sense

107
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,239
how close can you be

108
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,840
within that range lastly the target

109
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,039
should be the critical level

110
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
so you might hear gross talk about

111
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,000
critical level and this is basically

112
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
indicated here

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,318
and also generally basically right here

114
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,479
the critical level is the level at which

115
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,798
adding more fertilizer will not increase

116
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,639
yield at that point you've now crossed

117
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,040
over the sterile test value going above

118
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,878
that

119
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
you're not going to get any more yield

120
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,399
now the optimum range

121
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,239
is a range not a number the critical

122
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,158
level is more so a number

123
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
the optimum range here will be a little

124
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,079
bit above that critical level and just

125
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,239
in case

126
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
you can overshoot by a little bit that's

127
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,519
fine but if you get above optimum one

128
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,598
i've overshot

129
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,438
too far and if you get excessive you

130
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,039
could get into toxicity levels so again

131
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,000
there's this optimum range where you're

132
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,039
basically

133
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,639
applying maintenance fertilizer you're

134
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,239
if you get into that kind of above

135
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,839
optimum you're applying no fertilizer

136
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,959
because you just have excessive amounts

137
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
of nutrients

138
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,799
so it's important for growers to realize

139
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
when they're at the very low low and

140
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,000
medium categories adding more fertilizer

141
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
will increase their yields

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
but it's not a linear line forever once

143
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
you reach that critical soil target

144
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
level

145
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
getting the optimum range you're then

146
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
shifting to only applying maintenance

147
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
fertilizer

148
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,639
keep realizing at the rate you were

149
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,280
you'll get into that very high toxicity

150
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,519
levels

151
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,439
and potentially reduce your yields and

152
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,758
potentially contaminate the environment

153
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,879
both negative things you can avoid by

154
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,400
realizing and

155
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,399
knowing these target levels
