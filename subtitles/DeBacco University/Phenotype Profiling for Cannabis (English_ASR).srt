1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
in this tobacco university video we'll

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,959
be looking at phenotype profiling

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,480
related to cannabis and again phenotype

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
is how something physically looks

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,880
it's morphology how it looks to us when

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,079
it's growing as a plant

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,160
so that pheno hunting in general phenos

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,358
types are based on physical or visual

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,199
characteristics

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
this it is important to remember that

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,400
these traits can be influenced by the

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,439
environmental conditions the plant is

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,439
exposed to

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,518
so they can potentially change a plant's

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,240
phenotype based on what environment it's

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,159
growing

17
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,280
as a result documentation is important

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,439
for growing in general

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
but needs to include some extra details

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,280
when it comes to being applied to the

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,759
process

22
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
of pheno hunting growers should be extra

23
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,920
careful

24
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,839
take redundancies take as many pictures

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
and document as many

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
potential variables that they can to be

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,000
able to allow that screening process to

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,519
occur very efficiently

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,198
now we're going through and making that

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
selection well the greater number of

31
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,519
plants

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,359
grown makes it easier to find the

33
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,399
genetic standout if you're growing two

34
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,440
plants it's going to be really hard to

35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,558
kind of phenol hunt

36
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,118
if you're growing 10 100 and 1 000 10

37
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,519
000

38
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,400
to be much easier as you get more plants

39
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,319
because then you can

40
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
likely see one that might be a true

41
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,559
genetic standout

42
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,118
because the goal is to be able to

43
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,478
recognize the differences and the amount

44
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,239
of plants that you have grown

45
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,840
this may be easy if you're looking for a

46
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,640
taller plant or one with greater

47
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,719
branching

48
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,239
but may be more challenging if you're

49
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,759
looking at chemical profiles to be

50
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,559
targeted and again this can be a form of

51
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,920
phenol hunting

52
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
but might be a little bit more difficult

53
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
because you can't just look out over a

54
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,519
whole grove of plants and see oh one's

55
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
genetically taller

56
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,478
maybe that's what i'm looking for once

57
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
maybe shorter what i'm looking for the

58
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,799
chemical profiles still can be done

59
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
but a little bit more complicated so the

60
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,360
overall goal

61
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,879
of funeral hunting in general is to

62
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,078
select a few individual plants with the

63
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,000
quote best traits

64
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,399
and continue to grow and propagate these

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,519
select few i put best in quotes because

66
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,599
that's going to relate to

67
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,640
what grow the grower is deeming

68
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,478
desirable

69
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,560
you want to continue to select the best

70
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,000
of the best by calling out or removing

71
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,680
those plants that do not fit the

72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,438
intended breeding target and again that

73
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,399
breeding target may vary

74
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,239
based on different growers so that

75
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,479
phenotype selection process

76
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,758
well the selection process will take

77
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
time and does require

78
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,799
long-term dedication and careful

79
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,080
attention to detail

80
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
taking clones from the selected

81
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
phenotype is the first step

82
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,719
growing these out and then making

83
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
another selection process will reduce

84
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,000
the total

85
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
number of options in this example only

86
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
physical characteristics are determined

87
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,759
in the selection process

88
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,280
the final phenotype will at least

89
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,639
ideally have the greatest amount of

90
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,919
desirable plant habits

91
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,919
or products or whatever kind of

92
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,518
traits the grower is looking for the

93
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,559
amount of generations this takes is up

94
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,400
to the grower and

95
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
refinement of the selected traits some

96
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
might be done in a fewer generations so

97
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,840
might take more generations

98
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,519
this can be bred into another best of

99
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,319
the best selection or grown out to

100
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,080
increase the population of the selection

101
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,359
particular phenotype so again it's

102
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
important to keep in mind we see here

103
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
original phenotypes we have a whole

104
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,359
bunch listed

105
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
we have those first generation clones we

106
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
have the second generation clones and

107
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,318
then we have the final phenotype

108
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,000
so here we can see the og k5 you can

109
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,079
trace that lineage back

110
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
that was one of the many they made to

111
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
this first generation second generation

112
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
also it was the final generation

113
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,200
however i'll say this might be a little

114
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,479
misleading simply because it will often

115
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,439
take more than just two or three

116
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,318
generations

117
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,280
to get that one unique kind of selection

118
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,079
for a process

119
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
so just be mindful know what you're

120
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
looking for

121
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,599
importance of documentation so that

122
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,080
you're able to be efficient

123
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,318
with your selection process as possible

124
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,000
in hopes that you can get that final

125
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,399
unique phenotype you might be looking

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
for
