1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
okay here we're looking at the animal

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,480
phylum Analia and i little wait try to

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:08,730
get you to pronounce the word properly

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,010
and if you recognize this picture this

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,620
is the phylum that the earthworm falls

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,388
under so what's key about this

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,788
particular phylum well it's the rise of

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,320
segmentation so this is kind of in the

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,179
early innovations of the body plan of

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,028
her sila mates segmentation is one of

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,460
those key factors this is the first kind

12
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,099
of Philemon shows this as an

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,299
evolutionary kind of stuff the basic

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,939
body plan of a annelid is that the tube

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,250
within a tube concept so the the

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,189
digestive tract is suspended within the

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,659
tube of the seal so we see a tube within

18
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,899
a tube and this actually holds true for

19
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:48,929
us our intestines and our digestive

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,820
system is a tube within our body cavity

21
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,899
so that's where the term tube within a

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,759
tube comes into play

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,679
now I'm not going to require for at

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,589
least my class all in knowing of all the

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,119
individual identifications here but it

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,350
could be helpful if we do do a

27
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:07,789
dissection of an earthworm kind of the

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:10,739
outside view here and layers

29
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,430
segmentation there's three key body plan

30
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,048
characteristics one is repeated segments

31
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,299
one can be specialized segments and

32
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,310
would be these connections so each of

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,720
these plays a role when we talk about

34
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,329
segmentation of a particular animal so

35
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,368
worm reproduction they're very important

36
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,469
for soil health they pull organic matter

37
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:34,259
carbon based typically into the soil

38
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,900
mixing the material worms have both male

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,150
and female reproductive organs and this

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,618
column is the main assumption to store

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,689
the eggs of the worm that's located

42
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,640
right here so that's I could tell I'm

43
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,529
right there this earthworms meeting

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,060
mom's kind of a rare sight to see

45
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,430
they're very sensitive to ground

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,659
movement and if you're walking very

47
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,399
heavily on the ground

48
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,049
although these worms are very quick

49
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,359
about going back down into the burrows

50
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,649
below ground where you won't see them we

51
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,269
want to learn more about how earthward

52
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,478
reproduce is a great youtube video link

53
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,519
provided here there's might be a little

54
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,468
bit shocker of an image probably

55
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,389
expecting this but if again we do that

56
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:12,419
earthworm dissection this is another

57
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,679
great way to do it or if you're not

58
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,119
fortunate enough to be able to take my

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,830
class

60
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,650
experience it for yourself this is

61
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,170
another video linked here 21 minutes of

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,110
an earthworm dissection so hopefully

63
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:28,889
find that interesting be a little bit

64
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,290
longer than this video here few features

65
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,548
here segments within a long body it's

66
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:34,769
covered with mucus to help conserve

67
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,090
water and we are terrestrial base these

68
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:38,189
animals need to find a way to conserve

69
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,378
water they have the presence of both a

70
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,848
mouth and anus they have stitch hair

71
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,370
called bristles that aydin's our

72
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:46,589
movement through the soil calmly our

73
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:52,200
method i'ts meaning each individual

74
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,759
carries both male and female organs firm

75
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,469
anatomy again remember earthworms

76
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,108
accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil

77
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:59,609
plant system this is the head region the

78
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:02,400
mouth region this is where they're first

79
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:03,569
taking in some of that food and passing

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,120
it through that tube within a tube

81
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:08,158
concept and I'm not gonna be requiring

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,500
to know all the individual parts just

83
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,239
realize the heart yes that is plural and

84
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,189
will many lines they have more than one

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,378
heart there and passing and helping

86
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:18,239
their circulatory system along so just

87
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,969
because they're more primitive doesn't

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,789
necessarily mean that they contain less

89
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:25,889
organs and we have you could see example

90
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:29,489
of hearts with it being plural there's

91
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,409
more than one if you've been following

92
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,389
on some the other videos this is kind of

93
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,948
is that quick summary do you know what

94
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,049
distinguishes these three particular

95
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,810
phylum apart from one another what

96
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,280
similarities they may have just kind of

97
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,680
that quick little review slide for that

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,359
quick comparison can be able to separate

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,620
these three different phylum if not

100
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,620
there's videos in each
