1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
okay here were a look at some in season

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,359
care options for squash I never see a

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,830
cucumber rubber firm that I visited and

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,900
we see these they're not only

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,759
suppressing weeds within the row but

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,039
also in between the rows where these

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,199
vines are about to run to help reduce

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:20,009
soil splashes over the fruit to reduce

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,890
cleaning time spent scrubbing so this is

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,359
something worth consideration now the

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,500
first part we want to consider when

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,689
we're looking at squash this almost

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,570
happens before the in season part is to

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,939
trigger space in your squash properly

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,670
depending on the variety they'll hear

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,709
terms like vine semi vine contact I and

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,689
semi Bush and Bush used and this gives

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,820
some suggestions on how far they should

19
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,250
be spaced both in the row and also

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,308
between rows this is the first kind of

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,170
step to ensuring that all everything may

22
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:51,628
initially kind of end and run together

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,989
they're not having a lot of overlap so

24
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:56,308
which can create a lot of disease issues

25
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:58,049
speaking of that weed control growing on

26
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:00,149
fabric is good for winter squash to

27
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,909
reduce soil splash on the fruit see that

28
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,439
here in particular melon crops also in

29
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,298
row weed suppression if some kind is

30
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,639
recommended seem to hang them down here

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,490
but also considering in between that row

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,319
weed block there as some benefits can

33
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,478
the cost be justified some growers will

34
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,839
say yes or as well say no but keep in

35
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,069
mind your time in the ease of harvest it

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,320
makes it really easy when there's no

37
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,618
weeds in between here also plant cleanup

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,269
becomes a lot easier irrigation so

39
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,400
within overall weed suppression

40
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,989
irrigation can also be considered we see

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,630
drip irrigation being the most obvious

42
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:36,149
choice overhead can be used and act as

43
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,679
kind of a panic backup it can also

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,259
increase powdery mildew if it's not

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,600
timed well you're gonna arrogate with

46
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,159
overhead irrigation actually in the

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,449
morning with heavy dew is probably a

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,829
good time because the leaves will

49
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,570
already be wet however once established

50
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:53,158
often the need for irrigation can be

51
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,929
reduced in squash in general

52
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,790
you're looking at this especially that

53
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,030
early on to get those plants and those

54
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,280
roots established well especially if

55
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,920
you're planting successive crops and you

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,149
want to have periods of high heat and

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,550
want to ensure that they're able to

58
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,080
survive and get established before

59
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,790
they're able to have a sufficient root

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,360
system to scavenge for water by

61
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:14,359
themselves
