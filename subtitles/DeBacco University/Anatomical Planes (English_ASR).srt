1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,919
okay here I'm gonna go over some of the

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,750
anatomical planes of the body now it

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,669
won't take very long to go over but this

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,800
is something you should be reviewing and

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,539
be able to recognize each of these it's

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,700
very important especially when we get to

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,169
dissections see all these different

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,910
planes here on these different horses

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,550
right now it just looks like a bunch of

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,259
plates each of these has this particular

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,350
name and hopefully by the end of this

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,789
you'll be able to identify those so

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,830
starting first with just general

14
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,109
anatomical planes and just anatomical

15
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,089
orientation we have the dorsal side of

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,239
the horse which is the back the ventral

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,309
which is typically the stomach region

18
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:41,250
distal you see the hooves are distal and

19
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:42,229
proximal would be closer to the mid

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,149
section

21
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:47,699
cranial is towards the head caudal is

22
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,049
towards the back so distal we're saying

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,809
something is distal it's further away

24
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:55,259
from the midpoint proximal would be

25
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:57,328
closer to that particular midpoint just

26
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,219
a little bit way kind of identifying and

27
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,710
breaking something else apart here we

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,239
see our planes are coming in now so we

29
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,640
have our dorsal plane or transverse

30
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,069
plane still cranial is still towards the

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,049
head caudal still towards the back the

32
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,048
dorsal side of the tails the backside

33
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,180
the ventral is the underside you can see

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,250
our caudal towards the back cranial

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,009
towards the head all of this still holds

36
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,560
true despite where you may be on the

37
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,299
animal and the neck region the dorsal

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,060
again is the back and ventral would be

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,220
kind of the underside region here this

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,269
light gray area here that looks like

41
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,618
it's kind of highlighting the whole

42
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,599
thing that's actually the sagittal plane

43
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:38,009
so looking at this the brain into the

44
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,129
three different planes we have the

45
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,469
frontal plane which is represented by

46
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:45,719
this pane right here this kind of plane

47
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,640
right here this sagittal plane which is

48
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,310
here dividing it right down the center

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,228
and then our transverse plane which is

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,118
this kind of region right here and how

51
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,399
the brain might look these are some of

52
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,659
our sectional planes you should be

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,478
familiar with these not just in the

54
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,689
brain but in any sort of specimen in

55
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,578
general because they all hold true again

56
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,019
conveying it to a human might make a

57
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:08,758
little bit more sense we have our

58
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,978
transverse it's basically cutting the

59
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,839
body right and half almost in this case

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,560
here but on this particular plane

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,590
seeing it dividing it crossways then we

62
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,930
have a coronal plane here which is that

63
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,348
kind of more vertical and still the

64
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,360
width of the body here and then the last

65
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:30,518
one here and kind of the purpley blue

66
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,019
would be the sagittal plane and that'd

67
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,129
be kind of almost in this case right

68
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:38,680
down the middle region here putting

69
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,310
those just in three different ways to

70
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,810
look at it

71
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,580
our sagittal plane our transverse plane

72
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,039
and our coronal plane here try to show

73
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,510
in different colors different areas to

74
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,699
point to they all are basically

75
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:54,399
representing and showing the same planes

76
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:55,810
of the body but one might make a little

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,150
bit more sense to you one might be

78
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,580
easier to understand so pick whichever

79
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,620
one is most helpful to you and try to

80
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,269
learn that one and as a way to test

81
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,450
yourself to go back to the beginning

82
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,219
slide the title slide here hopefully you

83
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:12,399
can identify what some of these planes

84
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:15,090
are in the body and also regions of the

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,090
model horse
