1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
here we're gonna be looking at light and

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,970
its impact on total synthesis in the

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,730
preached manner however if you ever look

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:11,279
at the leaf really close and kind of add

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,710
some light to it you can see the intense

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,559
Network that's occurring in that leaf a

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,359
lot of exchanges going through a lot of

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,379
water can be moved through nutrients are

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,510
being produced

10
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,849
I'm shuffled across sugars are being

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,580
transported there's a lot going on in

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,410
the leaf that you may not realize now

13
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,848
those leaves contain plant pigments and

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,800
plants contain pigments that target

15
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,960
specific wavelengths of light to absorb

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,058
this allows from multiple wavelengths to

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,710
be utilized by the plant so even though

18
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,078
we typically associate leaf being

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,270
completely green there are other

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,128
pigments that do exist however

21
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,230
chlorophylls the most dominant can

22
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,329
overshadow and allow us not to see these

23
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,729
other pigments however in the case of

24
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,980
New England where leaves will fall off

25
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,419
the trees this cloth will be broken down

26
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,209
and we can start to see different

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,399
colorations develop as those pigments

28
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,289
become more prominent so they're always

29
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,698
in the leaf but because chlorophyll so

30
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,829
dominant we don't get to see them and

31
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,149
this is kind of that example here you

32
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:07,859
can see the chlorophyll being pulled out

33
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,810
of leaf margins we can see nice

34
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,900
brilliant oranges and reds and some

35
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,509
yellows being the next most dominant

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,799
pigment now chlorophyll are using this

37
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,650
as a general term is actually

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,600
chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b reason

39
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,400
why a plant has those is they absorb

40
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,859
different wavelengths so you can see

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,290
both chlorophyll a and B are pretty poor

42
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,609
at absorbing green wavelengths it's kind

43
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,960
of what makes plants green we see that

44
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,359
light being reflected

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,908
however blue and red wavelengths are

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,159
being absorbed when those chlorophyll b

47
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,900
and a have this spike here in that blue

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,590
wavelength with chlorophyll b being a

49
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:47,368
little bit more absorbent of those have

50
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,020
upper 400 nanometer wavelength we see

51
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:50,280
the contrast here chlorophyll a being a

52
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,569
little bit better to absorb those

53
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,399
mid-to-upper 600 nanometer wavelengths

54
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:58,408
this is what helps the plant you utilize

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,500
and capture more of the lignin it's

56
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,509
being exposed to to help it even further

57
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,799
along that they notice too much detail

58
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,590
there's something called antenna complex

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,810
and light energy is absorbed by this

60
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,420
antenna pigment molecules is transferred

61
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,800
ultimate to chlorophyll a reaching the

62
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,299
center pigment to drive

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,670
photosynthesis so here's chlorophyll a

64
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,469
but we could notice his energy transfer

65
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:20,849
we might be familiar with lycopene and

66
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:22,979
tomatoes that's because it kind of the

67
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,650
red color here we see chlorophyll be

68
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,659
absorbing that 650 nanometers

69
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:33,090
here's chlorophyll be also absorbing at

70
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:35,490
450 nanometers and Simon is for an 80 it

71
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,469
see this is the way that the plants able

72
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,570
to capture a greater amount of the light

73
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,419
energy and transfer that energy to

74
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:45,120
chlorophyll a - then continue on with

75
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,159
the photosynthetic process by utilizing

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,700
as much energy as possible that's being

77
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,699
exposed
