1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
this is going to be a basic sensory

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:06,230
system overview and the reason why I

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,480
chose the picture of the baby here is

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,429
trying to explore the world around us we

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,710
typically use our sensory system to be

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,599
able to perceive things and this is how

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,060
we go about learning about that out what

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,060
things touch taste look like and so on

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:24,028
and so forth so the sensory perception

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,679
the sensory nervous system tells a

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:27,570
central nervous system what's happening

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,210
what's going on what are we being

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,278
exposed to as a result we have sensory

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,799
receptors which are special specialized

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,620
sensory cells that detect changes inside

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,119
as well as outside the body so as much

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,829
as we were trying to detect you know

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,259
what color things are on the outside

19
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,670
most one has sensories on the inside of

20
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,189
our body they'll help us tell our

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,410
internal environment we have sensory

22
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,570
organs that are complex sensory

23
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:55,558
receptors examples of those would be our

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,329
eyes or ears tastebuds this ll here as

25
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:58,858
well adapted ears since an uncertain

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,469
night so it sends the organ that the

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,570
ears is well developed here's an example

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,090
of our eyes being able to track that's

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,629
around us the path of sensory

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,430
information we have stimulation which is

31
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,250
the physical stimulus that activates

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,680
sensory receptors this is the physical

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,599
touch that's involved transduction is

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,979
the converting of that stimulus into an

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:25,349
action potential here the stimulus gated

36
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,900
ion channels in sensory neurons are

37
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,750
opened or closed an action potential

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,700
gradient is created as positive negative

39
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,069
this then allows the transmission which

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,359
is nerve impulses to be conducted to the

41
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:41,758
central nervous system the overview of

42
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,228
the sensory neuron information is for

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
example here we have water coming down

44
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,908
we put our hand out one a sense what the

45
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,279
temperature of that water is so our

46
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,960
sensory in terms of the skin that will

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,149
then lead to action potential and the

48
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,639
essence is transferring that sensory

49
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,950
information going up to the brain

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,609
sensory accent enters the spinal cord

51
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,770
where it synapses with the brain the

52
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:07,349
sensory pathway continues with secondary

53
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,929
neurons projecting to the thalamus and

54
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,939
the sensory pathway reaches the cerebral

55
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,759
cortex for conscious perception so now

56
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,829
actually into their thought processes

57
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,530
this is the water hot where's the water

58
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,439
cold this case an upper motor neuron

59
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,469
from the cortex execute a motor command

60
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:27,289
said now leaving the brain in red going

61
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,419
through the spinal cord the upper motor

62
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,209
neuron contacts a lower motor neuron in

63
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:34,369
the spinal cord and to our synapse and

64
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,920
his ultimate leading to the lower motor

65
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,989
neuron causing contraction of the target

66
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,358
skeletal muscles that contraction will

67
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:44,060
cause that hand to move up that could be

68
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:45,319
away from if this water was too hot so

69
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,699
while this sounds like a lot of steps

70
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:48,348
that are occurring then there is quite a

71
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,899
bit that is occurring this occurs very

72
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:52,399
quickly that nerve impulse occurs in

73
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,319
about two hundred and sixty eight ish

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,158
miles an hour so it's a very quick

75
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:00,858
process for this occur the path of

76
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,199
sensory information two types of sensory

77
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:05,090
receptors we have our XO receptors as a

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,339
name implies a Sentiments and the

79
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,620
external environment to just touch heat

80
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,389
or pressure intro receptors are

81
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,789
sensitively in the internal environment

82
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:15,739
in the gut or other internal organs and

83
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:18,198
as we see here our free nerve endings

84
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:19,909
are spread throughout in this case in

85
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,910
the skin this would be first sensing

86
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,109
kind of the president's maybe as heat

87
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:27,259
internal organs we see them listed here

88
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:29,060
these all need senses and information

89
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,189
that may be occurring even though we may

90
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,549
not think we can feel them directly the

91
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,840
body needs to have that information

92
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,669
sensing the internal environment

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,139
Herbert's use many different sensory

94
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,419
receptors to respond to changes in the

95
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,359
internal environment examples of these

96
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:47,060
would be temperature change turn to

97
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:49,219
nerve endings in the skin once in indict

98
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,289
cold one died warmth so you actually

99
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:53,329
have a separate one one just does not do

100
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:56,239
temperature one does hot when there's

101
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:58,340
cold blood chemistry receptors in our

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,530
arteries two sends blood carbon dioxide

103
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,870
levels in pain special nerve endings

104
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,060
within tissue near the surface the sense

105
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,079
for pain indication something's going

106
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,389
wrong also muscle contraction sensory

107
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,979
receptors called proto receptors are

108
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:16,189
embedded within the muscle and tendon

109
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:19,209
since this stretch of muscle touch four

110
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:22,699
pressure receptors buried below the skin

111
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:26,180
or that tactile kind of touch reception

112
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:28,069
and blood pressure neurons called barrio

113
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,379
scepters are in major

114
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:33,680
our is to either constrict or relax our

115
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:35,420
arteries for blood pressure other types

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,459
of sensory receptors that we may not

117
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,920
sense potentially on would be heat

118
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,269
receptors a very evident in pit vipers

119
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,400
you see here a snake here that can

120
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:45,709
locate warm prey using infrared

121
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,229
radiation these heat detecting pit

122
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:50,629
organs will have this snake to be able

123
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:54,410
to find this mouse which is looking here

124
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:56,149
very warm magnetism eels sharks and many

125
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,100
birds rank themselves in relation to the

126
00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:00,229
Earth's magnetic field allowing them to

127
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,460
migrate in certain routes this is why

128
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,740
they're able to might over long

129
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:06,169
distances they have the sensory receptor

130
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,389
of magnetism electricity is used by

131
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,210
aquatic bird rays to locate food and

132
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:15,349
mates and also it can be used by some

133
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:17,269
terrestrial organisms here we see how

134
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,180
this spiny anteaters also use

135
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:22,370
electricity to help sense food the great

136
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,829
link here for extreme vision and animal

137
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,660
science to help you understand or

138
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,939
develop a greater appreciation for

139
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,480
different types of sensory systems more

140
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,480
than just our own
