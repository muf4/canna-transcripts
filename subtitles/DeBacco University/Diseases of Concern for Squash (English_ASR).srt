1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
okay I'm gonna go over some diseases of

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,758
concern if you're growing squash include

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,040
a kind of a little list here of some

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,599
very common ones as well as some

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,339
pictures I've taken in the field

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,699
try to give you what these disease is

7
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,439
actually look like in farm fields to

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,899
give you that way to compare if you're

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,339
seeing something so first one we start

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,198
with this powdery mildew a very obvious

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,359
one if you're growing squash these fuzzy

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,750
white spots that typically occur on the

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,099
underside of leaves and shade your areas

14
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,629
key part when you're trying to control

15
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,689
this is to try to increase air

16
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:36,000
circulation and also apply products at

17
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,000
regular intervals now you want to start

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,439
at the very onset of this disease which

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,759
if you haven't seen it in your scouting

20
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,699
and you're into that first week of

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,019
August in southern New England probably

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,109
want to start your applications then

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,149
anyway this picture here I've taken in a

24
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,640
field where you can obviously see the

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,079
powdery mildew this is evidence of a

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,270
grower who's been making spray

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,698
applications as you see the center

28
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,440
portion of this leaf here where spray

29
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,109
products particularly organic ones that

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,420
work on contact only will collect you

31
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,920
don't see a lot of spores on the areas

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,689
where the Leafs curl up you see a lot

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,180
more higher evidence of these fungal

34
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,039
spores this is evidence of growers been

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,290
spraying and making regular applications

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,820
which is a good thing even though you do

37
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,820
see powdery keeping up those regular

38
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,408
applications is advised

39
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,599
now downy mildew somewhat much more

40
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,250
severe one it produces these yellow

41
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,459
lesions on the surface in the inner

42
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,500
cycle canopy this gray and tan fuzziness

43
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,879
now what makes this worse than powdery

44
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,578
as powdery lives on the surface of the

45
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,379
leaves downy is an internal disease so

46
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,359
printing resistant varieties and

47
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,310
planting early in the season can help

48
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,989
you get by potential late season downy

49
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,600
mildew threats because that's where it's

50
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,859
more common to occur cucumbers get all

51
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,679
the different strains of downy

52
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,420
other subsets which in the squash

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
categories it as watermelons and

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,530
pumpkins they are not susceptible

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,600
necessarily to all the six strains of

56
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,439
downy organically there's not a lot of

57
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,118
options

58
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,548
chemically you're looking at a systemic

59
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,009
like a phosphate and if you make an

60
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,750
application and it progresses after

61
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,340
about three days you want to make an

62
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,139
application with a different chemistry

63
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,670
and if that doesn't work then you may

64
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,708
lose the crop so keep an eye and

65
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,780
watching downy mildew trackers

66
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,688
talking with growers in your area this

67
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,218
is coming in pluck dysphoria produces

68
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:22,229
these white diamond street that legions

69
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:24,180
on the petals of the leaf it can

70
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,568
progress to the stems and also the fruit

71
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,680
itself usually not that much you can do

72
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:31,048
organically for spring copper products

73
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,790
that can help for chemical Bravo

74
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,069
chlorothalonil product to be the best

75
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:37,858
option then this is nice grand on this

76
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,619
off fabric here currents weeds and

77
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:42,450
allows for a clean harvest of the fruit

78
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,579
to cerium what to look for here is

79
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,768
wilting plants the vines and leaf stalks

80
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,450
will rot and the vines are cut ahead of

81
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,459
that rot internal veins you can look for

82
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,408
that orange kind of tan colorations we

83
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,030
kind of see developed here you want to

84
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:56,429
rotate your squash plantings with

85
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,459
monocots or grass species to reduce this

86
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,500
problem and also don't over irrigate or

87
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,069
over applying nitrogen as both of those

88
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,150
will encourage Fusarium to develop

89
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:08,429
bacterial wilt as the wilting of the

90
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,230
leaves as the name implies and this may

91
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,030
be the leaves may return to normal and

92
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:14,188
times of low light such as or at around

93
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,959
sunrise or just before the Sun

94
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:17,818
completely sets you want to prevent

95
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,549
cucumber beetle feeding on this occurs

96
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:23,429
because that is the main vector for this

97
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,019
and the control is harvest which you can

98
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,489
and then pull that plant out so that

99
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,829
other cucumber beetles no feed on that

100
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,889
infected plant pick up more the bacteria

101
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,419
and spread it to your other plantings

102
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:36,419
angular leaf spot you see here these

103
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,699
images are brown lesions on the leaf

104
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,159
that I follow the leaf vein causing that

105
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,139
kind of angular look to occur now this

106
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,120
can be seed born but it's also spread it

107
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,370
overhead irrigation if the catch of

108
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,549
early copper applications can slow its

109
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,560
spread in progression bacterial spots

110
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,329
also I want to talk about here you want

111
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,639
to look for small but numerous circular

112
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,739
lesions on the leaves and also can

113
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,239
appear on the fruit now it's not all

114
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,549
that common the high heat and moisture

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,109
can increase its spread and copper

116
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,090
applications would be advised because

117
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:10,219
fungicides will not work because keep in

118
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,219
mind this is a bacterial disease
