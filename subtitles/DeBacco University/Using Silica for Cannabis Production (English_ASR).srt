1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
in this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,039
going to go over the role of silica

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,599
implants

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:16,480
a study as well as applying it to your

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:17,839
cannabis plants

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,839
all right let's get into using silica

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,000
for cannabis production so

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,000
just to start with silica is uh it's

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,198
regarded as a jack of all trades when it

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,679
comes to plants

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,400
and some even refer to this nutrient as

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,039
a super

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,960
vitamin for plants it is critical to any

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,760
grow room especially in soils hydroponic

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
operation

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,960
simply because silica is found in high

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
concentrations

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,239
in soil now what is the role of silica

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
in

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,078
a plant so we can see a nice little

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,679
example here that silica does make

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,359
plants stronger bigger and more hearty

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,759
at least according to the marketing

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,759
some of the specific reasons growers use

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,399
silica supplements are for stronger cell

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,079
walls

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,239
bigger and stronger stems increased

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,280
resistance to environmental stresses

29
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:02,000
as well as pathogens and pests this also

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,359
improved metabolic functions now kind of

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
the premise is how it works well if you

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,000
don't have silica or low silica implants

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
we could see a fungal spore kind of

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,359
lands here

35
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,079
on the cell plant cell it's easily able

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,959
to penetrate

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,239
into that epidermal or outer layer cell

38
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,839
well if there was a silica layer that

39
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,920
kind of creates this kind of harder

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
outer barrier and the fungi may not be

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
able to penetrate into that dermal

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,280
that epidermal cell preventing it from

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
infecting

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,478
the plant so we're looking at silica and

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,519
improved disease resistance this is a

46
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,078
study

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,359
so looking at kind of comparing some

48
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,599
strawberries

49
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,200
and this study further showed to infer

50
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,719
the host pathogen recognition

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
probably by preventing signaling

52
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,359
molecules from finding their specific

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,799
targets

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,719
so in this example you're kind of

55
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,280
getting that communication

56
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,759
disruption silica was also suggested to

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
induce

58
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,079
indirect defense mechanisms by altering

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
composition of herbivore-induced

60
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,078
plants under high tunnels strawberry

61
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,960
plants accumulated as much as

62
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,718
three percent dry weight silica which

63
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,078
resulted in significant reduction of

64
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,239
powdery mildew severity

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,839
and higher yields on the other hand

66
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,118
strawberry plants grown in soil were

67
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,920
unable to absorb

68
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,959
silica whether amended in liquid or

69
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,280
solid form

70
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,400
so keep in mind that it is going to be

71
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,080
substrate specific

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,319
as far as how much benefits you might

73
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,959
see or might not see compared to a

74
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,560
control plant so how should silica be

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
added if we're looking at considering

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,479
adding this

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,159
well it should be utilized throughout

78
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,439
the entire life of the plants from

79
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,759
seedling to harvest

80
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,800
hydroponic systems can rely more heavily

81
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,120
on cells

82
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
supplementation it's also useful to

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
supplement

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,759
plants grown in soil however keep in

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
mind that if you are going to choose to

86
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,560
add a silica product

87
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,080
it does take time to accumulate in the

88
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,759
plants and should not be done one time

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,959
feeding to get its true benefits

90
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,239
to build up that outer layer to build up

91
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
that protective layer

92
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,959
it does take repeated feedings to be

93
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,919
able for that to accumulate in the plant

94
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
so you can get the benefits felt and

95
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,039
resulting of that

96
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
so when you go through and applying

97
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,560
silica well there's many different

98
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,719
manufacturers many different

99
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,598
companies silica can be applied either

100
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,919
as a root feed

101
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,359
or the foliar spray studies have shown

102
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,759
that it can absorb a little bit

103
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
more through foliar feeding than through

104
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,039
the root zone

105
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,719
but the root sound does have uptake

106
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,400
regardless of how you apply the silica

107
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,359
it's important to note that silica can

108
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
raise the ph

109
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
of your nutrient solution so as data in

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
the product labels growers are advised

111
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,159
to add this product first to their

112
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
nutrient feed

113
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,359
however do not directly mix any

114
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,039
concentrates together

115
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
i've shown you two kind of examples here

116
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,039
agricell 16h and

117
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,080
denegro protect are just examples of two

118
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,719
silica products

119
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,200
one in a powdered form with the kind of

120
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,840
list

121
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,119
of recipes right here and this one's a

122
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
liquid form

123
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
often they're done in comparison because

124
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,839
this is a liquid form the powdered form

125
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,680
you can mix up as you need it and you're

126
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,438
not paying or needing to store

127
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,879
water so again this just compares these

128
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,438
two versions

129
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:03,280
of potassium silicates hopefully this is

130
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,280
helpful to your growing situation
