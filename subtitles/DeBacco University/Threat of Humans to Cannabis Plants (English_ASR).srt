1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
so this tobacco university video is

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,480
going to take into account the threat of

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,559
humans

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,720
to cannabis plants and this is the

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,279
threat of humans outside of the grower

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,798
your neighbors and people around you

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:17,919
what threats they can pose

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,920
to cannabis plants

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,879
[Music]

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,439
all right let's get into the threat of

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,919
humans to cannabis plants so first off

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
people

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
and the cannabis crops well after all

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,839
the challenges of growing people can be

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,840
another issue that's worth

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,920
mentioning two main methods of negative

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,040
impacts uh can be complaints as well as

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,399
physical damage

19
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,519
points some girls will set this signs up

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
stop you're on camera about the plants

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
that they're growing

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,160
uh they don't want us to want to see

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
they don't want to see anybody

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,359
they want anyone to steal anything and

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,599
rightfully so so

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,679
keep this in mind that humans are

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
another kind of quote unquote pest

28
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,439
need to be mindful of so when we're

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,358
looking at the complaint

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,439
end of things before you start growing

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,239
an operation it's wise to inform your

32
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,920
neighbors

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
for indoor growing this may mean the

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,240
need to add additional carbon filters or

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
other means to reduce odor of the plants

36
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,519
because some people simply just do not

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,040
like or can't stand the odor

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,118
outdoor growing it's a good practice to

39
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,280
let others know and show them paperwork

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,879
if you have it regarding your license to

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,560
ensure that they don't

42
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,158
necessarily get surprised all these

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,759
canvas plants going in

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,359
they know you're doing it in a legit

45
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,159
manner

46
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,920
then know your local regulations so no

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
matter the size of your operations know

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,478
your local and current laws regarding

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799
regarding

50
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,599
cannabis cultivation some are very loose

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
regulations

52
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,519
others are much more stringent be aware

53
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,839
of the total plant number

54
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,239
number that you have in veg and flower

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,920
with those approved varieties and so on

56
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,438
you want to make sure you know your laws

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
your rules your regulations

58
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,438
and that you are also in compliance with

59
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,239
all of those now for outdoor growers

60
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,919
we're looking at the are suggested that

61
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,399
they may want to post signs that state

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
no trespassing at property boundaries

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,640
and also maybe inform people if they're

64
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
growing industrial hemp with no thc

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
to encourage people not to be removing

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,160
plants be also on the lookout for

67
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,239
trespassers as this can involve the use

68
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,719
of cameras in monitoring systems as we

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
see

70
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,280
right here i'll file a trespass action

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
request form if this applies to your

72
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,159
area if you do catch someone

73
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,200
this can offer a formal documentation of

74
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,959
that

75
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,878
secure your property use of fences can

76
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,479
make it clear boundary lines

77
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,719

part of that local network all this is

83
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,598
advised

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560
to try to limit the negative impact

85
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,199
other humans

86
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,199
can have on your cannabis crop
