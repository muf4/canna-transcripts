1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay I'm gonna go over some fertilizer

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,898
requirements for squash now whether

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,000
you're organic or buying commercial

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,980
fertilizer that's important always to

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,259
get a soil test for your fields and use

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,330
that as a gauge for initial amendments

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,769
however there's two fertilizer classes

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,079
you should have on hand if you are

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,118
growing squash the first one would be

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,250
early in the season that's up until

11
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,289
flowering and be a nitrogen source it

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,149
could be a calcium nitrate so a great

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,730
initial source especially the soils are

14
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,858
cool urea which needs to be incorporated

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,429
into the soil because if it's not it

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,550
will volunteer into the atmosphere or

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,558
blood meal for organic restrictions I

18
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,390
can also be used but I have a hard time

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,769
justifying Lee about a dollar fifty per

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,780
pound they're charging for blood meal

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,469
when these other nitrogen sources will

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,640
work just fine also

23
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,649
other than nitrogen you should get a

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,739
potassium for fruit fill not be post

25
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,049
flowering sulfate potassium zero zero

26
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,299
fifty is a low salt potassium fertilizer

27
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,649
there's also potassium nitrate if

28
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,390
they're still need for some residual

29
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,948
nitrogen that's a good source but rarely

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,290
do you need to be adding both nitrogen

31
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,629
and potassium especially late in the

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,520
season so again you take a soil test to

33
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,739
get the exact amounts that you may need

34
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,478
these are two good classifications of

35
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,959
fertilizer to have on hand if you're

36
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:17,959
growing squash
