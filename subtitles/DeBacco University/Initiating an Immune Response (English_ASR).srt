1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
okay here we're gonna look at initiating

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,628
an immune response and while we do have

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,638
our innate immunity and our adaptive

4
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:11,129
immunity or a spoken-- focus a little

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,718
bit more on the adaptive immunity if you

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,330
in mind our innate Metis what we're born

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,820
with and includes surface defenses

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,769
physical barriers such as our skin and

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,420
mucous membranes we're gonna look a

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,719
little bit more about the activation of

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,170
T in B cells so the first part is the

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:31,169
body needs to be able to identify cells

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,809
as friend or as foe it does that with

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,239
self MHC markers located on the cell

15
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,419
surface in this case these markers

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,699
indicate self and indicate to the immune

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,609
system that these cells were naturally

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,739
made and are part of the body however in

19
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,140
this case we know assistance of non-self

20
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,419
or a foe marker these antigens are

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,558
different or foreign they don't match

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,100
the host cell markers as a result this

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,358
would initiate an immune response

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,129
macrophages are the ones responsible for

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,219
inspecting the surface of cells looking

26
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:08,759
for self MHC proteins the cell displays

27
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,978
the MHC protein antigen self non-self

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,830
combination the macrophage will secrete

29
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:17,039
the protein interleukin 1 and send an

30
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:20,989
alarm signal to initiate other cells for

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,130
this immune response to occur now of our

32
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:25,679
foreign body and our macrophage

33
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:28,109
recognizes that as a foreign body the

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,350
cd4 proteins required to authenticate

35
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:34,289
this transaction the interleukin 1

36
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:37,048
estimates helper T cells to initiate two

37
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,049
things and one end it's initiating a

38
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,270
cellular response resulting which is

39
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,130
responsible by the T cells in the

40
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:47,819
humoral response which is responsible by

41
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:50,039
the B cells and we see here now the T

42
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,069
cells in the cellular response once

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,710
activated the helper T cells secrete

44
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,500
interleukin 2 which activates cytotoxic

45
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:01,408
T cells to recognize and destroy cells

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,959
with the specific antigen found in the

47
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,609
antigen presenting cell keep in mind

48
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,228
this interaction the cell to cell

49
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,318
communication in binding is very

50
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:13,740
important we have our MHC 2 here's our

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,349
antigen these are t-cell receptor

52
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,020
this is activating the helper t-cells

53
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,039
this is then initiating these cytokines

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,930
to be released and is activated

55
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:28,560
cytotoxic t-cell is going through and

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,140
lice in this infected cell here through

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,210
this binding occurs now this method that

58
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,639
it chooses to use is very similar to

59
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,140
those of natural killer cells and it

60
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,689
stimulates the proliferation in

61
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,899
activation of these cytotoxic t-cells to

62
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:45,359
help initiate this cellular response to

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,659
help control these infected cells that

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,170
might be circulating throughout the body

65
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:54,150
our t-cells in the cellular response

66
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:56,009
well cytotoxic t-cells will also attack

67
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,990
transplant tissue and cause graft

68
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,159
rejection so when something it's an

69
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,710
organ transplant

70
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,840
it's the cytotoxic t-cells that may

71
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:09,270
cause that organ to be rejected the drug

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,490
cyclosporine in activates cytotoxic

73
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,710
t-cells this will be given after our

74
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,719
transplant to help reduce the chance of

75
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:19,230
someone's body rejecting the organ that

76
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,479
they just received now B cells are

77
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:24,329
responsible for the humoral response the

78
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,939
antigens here in antibodies is the T

79
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,800
part they produce so B cells recognize

80
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,079
nating microbes but do not go on the

81
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,670
attack themselves these cells are

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,060
responsible for producing antibodies

83
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:38,339
that inactivate in mark pathogens for

84
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,949
destruction by nonspecific immune

85
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,560
defenses so here we see B cell producing

86
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:46,889
a lot of antibodies these antibodies be

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:51,180
very specific ends here to bind to very

88
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,919
specific antigens now the B cells and

89
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,439
humoral response a little bit more

90
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,569
complicated here but we do see our b

91
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,229
cells become inactivated and in

92
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,719
producing antibodies marking this

93
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:06,869
construction now B cells combined free

94
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,960
and unprocessed Incentive antigens these

95
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,909
antigens are endo settees processed it

96
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,159
presented on the surface with MHC

97
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:17,040
proteins keep in mind has image c

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,069
markers their antigen MHC complex is

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,200
indicating a this is an antigen that we

100
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:24,930
need to be able to recognize and be able

101
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,000
to destroy because we've now marked this

102
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,459
as a foreign invader

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,800
the helper T cells recognizes complex

104
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,049
and they will stimulate D cells to

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,420
proliferate into memory cells and plasma

106
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,160
cells which are the plasma cells which

107
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,439
are responsible for the production of

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,700
the antibodies and here's our memory B

109
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,680
cell for a long-term memory lastly just

110
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,769
a couple last notes here about the

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,769
antibody action all antibodies forming

112
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:54,750
antigen antibody immune complex every

113
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:56,810
antibody has a very specific binding

114
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,069
site they match a specific antigen

115
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,649
please keep in mind that antibodies

116
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:03,659
themselves do not destroy the antigen in

117
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,539
D bodies in activate and tag it for

118
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,670
destruction that's their sole purpose

119
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,819
it's this taggle tagging in labeling

120
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,610
component the antibodies themselves are

121
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,980
not doing the destruction they are

122
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,439
merely being able to inactivate it and

123
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,020
tag it for destructions that other cells

124
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,060
can come about and do the work of

125
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,250
actually destruction of the pathogen

126
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,220
it's not specific to D antibodies

127
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,709
antibodies are very important for the

128
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,540
binding and identification but not for

129
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:36,319
the step of actually lie sink or

130
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,319
destroying the cell
