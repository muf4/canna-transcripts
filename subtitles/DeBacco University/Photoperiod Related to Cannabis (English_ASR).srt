1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
okay here we're gonna look at photo

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,459
periods related to cannabis so it's more

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,349
than just hang lights over your plants

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,719
and lighting them you have to be mindful

5
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,910
of the duration of light and darkness

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,279
that you're giving your plants while

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,410
this photo periods may now apply to auto

8
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,448
flowering varieties all the other

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,060
varieties and cultivars is a very

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,939
important to be a vastly affect the

11
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,379
stage that your plants are in so photo

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,028
period first what is that well it's the

13
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,250
amount of continuous hours of light the

14
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,989
plant receives however the hours of

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,689
continuous darkness is what regulates

16
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,519
the plant not the hours of light so I do

17
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,500
think about the hours of light that is

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600
important but remember plants can't

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,340
perceive kind of the amount of hours

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,679
they've been exposed to a light you can

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,989
really only tell time by the continuous

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,590
hours of darkness they've been exposed

23
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:52,229
to a photo paired controlled flowering

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,449
so can this plant that receives zero to

25
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,259
six hours of darkness or when I think on

26
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:57,000
the light side

27
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,439
eighteen to twenty-four hours of light

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,390
will remain in the vegetative growth

29
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,459
phase it's important to keep in mind

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,228
that vegetative or flowering can happen

31
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,239
at any stage of the plant development

32
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,188
since its dependent on photo period

33
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,969
again for your cultivars other than the

34
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:10,889
auto flowers

35
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,420
however when cannabis receives in

36
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,760
evening twelve hours of continuous

37
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,769
darkness and twelve hours in containers

38
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,350
light that will induce flower

39
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,149
development so if you want to keep it in

40
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,280
a vegetative state then we call flip the

41
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,040
lights change them over that is going to

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,710
affect what stage of growth at that

43
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,000
plant will be in now these photo periods

44
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,309
you might hear terms called long day or

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,590
short day canvasses cement to the point

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,030
city an example here auto flowering

47
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,130
plants will flower based more on plant

48
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,379
age rather than late exposure there's

49
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,019
something important here so here's our

50
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,908
24 hours and we have that critical

51
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,879
period so if we extend beyond that

52
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,140
critical period oil state vegetative

53
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,629
however less than that critical period

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,280
it's about 12 hours in cannabis and we

55
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,949
have that 12 hours of darkness

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,500
13 hours of darkness will reduce

57
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,899
flowering however it's important here

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,849
are these special cases you'll notice

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,460
the end result is the same as here where

60
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:07,140
they're both in vegetative phase here we

61
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,409
have the same conditions is here that

62
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,419
would normally stay the vegetative we

63
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:14,129
have a 10-second cover not really

64
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,739
affecting the total hours of a continued

65
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,169
darkness so it mimics this situation

66
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,180
we're get to look confusing this here is

67
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:23,609
where we have this condition which

68
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,740
should have it flower but we have a 10

69
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,290
second bright flash of light in the

70
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,700
middle breaking that as a result we

71
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,439
don't have these continuous hours of

72
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,569
darkness we have these small portions

73
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,689
here these small portions kind of

74
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:39,180
replicate this area here resulting in

75
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,400
the vegetative phase so this is just

76
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,960
important to keep in mind that those

77
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,730
continuous hours of darkness are very

78
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,770
important we don't want to break that

79
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:49,079
cycle halfway through turn bright light

80
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,939
on and check something and then turn

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,310
that right right right back off you're

82
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,629
gonna potentially mess up the photo

83
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,969
period of what you may think can be

84
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,019
exposing your plants to there's some

85
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,550
other plants that kind of follow

86
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,380
something differently here

87
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,360
but the point Cydia does match the

88
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,250
example here and again we see the

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,160
flashing light will affect whether that

90
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,590
plant will flower or not now we call its

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,319
phone appeared flipping you want to go

92
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,090
from a clearly from a vegetative

93
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,370
promoting photo period directly to a

94
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,960
flower inducing photo period you want to

95
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,580
switch back and forth between photo

96
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,590
periods because this results in a stress

97
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,420
to the plant this is where a good timer

98
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,550
that has correctly programmed it's

99
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,019
imperative you want to go right from

100
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,160
that kind of summer time into that

101
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,290
winter time you don't want to kind of

102
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,329
mimic a fall or transition from one to

103
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,879
another you want to flip right from one

104
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,650
right to the other it will help you

105
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,409
control the height of that plant also

106
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,689
and reduce the stress on it now turn

107
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:44,219
that proper photo period set up in

108
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,780
checked lighting before the plants go

109
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,240
under that light or that change in photo

110
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,280
period often timers are great but

111
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,659
they're only as good as the operator can

112
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,669
array that you could buy the best timer

113
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,439
in the world just like you'd have the

114
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,659
fastest car on the track but if you're

115
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,099
not a good operator can really have

116
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,479
negative effects so make sure you're

117
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,549
comfortable with it whatever time were

118
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,639
you're using and you also double check

119
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,870
to make sure it's working like you want

120
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,759
the lights out period or during the dark

121
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,140
period do not turn lights on even for a

122
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,959
short period of time to check on the

123
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,099
plans as this will interrupt their

124
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,170
natural continuous and darkness

125
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,759
perception remember plants can only tell

126
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,199
hours of continuous darkness if you do

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,149
have like this camera flash that comes

128
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,069
through that could potentially mess up

129
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,859
that perceived photo period by the plant

130
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:27,839
however if you must check the plants all

131
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,100
right for whatever reason you don't

132
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,689
twelve hours and you gotta go through

133
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,460
and check them for some reason he's

134
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,649
what's called plant safe light and

135
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,509
that's a green light and it's a spectrum

136
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,339
that the plants ideally can't see or

137
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,889
perceive and they'll think that it's

138
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,109
still the hours of darkness so that

139
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,400
green light provides a grower light to

140
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,949
see and take care of plants if it's

141
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,870
necessary but it's not seen by plants

142
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,060
and helps maintain continual hours of

143
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,040
darkness we see the comparison here says

144
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,470
a girl facility had visited the green

145
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,610
safe light and the white light so you

146
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,230
want to make sure that white light would

147
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,730
be off and you're only using the green

148
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,460
light if you want your plants to

149
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,870
maintain the proper photo period so you

150
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,239
can keep them in this stage of

151
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,769
development that best fits the grow

152
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,769
cycle that you're working on
