1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,349
here we'll look at the plant hormone

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,929
trike antinol and while this may be sold

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,268
in powders for our growers to use

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,399
because of its many listed benefits and

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,900
research be careful where you purchased

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,940
those powders and exactly the

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,269
concentrations you're using because it

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:20,670
can have a very fast effects on plants

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,469
and very variable effects that can also

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,500
cause plant harm if you use too much of

11
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,149
it as with any hormone so in general

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,368
where is it found well it's found in the

13
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,348
cuticle waxes in in beeswax actually

14
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,058
it's a growth stimulant for many plants

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,090
so it works across many different plant

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,549
species research has reported that it

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,270
can improve growth in yield and

18
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,738
photosynthesis and protein synthesis

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,410
uptake of water and nutrients nitrogen

20
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,299
fixation and enzyme activities all these

21
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:50,398
are great things that growers are always

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,218
seeking for a ways to improve this is

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,299
why this hormone trike antinol vvt-i

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,859
a has gotten so much attention now it

25
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,659
can increase free amino acids and we do

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,210
sugars inside wall proteins in rice and

27
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:07,679
maize within five minutes so it's very

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,170
fast-acting also being applied at nano

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
molar concentrations at some very small

30
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,368
concentrations there's been reports

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,849
within one minute of the roots and

32
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:20,400
plants and shoots noticing in effect so

33
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,769
this hormone in particular can work

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,200
extremely fast one to five minutes of

35
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,658
application there can already be a plant

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,978
response so that's important if you're

37
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,409
looking at adding this to be very

38
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,179
careful because you can change the

39
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,420
potential physiology of the plant very

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,500
quickly some of the benefits though are

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,478
that can increase in dry matter

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,810
production could lead to an increase in

43
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,009
secondary products all great things

44
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,719
there's also strong evidence that

45
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,368
application of tri Cantona applied to

46
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,019
either the root medium or the leaves

47
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:51,180
enhance the growth and yields of

48
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,780
vegetables and other crops including

49
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,479
agronomic and horticultural crops as

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,149
well as medicinal and aromatic crops

51
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,209
under normal in adverse conditions so

52
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:07,439
this is great potential research showing

53
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:10,109
that this can help improve the yield of

54
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,419
crops with very small quantities it can

55
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,650
act very quickly in those crops this is

56
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,688
why continues to

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,579
look out further research because while

58
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:19,289
we may be noticing these benefits

59
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,969
particularly for vegetables if it's

60
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:22,859
something we're consuming we want to

61
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:25,469
make sure that's tested and vetted for a

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,890
proper process so that's safe for human

63
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,889
consumption
