1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
many growers looking for a simple form

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,759
of irrigation go with overhead

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,410
irrigation and that's what this video is

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:14,559
about

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:15,839
[Music]

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,358
all right let's get into overhead

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,960
irrigation equipment for outdoor

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,679
cannabis production

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
so first off aura overhead irrigation in

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,920
general

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,839
we're looking at overhead irrigation

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,560
it's a system that's a lot like a long

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,599
a lawn sprinkler and in small

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,879
applications

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,558
long sprinklers can do just fine water

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800
is basically pumped under pressure and

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,640
sprayed down onto the plants

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,078
via a flat spray nozzle and that can be

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
very small here

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,640
or a very large application as we see

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,599
here it may be mounted as part of an

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,679
overhead network

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,520
network of aluminum pipes or even simply

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,039
mounted on this top of a stake

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,680
again depending on the size of the

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,079
operation now over the advantages

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,840
of overhead irrigation is that it

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,679
visibly

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,520
confirms system uniformity very easy for

30
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,079
a grower to check and make sure

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,079
there is an even spread of water offer

32
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,920
this also offers a very large coverage

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,438
area for a relatively small number of

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
pipes

35
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,719
a long product life often 10 years or

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,959
greater

37
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,759
can be used for germination fertigation

38
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,719
communication

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,118
and as well as frost control it can

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,599
offer

41
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,519
short irrigation intervals and lower

42
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,519
maintenance costs than other systems and

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,879
this is why overhead irrigation can be

44
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,560
so popular

45
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,319
however there's also some challenges

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,759
with overhead irrigation

47
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,000
as it has a higher potential for

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,719
evaporation in wind drift issues

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,359
compared to

50
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,798
drip irrigation it also waters both the

51
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,640
crops and the weeds it's kind of a

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
general kind of coverage

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,239
it can not be used or it's not

54
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,478
recommended to use with crops that are

55
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,399
susceptible to foliar diseases

56
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,399
because that wetting of the leaves can

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,478
increase the odds of that occurring

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,640
there's also higher potential of runoff

59
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:58,078
and erosion compared to drip irrigation

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,319
when utilizing overhead irrigation here

61
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,679
now the system can be portable which is

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,118
one of the advantages

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
is that this can help increase the

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,879
flexibility it's possible to set up some

65
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,560
mainline tubing and then move the

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,840
overhead sprinklers to these locations

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,598
of irrigation

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,759
this can limit the number of irrigation

69
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,679
heads required but can also become a

70
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,679
hassle which may reduce the chance

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,439
of plants getting proper amounts of

72
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,480
irrigation especially if you have

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,318
different fields

74
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,079
so just because it is possible to move

75
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,399
this around and go through and transport

76
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
it

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
does not mean sadly always the growers

78
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,958
will go through and do that

79
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,679
especially when you're irrigating tends

80
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,759
to be those hot long summer days

81
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,120
now there is large scale use of overhead

82
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,959
irrigation so

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
uh large-scale operations called center

84
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,759
pivots are popular in the west of the

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,120
mississippi river

86
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,280
now that you may have seen without

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,239
realizing it see big circles the pac-man

88
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
like looking things

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,400
out on fly flying over these

90
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
large expansive areas center pivot is a

91
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,879
big well here and this basically does is

92
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
rotate

93
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,239
right around goes right around in a

94
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,280
circle format and that's what you're

95
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
seeing with these large

96
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,919
looks like crop circles now when we're

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,039
looking at calculations

98
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,479
it's going to be quite simple you want

99
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,199
to calculate the flow rate in gallons

100
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,359
per minute

101
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,318
and then determine the coverage area but

102
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,319
getting into

103
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,318
more specifics can increase the amount

104
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,399
of complications but does

105
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,079
improve the efficiency there's a

106
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
reference article here as well as

107
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
another video i'll be going over to help

108
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,840
you with some of those calculations

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,039
to make sure you're if you're choosing

110
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,479
overhead irrigation

111
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,120
you're making it as efficient as

112
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,119
possible
