1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
hyrum look at the plant hormones osmotic

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:11,119
acid also known as Jasmine aids now this

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,589
can be abbreviated GA and since the

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,779
1980s details have become better

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,129
understood this is one of those plant or

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,519
moans it's kind of gone there's some

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:23,339
recent research in some recent findings

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,989
is a lipid derived stress hormones that

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,789
thrive the picture of the fats here and

10
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,250
that's important because it's found in

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,019
the membrane in the phospholipid bilayer

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,320
of the chloroplasts and keep in mind

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,479
that is the light receding organelle

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,969
here that is responsible for the

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,759
photosynthetic process jasmine eights

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,530
regulate plant annotations to two biotic

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,170
stresses they can be activated during

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,390
herbivore attack or pathogen infection

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,910
so this is an example of something that

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,649
can be upregulated in times of stress to

21
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,259
the plant it's also involved with

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,420
abrahamic stresses such as those

23
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:59,608
occurring ozone damage in ultraviolet

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,179
radiation so it can be involved also

25
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,150
with biotic herbivores or pathogens are

26
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,640
also a biotics which is wounding

27
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,109
examples there now said increasing the

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,868
number of studies have shown that these

29
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,609
GA s also function in plant development

30
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,859
now that plant development conclude

31
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,500
those primary root growth so very

32
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,060
important for root development

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,459
reproductive development and also leaf

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,590
senescence keep in mind senescence is

35
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:28,048
kind of the natural aging of the plant

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,969
that causes eventually to degrade and

37
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,460
fall off the plant so this is a brief

38
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,908
overview of adjustments or asthmatic

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,908
acid
