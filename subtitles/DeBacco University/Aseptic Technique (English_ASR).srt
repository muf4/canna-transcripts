1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
okay so here we're look at some of the

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,809
details behind aseptic technique and

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,539
what this basically is is keeping things

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,178
clean and to the point of being sterile

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:15,449
in conditions that require this to

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,278
prevent contamination so instead of

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,050
techniques our precautionary measures

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,579
taken to prevent contamination of pure

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,100
cultures and sterile laboratory

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,709
equipment treat all organisms as

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,960
potential pathogens even if that may not

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,789
be the case was this technique involved

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,710
it's kind of this isolation of things

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,850
that's occurring preventing

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,890
contamination allowing only the natural

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,120
bacteria in that area or that pathogen

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,950
you might be working with preventing

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,599
from getting from escaping and limiting

19
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,960
cross-transfer of unwanted

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,520
microorganisms the general goal the

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,350
proper procedure will note the chance of

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,149
that cross-contamination is he kind of

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,840
here touching a dirty surface and going

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,189
somewhere else

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,960
well the kinds of this simple

26
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,628
accomplishing it can be a challenge as

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,698
all portions of the process must be

28
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:04,530
adhered to you can't be sterile for a

29
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,149
little portion and then go on and then

30
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,849
not be sterling be sterile again because

31
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,939
you'll ruin the entire protocol there

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:14,188
could also be important for example with

33
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,899
food items to prevent contamination when

34
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,688
processing food and during the cooking

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,280
process I want to start sterile so in

36
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,839
the lab this may involve producing

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,939
previously sterilized products that come

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,340
in sealed containers here might be

39
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,618
firmer at the dentist office for example

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,100
or we left to sterilize what you're

41
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,569
going to use so there's techniques UV

42
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,819
light is one example there can be

43
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,019
sterling fluids it can be used so you

44
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,508
want to start sterile with whatever

45
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,828
tools you're using whether you purchase

46
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,250
them sterile or you sterilize them

47
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:46,769
yourself one have a clean working area

48
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,078
so keeping the area clean before during

49
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,759
and after an experiment are key concepts

50
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,769
to keep in mind this will help eliminate

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,868
the chance for contamination

52
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,478
this goes to equipment to IP using for

53
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:59,519
multiple experiments probes that might

54
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,649
be used for different areas you want to

55
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,060
make sure everything starts clean you

56
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,659
keep it clean during the experiment and

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,610
you also clean it afterwards wash hands

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,200
and use gloves so just because you're

59
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,640
using gloves doesn't mean you don't have

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,799
to wash your hands hands should be

61
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,139
washed before then you put the gloves

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,969
remember to wash your hands after as

63
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,229
well even though these ideally will be

64
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,150
creating a barrier between whenever

65
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,709
you're working with it's good practice

66
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,420
to wash before but the gloves not and

67
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,969
work with them and then wash after in

68
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:31,049
case anything was to breach the gloves

69
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:32,550
here have materials on hand so read over

70
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,010
the protocol ahead of time and be sure

71
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,320
all necessary items are in hand are in

72
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:38,669
places that are easy access this may

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,979
involve you're taking chemicals putting

74
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,269
on a tray as make keeping things in

75
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,699
close quarters to the equipment you'll

76
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,260
be using read that protocol fully over

77
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,119
and have everything you need on hand

78
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,919
keep it in close easy access this will

79
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,990
prevent you from having to travel long

80
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,699
distances but will this help increase

81
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,070
the odds of our chance of contamination

82
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:59,399
occurring you want to work efficiently

83
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,599
so the longer it takes you to make

84
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,760
transitions to greater chance for

85
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,739
contamination here we see we're in a

86
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,009
sterile hood everything is closed

87
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,920
everything is efficient plates are here

88
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:14,159
all the tubes are here we got a flame

89
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,739
everything is very close quarters easy

90
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,900
to find easy to get to and through

91
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,540
proper lab technique you should be able

92
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,590
to work through this efficiently now if

93
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,449
you're working with petri dishes

94
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,920
so keep the dishes closed and when you

95
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,229
need to access the media tilt the lid

96
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,909
just enough to gain access you wanted to

97
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,739
say remove the lid and go through heroes

98
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,819
this image would show you want to just

99
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,050
lift it enough just so you can get in

100
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,719
there transfer what you need to and then

101
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,100
close it back again don't lift that lid

102
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,009
completely off even though it may look

103
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,229
like good for this picture it's not a

104
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:45,389
true story all technique even if you're

105
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:47,250
in a hood this can still cause a chance

106
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,139
for contamination to occur you want to

107
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,639
limit that as much as possible hear us

108
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,019
you're working close to a flame we're

109
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,669
just lifting it as much as needed for

110
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,490
the duration at speeds that transfer

111
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:59,189
close it stack it and move on this is

112
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,260
all good ways to keep everything sterile

113
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,709
and clean which is important when you're

114
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:07,280
looking for high level of detail in your

115
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,280
experiments
