1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,160
so if you've chosen to elevate your

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:07,278
carbon dioxide levels to 1

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:17,920
200 to 1 600 parts per million

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:17,920
this tobacco university video is for you

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,118
all right let's get into carbon dioxide

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,960
levels of 1200 to 1600 parts per million

7
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,239
and its relation to cannabis plant

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,519
production

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,439
well first off those levels keep in mind

10
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,439
that 400 parts per million

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,359
is normal atmospheric conditions and

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,519
elevating the levels above this

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,479
will require the use of several pieces

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
of equipment

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,398
the goal is to increase overall plant

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,759
yield as we can see here closer to

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,679
atmospheric conditions

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,359
the same plant grown in just over 1200

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,600
parts per million you can see a much

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,479
larger amount of biomass accumulated

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
there

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,159
so the equipment list is you're going to

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
need a carbon dioxide source a method of

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,599
delivery a monitoring system

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
now there are other videos on this

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
channel that will focus on

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,640
those aspects but this video focuses on

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
the chosen range and its impact on the

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,879
plants

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,478
and the image i provided here just shows

31
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,239
if you were to use a bottle system

32
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,280
some pieces of equipment you might want

33
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,719
to be considering so that 1200 1600

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,079
parts per million growers want to ensure

35
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,920
the plants do not run out of carbon

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,959
dioxide to maximize the

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,400
levels they count for this so however

38
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,079
this can be corrected by ensuring a

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
quality controller and proper

40
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,679
sensor placement so growers that want to

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
ensure i want to make sure there's no

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,079
chance my plants running out of carbon

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
dioxide

44
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,039
maximizing the levels basically will

45
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,519
ensure they're not going to be carbon

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,439
dioxide deficient even at these high

47
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,118
levels there's no risk of workers being

48
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,438
in this space for extended periods of

49
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,159
time because levels about 5000

50
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,839
are considered to start being hazardous

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,719
to humans

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,000
so why not just add extra carbon dioxide

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,519
well we're looking at

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,879
we want to add extra carbon dioxide

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,399
because carbon dioxide levels beyond

56
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,560
what the plant can utilize

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
can result in ethylene production which

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
can cause early plant ripening and other

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
speed aging effects we

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,519
see here in the gif and looking at

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,359
ethylene

62
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,439
synthesis and sensitivity in crops we

63
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,759
see some kind of examples here

64
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,639
again this would be way high or elevated

65
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,639
levels

66
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,479
but this is why we want to be conscious

67
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,958
of how much carboxylate we're adding

68
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
because adding just more will

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,560
potentially cause

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,080
problems and not any benefit to the

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,479
plants there

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
so what over adding so when carbon oxide

73
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,840
is over added this can result in not

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
only wasting carbon dioxide

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,878
but it doesn't offer any benefits to the

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,080
plant can actually

77
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,159
increase the chance at reducing overall

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
yields this is why it's a good idea to

79
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,039
have an uh

80
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,120
an idea what the range you're shooting

81
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,560
for is and to make sure you're staying

82
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,400
within that range

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239
don't want to go too excessive and just

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
keep that in mind that 400 parts million

85
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
is atmospheric conditions

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
so again looking at 400 being the kind

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,599
of

88
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,920
minimal and then going up to you know

89
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,238
maybe 1400 and much beyond that you can

90
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,000
see

91
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,120
all of these lines start to plateau

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
you're not really getting much of a

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
yield of benefit

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,480
at those levels so you have to take all

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,560
these factors into consideration

96
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,598
as you make your decision for your

97
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,598
growth space
