1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,129
okay here we're investigating body

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:07,679
joints my joints can be used for a high

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:10,830
degree of flexibility or it can be used

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,439
to help in sports kind of make different

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,900
moves and there's a lot of stress and

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,629
strain put on joints in many sporting

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,460
events so joints in general well what

8
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,589
the what are they they're articulations

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,390
of bone the functions of joints they

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:27,420
hold bones together and they allow for

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,420
mobility and ways joints are classified

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,640
both on their function and also how they

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,739
are structured so you can see here just

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,840
a general joint here where I learn more

15
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,359
about the different types also are

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,370
joints in the skull here we may not

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
consider these as being very mobile

18
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,750
because they're not but these

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,210
nonetheless are still joints that occur

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,488
in the body the structural

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,198
classification of joints we have our

22
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:55,078
fibrous joints which are generally in

23
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,329
movable they appear in our skull region

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,120
cartilaginous joints which are removable

25
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,789
or only slightly movable we might have

26
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,618
those found for example the disks of

27
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,290
cartilage that help support our

28
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,269
vertebrae and synovial joints so zones

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,670
that are freely movable no the ones we

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,509
may think of initially when we think of

31
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,909
a joint now our fibrous joints are

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,938
strong connections between bones bones

33
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,180
are united by fibrous tissue and the

34
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,289
reason is they lack a lot of motion

35
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,409
sutures are one example they're not

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,259
moving joints of the skull syndesmosis

37
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,270
are where ligaments connect to bones

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,989
allowing for minimal movement judges

39
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:39,030
between the ulna and the radius and

40
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:41,879
mopus here is the specialized fibrous

41
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,909
joint that anchors a tooth to its socket

42
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:48,269
in the jaw so all these are examples of

43
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,100
fibrous joints here these fibrous joints

44
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:52,649
are really strong connections and allow

45
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,140
for potentially some movement but not a

46
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,079
lot or high degree of movement very

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,689
minimal in the amount they can move

48
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:03,109
cartilaginous joints are examples are

49
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:07,458
bones connected with Highland cartilage

50
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:10,318
symphysis here is compressible fibro

51
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:14,069
cartilages pads connecting to bones

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:17,109
allowing for some movement so of our

53
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,489
minimal movement between bones in this

54
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,110
case we're having a padding that's

55
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,490
occurring that's why there's cartilage

56
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,070
present there and that's why it's

57
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,370
considered a joint but not a lot of

58
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:30,219
movement between those simcha does this

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,590
are immovable cartilaginous joints that

60
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:35,650
can be found at the end of long bones

61
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,180
this allows bones to grow in length in

62
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,890
the pubic portions of the right and left

63
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,960
hip bones of the pelvis are joined

64
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:43,029
together by this a fibrocartilage and

65
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,849
this area here remember we want to

66
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,890
identify a male or a female we could we

67
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:51,759
look typically in this region to be able

68
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:53,859
to do so our synovial joints I said

69
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,859
probably the ones we may consider most

70
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,720
as joints and the articulating bones are

71
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,290
separated by a joint and cavity

72
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,359
bone surfaces are protected by articular

73
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:07,030
cartilage and synovial joints are found

74
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,090
in the joint cavity there are six main

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,039
different types all present here I like

76
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,959
about this picture is not only does it

77
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,689
show you all the joints it also shows

78
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,530
where you can find those on the body I

79
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:22,000
want to present these three at a time

80
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,459
so those synovial joints the general

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,610
structure of them they have cartilage

82
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,379
they have that synovial cavity they have

83
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,739
the articular capsule the synovial fluid

84
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:34,209
and reinforcing ligaments these joints

85
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,599
in which articulating bones are

86
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,759
separated by fluid joint cavity so the

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,639
reason why we want this joint containing

88
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,129
fluid is it helps create a nice

89
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,849
lubricating barrier surface between the

90
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,719
two bones

91
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:51,759
we don't have bone on bone contact this

92
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:55,989
fluid allows for ease of movement

93
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,639
between these two articulating bones so

94
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,769
again looking at some of the joints here

95
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,319
we have pivot joints which provides

96
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,569
rotation at the top of the spine the

97
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,659
atlas in the axis remember the yes-no

98
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:11,319
the c1 c2 vertebrae they are actually

99
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:13,419
portions of a pivot joint the hinge

100
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,239
joints move on just one axis in the

101
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,918
joints allow for flexion and extension

102
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,470
major hindrance include the elbow and

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,038
also our finger joint these are examples

104
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:26,380
of hinge joints Saladin's are for

105
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:27,550
flexion and extension and other

106
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,800
movements but no

107
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,030
rotation in the hand that thun that

108
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,150
saddle joint between the first

109
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:36,189
metacarpal and the trap attracts easier

110
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:39,579
let's the thumb cross over the palm

111
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:42,370
making it opposable so opposable thumb

112
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:45,939
would be an example there and that's

113
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,389
called a saddle joint plane joints move

114
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:51,969
against each other in a single plane and

115
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,129
we see that indicated here speaking an

116
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,069
example on the body would be between the

117
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,870
tarsal bones also major gliding joints

118
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:01,180
include the in vertical joints of the

119
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,220
bones of the wrist in the ankles

120
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,780
remember our ankles share less similares

121
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,419
with our wrists the condyloid joints

122
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:11,198
allow for circular motion flexed on an

123
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:13,060
extension

124
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,770
these are restraints between the radius

125
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,220
and the carpal bone so in this specific

126
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:21,250
region right here we have that example

127
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,780
of that circular motion that occurs the

128
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,490
ball and socket joint is a freely

129
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:27,038
movable joint that can rotate and any

130
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,218
access example that here would be our

131
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:33,788
hip joint the top portion of our femur

132
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:35,019
articulating with our hip bone now talk

133
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:39,430
about guys talk about cracking your

134
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:43,750
knuckles so what causes our knuckles to

135
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,819
pop you can go through and watch some of

136
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,949
these videos and help understand a

137
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:52,348
little bit about what's actually going

138
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,348
on with when we crack our knuckles
