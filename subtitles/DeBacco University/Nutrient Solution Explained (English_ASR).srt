1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
so this is gonna go over explaining what

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,330
a nutrient solution is and things to

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,918
look for when you're creating one now

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,689
put the picture here because this is not

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,210
a nutrient solution this is this regular

6
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,888
bag fertilizer now this might be able to

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,929
be mixed and made into a nutrient

8
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,448
solution but keep in mind this and it's

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,000
kind of raw solid form is not considered

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,580
a solution we need to in some way have a

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,640
solution the aqueous or dissolved in

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,409
water so since we're looking at us water

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,510
we need to start with target so what

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,679
what are we going to use so typically

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,170
what you want to start with is some

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,570
basic testing pH and EC or two easy

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,460
tests you can keep complete your targets

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,579
are starting with water in that six to

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,929
six and a half pH range in EC under one

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,210
hundred and fifty parts-per-million

21
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,450
reason why I want a low e seen this is

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,480
why ro or reverse osmosis water so

23
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,309
revered in for many growers in the sense

24
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,599
that the lower the EC is when you're

25
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,058
adding that allows you to add more

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,429
fertilizer and not have kind of waste or

27
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:02,099
background parts-per-million kind of

28
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,338
clogging up the availability of sites in

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,379
that water that you're using to irrigate

30
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:09,478
so pH is important as you remember that

31
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,429
peaches determines the availability of

32
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,109
nutrients in your plants if the pH

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,330
drifts this will negatively impact your

34
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,159
plants and we see that slightly acidic

35
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,219
range typically being where we wanted

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,950
want to keep our pH simply because most

37
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,469
of the nutrients are at the greatest

38
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,790
availability in this pH range you notice

39
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,670
for example calcium we get much more

40
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,650
acidic and we kind of lose that we start

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,689
getting into the basic range we see can

42
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,430
kind of iron will really drop out in

43
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,069
soil manganese that's why we want to

44
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,020
shoot for that slightly acidic pH and

45
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,699
want to monitor these so measure the

46
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,228
salts or nutrients in the solution we

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,759
want to start with a low ppm because

48
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,769
that provides you with more control over

49
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,810
what salts there were nutrients or salts

50
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,879
that are present in that solution having

51
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,040
a continual running meter is important

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,379
to help ensure you maintain levels at

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,270
the acceptable range typically you're

54
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:00,780
looking for around 300 to 700 parts per

55
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:03,390
million in EC of about half to 1.3 see

56
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,968
the bluelab guardian monitor here not

57
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,639
only managing measuring our parts per

58
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,590
million but our temperature and also our

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,479
pH this gives a quite a nice quick look

60
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,310
to see where you are and this is

61
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,709
slightly on the highest

62
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,939
I just kind of have it here I'm just

63
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,530
kind of waiting for it to balance out

64
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,840
maybe he's over at it just a little bit

65
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,930
but temperature looks real good and pH

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,629
is right in that general slightly acidic

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,490
range in that nutrient solution remember

68
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,079
that pH may be a Civic or basic

69
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,610
depending on what the main nutrient is

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,590
and that can be depending also on what

71
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,120
you're feeding so monitoring the page is

72
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,379
important with the ideal target for

73
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,360
cameras being again around that

74
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,789
six-and-a-half hour range it's good to

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,380
shoot for so depending on what nutrient

76
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:45,030
you might be feeding how you're making

77
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,259
that nutrient solution it can affect

78
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,129
whether it might be favoring more the

79
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:52,649
acidic range or more the basic arrange

80
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:55,019
so in hydroponics settings there are

81
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,819
minimal buffering factors which can lead

82
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,219
to drastic swings in pH it can stress

83
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,139
plants that's why I stressed the idea of

84
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,879
having continual monitoring because

85
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,069
without a buffer factor that pH can make

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,689
large swings when you're adding or

87
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,729
mixing nutrients whereas roots develop

88
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,439
there could be a lack of buffer in that

89
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,869
water depending on so solution you're

90
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,079
using so just keep it extra attention on

91
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,550
that if you're growing hydroponically

92
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,180
growing in media or the piece oilless

93
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,010
media or soil here these situations

94
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,050
there's more buffer factors and this can

95
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,149
help stabilize the pH and reduce large

96
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,010
swings from occurring even in heavy

97
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,780
feeding programs so it's one of the

98
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,879
benefits of growing in media it does

99
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,919
allow some of that buffer factor to

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,599
occur if you're going for example in

101
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,789
like a rock wall well there's a media

102
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,460
that really offers no buffering factor

103
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,590
so keep that in mind as far as what

104
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,170
meeting you're growing in soil is our

105
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,270
soil here there's a greater buffer

106
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,849
factor but you can still have swings in

107
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,670
pH so again watch the nutrient solution

108
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:55,289
that you're adding to your plants lastly

109
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,549
flushing plants so letting some solution

110
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,289
drain out of the growing container is

111
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,570
advised to help reduce excessive salt

112
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:01,979
accumulation in the root zone on this is

113
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,959
called flushing this is where you're

114
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,769
adding a lot of water and we have holes

115
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,930
hopefully in the bottom of your

116
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,370
containers if the catch basin here so

117
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,260
it's not making a mess anywhere and you

118
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,200
can kind of regulate and monitor how

119
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,669
much water is actually being flushed

120
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,709
through the media that you're using for

121
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:18,180
your plants so this helps explain a

122
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,920
little bit of nutrient solutions and how

123
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,009
they're utilized and what to look for to

124
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,009
maximize the efficiency of your grow
