1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
looking at different plant lifecycle

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,250
differences in comparison to cannabis is

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,780
gonna be the focus of this lecture now

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,519
the reason why I do it in comparison to

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,048
cannabis so you can be able to see and

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,388
appreciate some of the different life

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,189
cycles that other plans have now they

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,730
made sure similarities and also

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,618
differences with cannabis so first off

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,660
there's three main classifications for

11
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,160
plant life cycles first what is an

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,129
annual and they complete their life

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,890
cycle in one year a perennial lives for

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,600
three years or longer and a biannual is

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,429
a flowering plant that takes two years

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,890
to complete its life cycle it's

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,780
separated into a vegetative year on by a

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,299
dormancy period and then leads into a

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,149
reproductive portion of that plants life

20
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,099
cycle so cannabis falls into the anal

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,439
category we can see how it kind of

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,530
differs some changes from these two

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,619
other types so because gameÃ­s is an

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,359
annual plant typically grows from one

25
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,788
year and I put here in quotes here

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:04,789
because I want you to think here is 365

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:08,219
days but this cannabis or annual year is

28
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,710
able to complete a full life cycle in

29
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,989
this time period now as I said a year is

30
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,868
not that 12 months or 65 days especially

31
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:18,060
for cannabis the production of seeds is

32
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:22,379
the marker end of a completion of a life

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,250
cycle so we're able to grow chemists in

34
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:29,429
much less time in 12 months so again the

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,250
year or the annual plant year is marked

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,509
by the production of seeds

37
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,578
now this cannabis here getting and

38
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,618
keeping year in quotes only limited

39
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,469
amount of cannabis growers or breeders

40
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,599
are looking to produce seeds so by some

41
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,700
definitions that final blood contains no

42
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,250
seeds but that is the end of that

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,750
particular life cycle mingles produce

44
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,030
unfertilized flower because you map

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,269
cannabinoids to be much higher often

46
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,099
plant cycle is completed in 12 weeks or

47
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,920
less not 12 months 12 weeks or less

48
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,478
especially for indoor operations mother

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,799
or stock plants are kept longer but

50
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,118
these are only a select few individuals

51
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,979
figuring out door so outdoor growing

52
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,860
want to refer to what's called the USDA

53
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:13,709
Plant Hardiness zone map this will tell

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,750
you how in relation to what plants

55
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,729
Wilkin tolerate what can grow there or

56
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,430
how long the growing season is you'll

57
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,199
notice elevation could impact this the

58
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,900
Rocky Mountains are here the Appalachian

59
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,899
Mountains are here proximity to the

60
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,150
coastline and large bodies of water can

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,609
also impact this this is more important

62
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,579
for outdoor growing you can see areas

63
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:37,379
where it tends to be much colder

64
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:40,019
Kim is growing season is a crop cycle

65
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,699
and it's typically as when growing

66
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,530
cannabis to girls to overlap growing

67
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,449
seasons to ensure a continual harvest

68
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,370
indoor operations with supplemental

69
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:49,348
lighting can ensure consistent growing

70
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,389
seasons to make the schedule of end

71
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:53,488
products predictable so you kind of

72
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,739
always want to have some plants being

73
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,840
propagated some flowers drying and you

74
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,430
kind of want to keep this process

75
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,938
continual instead of going through just

76
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,219
one year in one crop now canvas has a

77
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:06,750
distinctive growing cycle so knowing the

78
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,729
natural cycle and what's required can

79
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,459
allow for each portion to be maximized

80
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,919
for quick turnaround time and a high-end

81
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,590
quality product it's possible to force

82
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,229
kimmel in cannabis into flower at any

83
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,209
stage of growth but it's a small

84
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:23,128
immature plant like this one if we force

85
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,259
this one in the flower would not be an

86
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:27,060
efficient method of production so

87
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,768
developing this understanding of the

88
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,199
growth cycle that cannabis naturally

89
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,739
takes on allows growers that have

90
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,169
control over photo periods to maximize

91
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,289
the production or yield they're getting

92
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:43,010
per plant trying to keep costs down in

93
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:43,009
yield hi
