1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
okay human go over proper cannabis bud

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,949
storage we're looking at you know a

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,469
storage closet here many of the same

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,589
parameters apply to cannabis because

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:16,048
again we're looking keeping the product

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,910
that we've produced Kenneth keep that

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,910
shelf-life as long as possible and the

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,518
quality is high for as long as possible

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,160
so storage use an airtight container to

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,989
preserve the aroma taste and potency now

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,719
the airtight container can kind of be

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,479
like the seeable Tupperware container

13
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:35,129
can be this little popped up here or can

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,078
be canning jars here which are another

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,790
great option keep in mind we do want to

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,579
be keeping whatever we're storing away

17
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,780
from as much late in adverse conditions

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,850
as possible

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,149
to again extend that shelf-life in

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,890
potency as long as possible that's some

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,270
storage options that through sealed bags

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,420
and kidding jars are great options

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,670
however be sure the container they are

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,920
in is air tight to avoid moisture

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,539
infiltration so that can be a vacuum

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,210
kind of pack here which typically is

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,519
used for meat products it can also be

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,159
used for leafy greens key part there is

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,170
to eliminate moisture from getting in or

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,680
escaping and keeping that as interior

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,879
conditions very consistent now the

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,009
temperature that should be stored at

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,688
dried buds can be stored reduce

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,670
temperatures because this will reduce

35
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:23,008
the temperature will help preserve the

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,590
long-term potency by reducing that

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,478
temperature you increase inversely you

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,640
increase the storage time of that

39
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,319
typically refrigeration temperatures is

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,930
advised four degrees Fahrenheit or four

41
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,798
degrees Celsius

42
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,079
getting away from those really warm

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,579
growing conditions but not necessary in

44
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,399
the conditions where it's really

45
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,019
freezing just those cool conditions four

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,420
degrees Fahrenheit or so off a

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,569
refrigeration can help increase that

48
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,310
shelf life and ensure your cannabis buds

49
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:54,919
that you've worked so hard for are

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,920
stored in the proper conditions
