1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
okay I'm gonna give a very brief

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,689
overview of plants app testing because

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,000
some growers are using this they can buy

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,679
kits that they can use at home the age

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,469
field provides a very quick way to

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,089
analyze some of the nutrients that may

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:18,899
be going on in their plant allowing them

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,219
to make quick changes if needed so with

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,349
our SAP testing there are some

10
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,140
limitations because the SAP can be in

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,760
continual flux kind of like taking a

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,618
blood test depending on what time of day

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,599
or what you may have eaten that can

14
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,299
change your blood sugar levels and we

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,558
have ways of regulating that plants kind

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,019
of the same thing they can kind of

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,530
change what's going on in that SAP

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,809
throughout the day also lights on lights

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,149
off when you're taking that sample that

20
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,159
can also influence it the advantages it

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,109
is giving quick results it's good that

22
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,238
similar to a blood test we want to be

23
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,670
mindful that depending on when we

24
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,159
fertilize when we feed our plans when

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,410
we're taking that test how greatly that

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,148
can influence their results also for

27
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,729
foliar feeding that can also cause a

28
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,920
swing potentially in these on sap test

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,140
results so again not saying it's a bad

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,210
test but the homeowner kitchen remember

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,000
are not necessary performed with the

32
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,259
proper protocol in a lab so just being

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,900
mindful of the data that you are

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,270
collecting this way not saying it's

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,439
necessarily bad but just be cautious and

36
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,000
mindful that when you're testing

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,849
something that can change so quickly

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,590
that could influence your results and

39
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,449
may be taking samples over a period of

40
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,130
time and kind of taking an average of

41
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,618
those might be a better approach than

42
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:35,839
using a one-time test and making a large

43
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,840
decisions based off that test results
