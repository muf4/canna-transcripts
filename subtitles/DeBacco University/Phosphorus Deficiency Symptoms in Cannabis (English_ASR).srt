1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,359
here we're going to look at phosphorus

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,919
deficiency symptoms

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,679
in a cannabis plant so looking at the

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,080
element phosphorus here we see

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,879
what a normal leaf should look like and

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,638
phosphorus is

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,960
mined and shipped uh large quantities

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,399
all over the world so let's take a look

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,199
at what the deficiency symptoms in

10
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,320
cannabis

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
look like so we should first realize

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
it's plant

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,719
importance you know why does a plant

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,560
even need phosphorus to begin with

15
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,239
remember it is a mobile nutrients that

16
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,960
will move through the plant

17
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,359
it's a vital component for phosphorus

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,359
bonds in the nucleic acids of dna and

19
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,399
rna so important to the vital

20
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:43,519
main structure of the plant it's also

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,920
part of atp adenosine triphosphate which

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,160
is the energy unit of the plant

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,039
so it's got some very important

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,799
components

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
to be incorporated for the plant to be

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,399
able to survive

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
in addition to the growth factors that

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,759
phosphorus is associated with

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,520
usually stimulated root development

30
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,920
increased stock and stem strength

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,640
and improved flower formation and seed

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,960
production

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
this is why it's typically for cannabis

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,158
associated with high levels in

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,760
bloom associated fertilizers

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,920
now the trial was conducted so this is

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,960
kind of a rare opportunity to see in

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
cannabis

39
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,158
what a phosphorus deficiency actually

40
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,079
looks like here's some of the

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
backgrounds of the study

42
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,759
cultivar's wife which is high in cbd

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
it's these plants you're going to see

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,079
about 80 days old they were grown in a

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,478
greenhouse

46
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,359
so the conditions were kept very

47
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,959
consistent

48
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,478
you see a control plant that was fed the

49
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,359
optimum rate of nutrients and then the

50
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,799
test plant

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,478
which was phosphorus deficient so here's

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
a phosphorus deficient

53
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,840
cannabis plant the early growth will

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,040
stun if p deficiency

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,520
occurs so you don't have that quite

56
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
robust and vigorous growth to start with

57
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,200
tends to be kind of subtle

58
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,879
in mature plants but since it's mobile

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,118
you want to look towards the lower

60
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,399
or older leaves and i have one circled

61
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,159
here in particular

62
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,680
phosphorous can be translocated into

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
buds during development

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,118
because it is that mobile nutrient so it

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,200
can move throughout the plant

66
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,879
so it's kind of those lower leaves are

67
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,598
the most likely ones to show a

68
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,439
deficiency if it does occur

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,359
this is a nice comparison between that

70
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,520
same phosphorous deficient plant we saw

71
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
and what a normal balanced fertilizer

72
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,920
plant

73
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,360
received there's a white wall in the

74
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,399
background and a green door to kind of

75
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
give you a little bit of that color

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
balance there

77
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
a quick look doesn't show really a major

78
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
difference the key is that yellowing

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,839
leaf

80
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,759
down here at the center of the

81
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,560
phosphorus deficiency image

82
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,479
that's characteristic of a deficiency of

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
phosphorus

84
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,318
now kind of zoomed into that leaf you

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
could see you don't expect that purple

86
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,759
coloration that can be seen in corn and

87
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,799
other plants and a lot of growers think

88
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,318
with let's see in

89
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
purple stock oh it's automatically a

90
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,439
phosphorous deficiency

91
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,000
not always the case that can be

92
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,159
associated with other field stresses

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,239
this is a plant that literally was fed

94
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,400
phosphorus deficient fertilizer

95
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,640
so you can see what it actually may look

96
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
like versus what you may see in typical

97
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,679
textbook kind of

98
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,679
characteristic deficiencies this is in

99
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
the in actual cannabis plant

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,000
example those lower leaves is where you

101
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,319
want to look that faint green color

102
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,840
to that yellowing that can often lead to

103
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,158
kind of browning as we're starting to

104
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,759
see

105
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:18,000
here in extreme cases so that kind of

106
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,399
zoomed in version of the leaf here

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
even a controlled experiment there is uh

108
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
where there's a known phosphorus

109
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
deficiency the actual opinions cannot be

110
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,120
very dramatic it's not one of those that

111
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,080
jumps out right at you and says

112
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,039
you know wow purple coloration or really

113
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
light

114
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,239
green or yellow or browning or burning

115
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
kind of

116
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,439
subtle kind of is the way that it looks

117
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
this lack of

118
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,479
obvious visual cues is part why growers

119
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,158
are fearful of the potential deficiency

120
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,000
they're worried they're not going to see

121
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,120
it so they always want to

122
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,799
over add phosphorus fertilizer

123
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,400
now the common fertilizers would be

124
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,719
added

125
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,239
even though it's typically not needed

126
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,199
manures if you're going in field

127
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
applications

128
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,719
can vary based on the source we're

129
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
looking at cow or chicken or horse

130
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,120
be mindful the bedding that's used

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,158
because that can affect nutrient

132
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,719
availability

133
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,959
phosphorus also adds organic matter when

134
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,120
it's added in the form of manure

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
kinds it can often be over added which

136
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,759
can cause

137
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,759
some issues uh triple super phosphate

138
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,120
zero forty five zero so forty five

139
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,319
percent phosphorus

140
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,319
usually based on a soil test you're

141
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,199
going to be adding that that middle

142
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,319
number there

143
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
uh very concentrated phosphorus and the

144
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,120
the downfall is that it does lack some

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,879
other nutrients

146
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
bloom fertilizers in general as you can

147
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,918
see here follow the recommended rate

148
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,439
uh typically very high in percent of

149
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,719
phosphorus at middle number

150
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,000
and often leads to an excess supply of

151
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,520
phosphorus in plants

152
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
which a lot of growers i don't think

153
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,399
realize the reason why i make this

154
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
phosphorus kind of warning here is it is

155
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,039
mined kind of in large areas

156
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
most growers over feed phosphorus so i

157
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
don't think they even realize that

158
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
they're over feeding the phosphorus

159
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,560
because they have a fear of not having

160
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,879
enough so the real issue of overfeeding

161
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,399
for growers are wasting resources that

162
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,399
are being more limited

163
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,839
so if you look at the graph here u.s

164
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,079
mine phosphoroc phosphate from 1900 to

165
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,399
2015

166
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,240
you can see a major ramp up and then the

167
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,959
mined in the united states for rock

168
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,038
phosphate

169
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,120
is decreased now most people would

170
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,120
associate this with reusing less

171
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,439
however we look during that same time

172
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,639
look at the united states net imports

173
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,439
of rock phosphate we could see imports

174
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,199
are on the

175
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,879
increase so even though we were mining a

176
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
lot a lot of it was being exported

177
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,478
now we've kind of flipped and now we're

178
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,038
starting to import

179
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,800
more simply because we're running out so

180
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,360
by over applying you're wasting a

181
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,199
limiting resource

182
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
now if you've seen my other kind of

183
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
videos you might see the

184
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,918
nitrogen one in particular i also show a

185
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
toxicity

186
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,519
image for comparison there's really no

187
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,479
toxic image because

188
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,159
it really doesn't have any key factors

189
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,519
so many growers overhead phosphorus and

190
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
aren't realizing it because there's not

191
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,680
that obvious

192
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,959
sign of toxicity or overfeeding high

193
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
levels though can

194
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,000
vastly reduce the effectiveness of

195
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
mycorrhizae or the beneficial

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
fungi for the root system in the root

197
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,919
zone of the plants

198
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,639
not to mention the wasting of a limited

199
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,719
nutrient

200
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,840
the increased cost and the potential for

201
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,680
groundwater contamination

202
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,560
so most growers are fearful of a

203
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,759
deficiency

204
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
most growers actually end up in a

205
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,439
toxicity range so just be mindful

206
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,919
and aware of the what it takes for

207
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,600
phosphorus and the deficiency symptoms

208
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,959
and what they look like

209
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,960
and just be mindful of how much

210
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,959
fertilizer you're actually adding
