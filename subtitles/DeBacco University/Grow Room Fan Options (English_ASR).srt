1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
okay here on look at grow room fan

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,150
options so I think fan is just a fan but

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,189
you can see here there's very different

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,669
than our location and also what their

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,990
intended purpose is for so first off

6
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:15,298
horizontal airflow fans is the ones we

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,929
see in the image here in here are these

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,850
help

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,100
these are circulation fans that help

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,289
stir the air the concept was introduced

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,618
by Yukon zone floor culture specialist

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,570
dr. Jay back in 1967 I linked the

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,089
article right here the idea here is to

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,740
kind of keep air moving here above the

15
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,969
plants these fans aren't directed

16
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,429
directly on the plants but they're

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,980
helped to here to keep that air moving

18
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,450
especially in tunneled structures now

19
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,069
oscillating fans we might be familiar

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,960
with they're highly recommend for grow

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,488
rooms and tents should be placed far

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,558
enough away from plans to make leaves

23
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,029
move but not induced water stress you

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,539
want to blowing directly on the plants

25
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,879
causing potential for leaf burn or just

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,280
inducing water stress just that nice

27
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,780
gentle blowing there is why iceland fans

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,579
there's two different types some can

29
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,739
oscillate internally list may oscillate

30
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,179
within the cage this might be one of the

31
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,390
more familiar this is actually a motor

32
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:09,118
will kind of rotate and isolate and

33
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,670
oscillate as it goes through and stirs

34
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,920
the air that way it helps prevent any

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,618
one plant from getting all the directed

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,710
wind and spreading that out over the

37
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:22,228
grow area now if an efficiency fans are

38
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:25,019
able to pull air about four times more

39
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:27,840
efficiently than push air so this is why

40
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,849
exhaust fans are directed to force air

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,579
out of a structure rather than rotated

42
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:34,259
to blow air into a site so these fans

43
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:36,000
are located inside the walls known to

44
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,959
blow air out here so that's what's

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,769
important because they're a lot more

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,438
efficient at pulling air than about this

47
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,000
four times greater than pushing air so

48
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,489
we may think that Oh might be good to

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,769
blow air in no it's a lot more efficient

50
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:53,310
at pulling that air out you see the

51
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:55,739
little Gary Larson cartoon here so

52
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,170
exhaust fans used to help keep the air

53
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,759
exchanging and a grow area rated and see

54
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,439
if em and that stands for cubic feet per

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,000
minute you want to calculate the volume

56
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,559
of the room the length the width and the

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,328
height that gives you the volume and

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,098
then match the fan that can replace the

59
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:10,318
air volume in under five minutes

60
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,359
some girls might even shoot for one

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,349
minute but under five minutes is the key

62
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,810
part here

63
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,280
if you have a fan in your room you want

64
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,659
make sure you want that is blowing out

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,979
even though you may think you want that

66
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,719
learning your face to help you make you

67
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,119
feel cooler if you're looking at pulling

68
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,979
air again exhausting holding that air

69
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,360
from the room and exhausting it out

70
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,099
would be your best option

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,380
and there could be different grow area

72
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,030
sizes so this is why there's different

73
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,819
fans that's why you want to match that

74
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,319
to your volume of space that's also

75
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,609
squirrel-cage blowers and they get their

76
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,379
name for the caves look to the fan

77
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,480
blades that they have they can move it

78
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,359
air well but are often noisy you kind of

79
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,389
like a hamster wheel in here so that is

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,280
one option that might be free fit for

81
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,079
your facility which want to know what

82
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,640
those are and they can be noisy so if

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,000
that's a concern take that into

84
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,949
consideration and with inline fans as I

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,500
have here in the grow ten these are used

86
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:03,569
within ventilation tubing to help pull

87
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,330
air through the ducting to be exhausted

88
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,979
so a carbon filter we have our ducting

89
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,990
and we have our inline fan here and this

90
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,909
is what it looks like this is used to

91
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,120
kind of send that ideally that hot air

92
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:16,979
after being cleaned through the carbon

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,409
filter taking out some of the odor and

94
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,049
then exhausted out here I also have a

95
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,090
variable speed controller which is good

96
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,580
for regulating how much air is being

97
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,370
exhausted and since this is a relatively

98
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,080
small grow tent a four foot by two foot

99
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,629
four inch fan should be sufficient for

100
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,390
this area now if you're not in a very

101
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,669
large area us ceiling fans can be an

102
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,839
option and they're good for super large

103
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,789
matters these are called Big Ass Fans

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,770
it's the name of the actual company and

105
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:46,769
they actually go through in these large

106
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:50,040
gigantic fans and help circulate air in

107
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:52,320
very large facilities they help keep

108
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,060
that air moving efficiently with minimum

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,060
use of fan motors
