1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
okay it's going to be a quick overview

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,150
of fertilizer requirements for tomatoes

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,099
now keep in mind it could be organic

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,870
fertilizer like manure or it could be

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,820
bagged commercial fertilizer that you

6
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,879
are using key part is to start with a

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,769
soil test and to amend your soil so at

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,439
least you have your general conditions

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:23,250
near that optimum level along with a pH

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,410
around six oh two six eight now for

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,539
field production looking at early season

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,060
usually adding nitrogen is typically

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,410
required especially if you see your

14
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,299
plants kind of going a little limey

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,179
green and it can be supplied through

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,949
calcium nitrate urea or blood male keep

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,320
in mind that urea is almost four times

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,059
as strong as blood meal so if you're

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,579
going from blood meal to you really are

20
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,199
not going to be using the same volume

21
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:49,320
keep in mind that these percentages of

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,059
nitrogen are that first number midseason

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,899
we're typically going to switch over to

24
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,789
usually a calcium based fertilizer this

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,100
is one from botanic here that's a

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,689
quality calcium source I tissue test to

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,149
prove that its ability to increase

28
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,338
calcium levels in plants if you're under

29
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,099
organic certification there's biomen

30
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,989
calcium which is Omri certified late in

31
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,938
the season looking at sulphate of

32
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,129
potassium zero zero fifty which was a

33
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,559
low salt is typically preferred over

34
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:18,688
potassium chloride which is zero zero 62

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,750
so a higher percentage of potassium but

36
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:24,539
also higher salts potassium nitrate has

37
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,219
typically not advised because at times

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,650
of the year you usually don't wanna be

39
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,298
adding nitrogen though if your plants

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,909
are deficient in that it is worth

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,299
considering that as a nitrogen and also

42
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,460
potassium source under plastic under

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,700
italic conditions same thing early

44
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,408
season nitrogen same as previous slide

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,759
midseason calcium but usually the later

46
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,579
in the season we want to do a potassium

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,769
and calcium kind of rotation may depend

48
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,679
on the exact conditions but in years of

49
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,239
hot weather where irrigation is

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,009
frequency is very high it can lead to

51
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,199
flushing of nutrients from the soil in

52
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,239
these operations as a result you may

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,460
want to have more of a rotation since

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,919
unlike field situations you may push

55
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,259
some of your early season nutrients out

56
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,628
of the root zone so there are just some

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,878
general ideas to keep in mind for

58
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,859
fertilizer requirements and it kind of

59
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,569
kept it very basic very simple

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,980
you no need to go overboard despite what

61
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,979
fertilizer companies may tell you
