1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,088
with any growing operation mistakes will

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:08,519
happen but here are some common grower

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,080
errors that I find in grow operations

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,429
we're talking a little bit more than

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,219
just kind of spilling the morning coffee

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,109
on the daily news here let's look at

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:19,320
some common and I love them listed here

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,760
grower errors so first off often growers

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,859
do not like to admit that they make

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,449
mistakes but it does happen you're

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,179
allowed to make mistakes I'd want you to

12
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,429
be too tentative and not do anything but

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,379
you can only make each mistake once

14
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,329
I don't allow for repeat so if you make

15
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,429
one mistake when I definitely make note

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,820
of that and don't let it happen again

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,469
so pruning errors is one example putting

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,119
us off in a combination of both an art

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,429
and a science and remember you can only

20
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,468
remove plant material once you can't

21
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,119
kind of put it back you can think of it

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,920
almost like a haircut you can always cut

23
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,049
the hair off yet may grow back but it's

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,689
gonna take a little while so you want to

25
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,209
decide on a pruning method early on and

26
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,649
stick with it for the duration of the

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,350
growth cycle don't want to be switching

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,539
from one type to another a lot of

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,890
growers will read up on one and want to

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,180
prune that way when they've been kind of

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,400
training the plant one way and that can

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,590
cause some issues long range that

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,390
switching Midway will reduce the plant

34
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,829
efficiency I'll make it very difficult

35
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,710
potentially to prune opinion which

36
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,868
you're changing from or to under

37
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,000
fertilizing this can result from a

38
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,650
miscalculation or in some cases were

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,810
simply just get cheap they want to skimp

40
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,560
on the total amount of fertilizer to say

41
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,719
about cost

42
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,609
now how much they skimp to they go ten

43
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,578
percent off the recommended twenty

44
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:34,289
thirty forty eighty percent of that can

45
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:36,359
kind of impact the potential on the

46
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,220
plant there however especially early in

47
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,140
the growth cycle is consent plans which

48
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,450
may offset the growth cycle currently in

49
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,250
damaged plants in contrast to that we

50
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,140
have over fertilizing in this community

51
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,239
of very similar plant problems is under

52
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,250
fertilizing by stunting and damaging of

53
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,368
plants often this isn't regarded or

54
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,560
thought of as being an issue but yes or

55
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,718
fertilizing can stun plants a lot of

56
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,299
times or fertilize fertilizing comes

57
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,789
from a miscalculation or often growers

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,950
think more is better so they add and end

59
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,079
up doing more harm than good

60
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,670
if the fertilizer is like an ounce to a

61
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,829
gallon they may had announced a quarter

62
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,568
ounce and a half making a little more

63
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,530
insurance that would be good for the

64
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,000
plant

65
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,860
there is a reason why that's an optimum

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,479
or ideal amount so you're just wasting

67
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,640
money it could potentially harm the

68
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,259
planet or contaminate groundwater in

69
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,569
addition there's also mishandling of

70
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,399
plants so when moving want to take care

71
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,780
and handle those plants with care if you

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,730
mindful of others that you're working

73
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,530
with as you don't want to do any

74
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,449
unnecessary harm to the branches as this

75
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,280
will reduce overall year yields if

76
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:37,079
you're breaking branches especially if

77
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,610
you move them from a flower room or from

78
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,500
a bedroom to a flower room just be

79
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,750
mindful of that shift shuffling of

80
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,400
plants process also be careful the

81
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,319
amount of nitrogen fertilizer you add as

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,620
this can help pick the plants slightly

83
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,659
more resist resilient to damage in

84
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,459
addition continually adding silicates to

85
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,989
the irrigation water can help strengthen

86
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,719
the plant structure making them less

87
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,789
likely to break branches again something

88
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,379
that can't be added once and fixed it

89
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:03,269
needs to be continually added in kind of

90
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,069
accumulate in the plant but it can help

91
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,810
strengthen plants if that does become an

92
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,789
issue but typically we just watch the

93
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,069
amount of nitrogen and just be careful

94
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,449
at the plant so as you are moving then

95
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,189
I'll transmit chop this is often a

96
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,708
direct result grows we're trying to rush

97
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,789
plants along the production process

98
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,979
there are different types of shock that

99
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:21,329
can occur light intensity when changing

100
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,849
the type of light that can cause some

101
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,430
damage so be mindful of that photo

102
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,109
period the time of light exposure

103
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,379
flipping the lights can also cause a

104
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,489
little stress on the plants roots

105
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,319
transplant shock when the containers are

106
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,180
changed so just be mindful we are

107
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,709
changing containers now you're trying to

108
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,010
do it without disturbing the roots too

109
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,479
badly so that you're reducing the delay

110
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,629
or the lag time that plant may have

111
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,729
during the transplant process

112
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,560
lastly applicator blight a very common

113
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,209
error I see in growers and this is where

114
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,280
a grower sprays the plant for a benefit

115
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,860
but ends up doing more harm or at least

116
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,110
some harm than just pure the benefits

117
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,630
some possible causes are the wrong

118
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,060
dilution rate product interactions

119
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,780
trying to mix too many products together

120
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,840
apply too hard

121
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,030
with too much force application made

122
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,519
during high light intensity that's it

123
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,189
for outdoor application avoid mid day

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,989
spraying for indoor watch mid light

125
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,449
spray or when the lights just kind of

126
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,769
first come on they're a leftover product

127
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,409
not properly washed out from the last

128
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,149
yeast causing potential interactions

129
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,860
there so applicator blades it's kind of

130
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,189
a funny term for the grower kind of

131
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,920
cause

132
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,600
the error so just be mindful of if you

133
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,100
are going to be applying something to

134
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,080
the plants that you are sticking to all

135
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,939
the parameters and not causing more

136
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,939
damage than good to your plants
