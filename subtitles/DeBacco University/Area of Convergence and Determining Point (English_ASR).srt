1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
okay here we're going to look at the

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,318
area of convergence and determining the

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,039
point

4
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,559
of origin which is very important we're

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,480
kind of analyzing

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,079
cast off blood splatter or blood spider

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,638
in general as far as where it may

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,919
converge

9
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,600
where that point of origin may exist so

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,559
looking at the point of convergence

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,760
examples

12
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,198
when we're looking at angle

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
determination and determining where

14
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,560
those kind of blood splatters may have

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
occurred it's very important

16
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,399
to try to draw lines and try to

17
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,358
determine where that convergence

18
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,359
point actually may be we see here on the

19
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,200
kind of cartoon representations as well

20
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,839
as a larger kind of real world image

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,719
here

22
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,640
where if you look at all these

23
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,759
individual little drops we see

24
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
definitely a

25
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,878
point of convergence located right here

26
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,679
in the red

27
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,359
circle now here's a five mil blood

28
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,759
squirted from a syringe at a height of

29
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,759
one

30
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,519
meter so the point here is trying to

31
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,039
give you an idea of

32
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
what those droplets may look like when

33
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,920
you kind of zoom in and look at them in

34
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,000
a closed space

35
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
and how important is able how important

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,320
it is to be able to determine the

37
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,600
direction

38
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,799
and also potentially the angle of impact

39
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,560
now that point of origin as you

40
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,159
mentioned being able to calculate that

41
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
angle of impact remember still length

42
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799
and width are two important measurements

43
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,079
you need to take

44
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
because it's the width divided by the

45
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,959
length and you take the arc side of that

46
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
to get the angle

47
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,640
reason why this is important is when

48
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
you're trying to determine that origin

49
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
point

50
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,519
knowing the angle of those different

51
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,520
blood drops can help kind of trace back

52
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,640
and determine the height above the point

53
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,679
of convergence

54
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
so here we have the distance from the

55
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,079
point of convergence and we have the

56
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
height

57
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,679
being able to use this angle of impact

58
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
with a string method able to kind of

59
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799
help determine that origin point which

60
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,000
can be very critical

61
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,118
when trying to reconstruct a crime scene

62
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,399
tracing origin of the blood spots well

63
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,239
we have the point and conversion method

64
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,680
which generates a 2d image but then we

65
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,359
also can take it a step further to point

66
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,759
of origin method that adds a

67
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,519
third dimension to it the application in

68
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,680
the field of course is to use it in

69
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,840
a string and a protractor at the scene

70
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
in our user computer and laboratory

71
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
to determine that point of origin which

72
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,519
will help tell the story

73
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,079
of what occurred at the particular crime

74
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,079
scene
