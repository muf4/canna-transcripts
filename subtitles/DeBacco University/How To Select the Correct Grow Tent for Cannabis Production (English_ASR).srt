1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
ever wonder how to go about selecting

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,160
the correct grow tent for cannabis

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,160
production

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:16,240
well here at tobacco university we're

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:18,640
going to walk you through that process

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,000
all right if you decided on a grow tent

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,679
it's going to be your environment

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,439
let's go through how to choose the right

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,198
one and what to look for

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
so first off there's many grow 10

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,359
options it's important to kind of

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,079
realize and that's going to be a good

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
thing

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,759
reason for all the options is a variety

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,479
of location that growers use

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,079
them for there's three main categories

17
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,599
and that is grow tint kits where you

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
could purchase something that comes all

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,039
inclusive and all together

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,960
there's multi-chamber grow tents where

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,000
there's different isolated components

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,558
within the general

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,439
structure and there's just a standard or

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,718
single chamber

25
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,039
grow tent and we'll walk you through

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
those examples here so first off the

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
grow tent kits you know there's

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,919
many different kits out there many

29
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,078
different options

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,480
many different kind of setups to fit

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,640
different needs by different growers

32
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,238
so they're ideal for someone who wants

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
to get started right away with a system

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,920
that works and doesn't require

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,600
much research or attention they're often

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
sold by the type of light that they

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,519
utilize

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
and that can be included and have a

39
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,039
large impact on the total price

40
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,719
while there's a lot of other little

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,840
pieces of equipment usually the light is

42
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,560
the driving force and the

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
main overall cost kits often include the

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
tent itself

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
a grow light a ventilation system

46
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,239
growing substrate whether it's soilless

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
or hydroponic

48
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,839
and a basic collection of general

49
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,799
accessories that would be needed

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
the focus here is to learn how to select

51
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,400
a setup that best fits your specific

52
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
growing situation so these kits are an

53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,960
option

54
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
but will not be the focus of this video

55
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,239
going to come all included

56
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,599
essentially the information provided

57
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,719
will help you customize your own

58
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,319
specific kit

59
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,399
for your needs or if you're looking at

60
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,879
certain kits these are certain features

61
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,079
you might want to look at and seek out

62
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,959
so you're ensuring you're getting one

63
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,199
that's going to work

64
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,559
well for you right off the initial

65
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,118
purchase

66
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,680
so going to the multi-chambered grow

67
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,078
tents

68
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,000
and just as the name implies they have

69
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,279
multiple chambers

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,159
they are intended for very space limited

71
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
growers

72
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,680
and they do offer at least ideally a

73
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,439
perpetual grow harvest

74
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
by being able to isolate all different

75
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,919
stages of the growing cycle

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
in one tent propagation the vegetative

77
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,359
stage

78
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,079
and also the potential for flowering

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
stage

80
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,239
some may even have a clone chamber or a

81
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,598
mother room as depicted right here

82
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
another better suit for entry-level

83
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,479
growers not looking to produce total

84
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
yield in general and using separate

85
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,598
tents can offer

86
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,439
better overall control conditions and

87
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,399
allow for more plants so these will be

88
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,560
what's focused on

89
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
in this series but realize that these

90
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,318
multi-chamber ones do exist

91
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,840
keep in mind though you do self-delight

92
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,359
each one have good ventilation for each

93
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
one keep them isolated so you're not

94
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
getting cross-contamination or

95
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
light spill over from either so again

96
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,679
this is why these multi-chamber ones a

97
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
little bit better for your smaller

98
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,879
operations

99
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,400
the standard or the single chamber grow

100
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,199
tents of course these will be the main

101
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
focus

102
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,399
you can always add more tents to get

103
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
isolated conditions so instead of having

104
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
them all have multi

105
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,280
chambers you can just simply have more

106
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200
tents and then isolate them that way i

107
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,878
have a flower tent have a veg tent if a

108
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,759
mother or propagation tent

109
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,560
can separate them out that way so where

110
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,079
will you be putting

111
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
the tent this is a good question just to

112
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
ask yourself in general regardless you

113
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
want to measure the area

114
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,400
usually at least twice to make sure you

115
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,919
didn't get anything wrong and get an

116
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,799
idea of the natural environmental

117
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,719
conditions

118
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,640
will you be needing to heat the area

119
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,239
more we need to cool the area more what

120
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,158
will be important to you

121
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,680
and keep in mind that if the area is a

122
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,878
little on the cooler side

123
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,719
if you're going to be running certain

124
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,439
lights or high intense lights

125
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,120
you may be heating the area sufficiently

126
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,719
with just the light source

127
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,799
common growing locations are a large

128
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,439
room a closet garage a shed even in

129
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,040
attic

130
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,479
but there are many other options even

131
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,919
beyond this so again you want to get an

132
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,199
idea of what environment

133
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,759
you're generally going to be putting the

134
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,158
tent into so that then leads to the next

135
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,359
question

136
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,280
and this is where all the growers

137
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,879
configure is bigger always but what size

138
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,158
grow tent are you looking for

139
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,158
you want to start with the square feet

140
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,679
of floor space the amount of plants that

141
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,318
are grown can be dependent on pruning

142
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,319
style

143
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,158
and total size of each below some

144
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,438
general idea of the average sized plants

145
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,280
provided as a guide

146
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,959
so you're looking at a four by two tent

147
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,039
you can get two to three plants

148
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,639
four by four tent four to five four foot

149
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,319
by eight foot six to eight and ten by

150
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,239
ten about twelve plants

151
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,358
then you also wanna be considering the

152
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,399
total height

153
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,758
so just because you're looking at the

154
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,439
square footage you also want to be

155
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
considerate of how tall

156
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,560
um what type of ceiling you have are you

157
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
feeling limited

158
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,079
how tall can you go can you get a tent

159
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
that's a little bit taller a little bit

160
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,599
street when it's a little bit shorter

161
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,360
so other than just a square foot you

162
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,919
also want to be considerate

163
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,280
of the height of your space because that

164
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,079
will dictate the height of the

165
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,279
how tall the tent can be as well so how

166
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,599
tall you go for your tent well the best

167
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,399
center is really as tall as you can fit

168
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
in your area you know they all look the

169
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,959
same if you're looking at them online or

170
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
in pictures you want to make sure to

171
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,839
tell us

172
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
it can fit in your area the reason for

173
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,799
this is it'll allow for more light

174
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,560
hanging adjustment options the plants

175
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,759
can be bigger if you need them to be

176
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
and there's more room for air

177
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,919
circulation as well some come at fixed

178
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,839
sites some allow extensions so again

179
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,399
what's the best fit for your particular

180
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,839
area once you've measured it

181
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,879
then when we're looking at looking up

182
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,319
anyway we want to be looking at the

183
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,560
ceiling support

184
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,000
many grow tents have a ceiling support

185
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,439
bars that allow for multiple options

186
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,439
running lights filters

187
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,839
fans while also bringing structural

188
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,199
support to the actual structure itself

189
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,519
so it's good to see

190
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,879
if there is good or adequate ceiling

191
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,319
support

192
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,639
because you're going to be hanging a lot

193
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,918
typically off this area so it's a sign

194
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,120
that you have a good quality

195
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,000
uh tent there lower temp vents uh in

196
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,759
access having

197
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,439
vents on the lower side of the tent can

198
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
help ensure cool air is drawn into the

199
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,759
crow

200
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,240
tent if possible if you're looking for

201
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,720
that passive ventilation system

202
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,519
in for the small and large access ports

203
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
it will draw

204
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,799
with drawstrings as we can see right

205
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
here this is a large one this is a small

206
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
one

207
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,560
those drawstrings help seal the growing

208
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,879
air environment this not only will

209
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
reduce a light splash but also carbon

210
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,000
dioxide links if you are

211
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
leaks or if you are looking at going

212
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,279
through and enriching the area

213
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,400
while there's still reason why you would

214
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,159
have these in the first place is you

215
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,839
want access to power cords

216
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,280
ventilation systems all these are going

217
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,119
to be components that you're going to

218
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,159
want to be adding to your grow space

219
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
and you always don't want to have them

220
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,600
going out kind of the main zipper or the

221
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,560
main outlining door this asks for a very

222
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
clean and neat installation process

223
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
now the upper vents we're looking

224
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
towards again the top of the tent those

225
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
multiple vents of different sizes offer

226
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,079
growers a lot more flexibility

227
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,680
there can also be a close so if there's

228
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,199
no real negative having more

229
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
at least initially need but then

230
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,720
initially needed by the grower meaning

231
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
here we see three vents you're like i

232
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
never need three events well you can

233
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,318
simply just

234
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
pull the drawstring seal up and no

235
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
problem there is a point in time where

236
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,639
you do need all three maybe an intake

237
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,318
an exhaust and some power will you have

238
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
that opportunity so there's no real

239
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,199
downfall if you're comparing two tenths

240
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,519
and everything's equal

241
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
one is a couple more uh vent options

242
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,399
here

243
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,918
uh typically go with the one as more

244
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,359
even if you don't initially need them

245
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,799
it'll allow you to kind of

246
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,439
uh be future proof for your structure

247
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,520
and lastly there are many manufacturers

248
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,439
so ideally all serve the same function

249
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,038
but there are some specifics to look for

250
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,560
i'm looking for what the type of the

251
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,000
frame is made out of

252
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,759
a strong frame at that because you need

253
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to support lights fans filters and many

254
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,240
other

255
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,439
things the reflective material on the

256
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,038
inside

257
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,879
a tear resistant material on the outside

258
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,478
would be great a quality zipper

259
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,399
double floor to prevent water leaks

260
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,159
outside the tent because you will be

261
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,560
watering even if you have catch fans as

262
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
we see

263
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,478
here all these are worthwhile to

264
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,598
consider there's other videos on this

265
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,359
channel that will get into some of the

266
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,199
manufacturers some of the comparison so

267
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
you're welcome also to check that video

268
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,759
out

269
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,758
