1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,679
an important part with the production of

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,169
cannabis and the end flowers here is

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,839
blood trimming taking the raw plant

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:13,169
product trimming it down to produce just

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,088
the fine nug or bud here at the very end

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,460
you can see here it's a very convenient

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,130
way our intensive process and take a lot

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,019
of time and this is for the manual

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,028
version so this is how many people get

10
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,789
an entry-level position in the cannabis

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,460
industry there bud trimmers for them

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,618
sheer selection is very important there

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,989
are some qualities you should look for

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,119
such as the size of the blades that are

15
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,599
used in the weight of the actual

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,369
scissors that you're using quality

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,469
equipment should be have non-stick

18
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,869
blades should have an ergonomic handle

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,730
and be lightweight because typically

20
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,799
this is is this a very labor intensive

21
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,269
and takes a lot of time but apart it

22
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,799
comes down to personal preference some

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,359
people may prefer the straight blades as

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,308
I should have shown here some a

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,289
preferred angle blades again that comes

26
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:01,439
down to personal preference but nonstick

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,460
blades a lightweight and kind of

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,140
something that's comfortable in your

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,700
hand are all things that you should be

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,079
looking for

31
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,210
there's also automated systems that

32
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,359
trommel system very common large

33
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,519
operations may hear the name twister to

34
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,859
name brand that's a one that makes a

35
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,228
very large scale trommel style pruners

36
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,659
and cutters that basically take raw

37
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,000
plant material and cut it down here to

38
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,530
the initial form of buds however just

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,180
because this is automated doesn't mean

40
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,909
that there isn't a need for QC or

41
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,380
quality control as a result automated

42
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,329
systems can get expensive and require

43
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,399
specific set of parameters so just the

44
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,679
angle and the feed rate and running of

45
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,630
those takes sometimes a little while to

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,159
get dialed in to work properly there is

47
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,228
a need for continual flow of blood so

48
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,420
high value material is required with

49
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,769
these automated systems you may still

50
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,149
need human eyes and hands to provide

51
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:49,589
some quality control do some last

52
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,329
trimming of things that got missed

53
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,310
typically its removal of crow's feet

54
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,078
which are the small leaves at the base

55
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,969
of the bud that the trommel may miss in

56
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,758
some cases she's one of the extra set of

57
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:02,188
eyes to go through so you can ensure at

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,060
the end you're sending out a quality and

59
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,059
consistent product
