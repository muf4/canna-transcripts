00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
if you're interested in learning more

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,450
about drip irrigation

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:14,558
this debacle university video is for you

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:16,239
[Music]

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,320
just as we see in the picture here let's

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,719
look at drip irrigation equipment for

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
outdoor cannabis production

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,320
so first off understanding with drip

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,118
irrigation is it can be

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,719
large scale or it can be small scale

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,480
it's important to know how many plants

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,159
you want to support with your system and

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
also what the layout of those plants

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,159
will be

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
because it will factor into the way you

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,359
design your system general

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
recommendations will be provided which

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,479
will include equipment

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
that is needed no matter the size of the

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,199
operation because whether you're small

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,320
scale or large scale

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
there's certain things with drip

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
irrigation you need to have

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,239
to make the system work properly so

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,198
first off what do you need we need a

26
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,558
filter

27
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,159
and there's high pressure filters which

28
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,519
will filter out dirt and other foreign

29
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,839
objects with a long

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,039
usable life span which is great having

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
stainless steel screen

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
and heavy reinforced frame allow for

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,478
reusability

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,079
and maximum durability and this is

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,039
important especially when out in a field

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,039
application

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
because you're going to be getting a lot

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
of stresses put on them

39
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,719
you don't want to have your filter fail

40
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,399
or break because you could jeopardize

41
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,759
the very small holes that you have in

42
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,359
your drip irrigation

43
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,040
keep in mind there are different sizes

44
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,920
and styles of filters allowing for the

45
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
proper one

46
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
to be selected for the intended

47
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,879
application that you have

48
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
and there are different mesh sizes

49
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,920
typically you'll find 155 or 200 mesh

50
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
filters

51
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,200
with the 200 mesh filter being the

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
recommendation

53
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
for drip irrigation applications so

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
others might be cheaper might be other

55
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,879
options

56
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,640
i'd recommend going with the 200 mesh if

57
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,879
you're looking at drip irrigation

58
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399
there are different flow rates so ensure

59
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,519
that the filter is not the restriction

60
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,359
on the system

61
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,118
and typically you can upsize the filter

62
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,599
but make sure you're matching it

63
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,200
with the size piping that you have for

64
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,039
your system

65
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
now with looking at the system we also

66
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,118
have a psi regulator

67
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,718
a pressure regulator essentially pounds

68
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,560
per square inch regulator

69
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,319
for drip irrigation 10 psi regular is

70
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
necessary to avoid blowing out the drip

71
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,878
lines and if you think you can get away

72
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
with it you might get away for a little

73
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,038
bit

74
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,879
but if you're going much over 10 you

75
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,119
risk

76
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,359
the chance of blowing up the lines and

77
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,560
it basically sounds like a gunshot so

78
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
definitely don't want to be breaking

79
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
your lines 10 psi is kind of

80
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,878
the psi recommendation getting one that

81
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,479
can operate under constant pressure is

82
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,679
recommended as well those tend to be a

83
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,959
little heavier duty

84
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,319
and it may cost a little bit more

85
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,280
initially but can be worth it in the

86
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,598
long run

87
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
ensure that the inlet and outlet sizes

88
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,479
match the pipe or tubing that you intend

89
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,479
on using

90
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,878
using and we can see the one pictured

91
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,079
right here a little bit of the internals

92
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,039
that did you need to be aware of all the

93
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,640
internals but

94
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,639
just so you know what is kind of going

95
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,878
on in that filter or that

96
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,559
regulator i should say so the mainline

97
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,158
tubing this is another very critical

98
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
area and we see that right here

99
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,479
very large in this case it can be black

100
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
it can be white doesn't really matter

101
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,759
but what is important is the diameter

102
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,359
because that will be based on

103
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,039
the needed flow rate that can be

104
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
supplied by the system

105
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,479
check the exact tubing you will use

106
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,079
because many main lines either are not

107
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,399
rated for use under constant

108
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,560
pressure so it must be installed after

109
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
automated timers or valves

110
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,039
and all tubing is normally sized meaning

111
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
there's no industry standard really

112
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,039
refer to the inside diameter or the

113
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,759
outside diameter the id of the od

114
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,959
measurements for the exact tubing size

115
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,039
now what we notice here with this

116
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,120
large oversized is this is allowing a

117
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,359
very large field to be supported

118
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,280
potentially by limiting the number of

119
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,000
valves that are needed or the number of

120
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,158
zones that are needed to be allocated

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
with drip irrigation there are important

122
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,479
fittings to be aware of so

123
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
drip irrigation does need proper

124
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,840
fittings to allow for proper connections

125
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,438
in delivery of water

126
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
key fittings apart from effective system

127
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,120
include what's called the tape lock barb

128
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,719
fitting as you can see here where this

129
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,719
gets punched into the main line

130
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,799
and then the drip tubing will attach

131
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,080
here now we can have it here with a

132
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,280
valve or we can just have it free

133
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
flowing

134
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,039
the drip tape end plug particularly

135
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,759
important with thicker mill ratings of

136
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,598
drip tape

137
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,759
and it can be a foldable type or kind of

138
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,120
a plug that goes in at the end

139
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,399
on thinner types some growers may

140
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
tighten a knot but this is a little more

141
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,078
professional looking

142
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,160
and offers a very consistent and really

143
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,879
eliminates water loss

144
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,479
there's again the grip sleeve end here

145
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,000
different versions most growers now are

146
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,519
going with this type here

147
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
and then there's the tape block coupler

148
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,399
which is basically what happens or what

149
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,919
you need to have on hand

150
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,679
when you hit the drip irrigation with a

151
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,159
sharp tool or break one of the lines

152
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,918
there

153
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,439
basically you cut this you cut the area

154
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,879
there splice this in

155
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,719
and your drip irrigation will flow as

156
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,319
normal there's also a valve

157
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,040
option if that's fitting for your

158
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,719
operation now the drip tape itself is

159
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,319
how the water is actually delivered and

160
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
thinking you can think of it as

161
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,360
precisely leaky hose

162
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,198
even it's a little bit more complicated

163
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
than that it does allow for controlled

164
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,840
amount of water to be delivered based on

165
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,439
calculations

166
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,038
there's another video here on debacu

167
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,478
university to go over that

168
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,079
the benefits of drip tape reason why

169
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,038
it's so popular is it's very efficient

170
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,359
at watering

171
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,120
allows for uniform water delivery the

172
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
material is durable and can last for

173
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,560
many years if you get the thicker

174
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
15 mil for example and it can resist

175
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,038
clogging

176
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
in particularly if you're using a filter

177
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,120
ahead of the irrigation

178
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,560
it can be used above or below ground as

179
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,918
well so it offers some different

180
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,600
installation methods

181
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,639
now i say precisely leaky hose it's a

182
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,400
little bit more complicated than just

183
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,038
taking a pin hole in poking holes in a

184
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,079
hose

185
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,800
there is some inter kind of turbulence

186
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,439
that occurs

187
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,079
that does help it allow it to run for

188
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,478
very long

189
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,519
distances now when we're looking at

190
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,680
installing our

191
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,359
drip tape and we're kind of uh

192
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,079
installing it to the main line

193
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
we want to have a punch or to be able to

194
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,038
allow those fittings

195
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,038
those barb fittings go into that main

196
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,879
line there's many options

197
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,478
options that can accomplish essentially

198
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,680
the same task however pictured here

199
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,279
right here is what's called the miracle

200
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
punch and it's highly recommended

201
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,519
because it allows for

202
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,280
minimum fatigue and consistent results

203
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,799
if you're making five holes or if you're

204
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,638
making five thousand holes

205
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,240
i've used this myself and i really think

206
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,079
it is the way to go

207
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
save it it'll last for many years and

208
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,159
does make the process much easier

209
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,600
then there's hold down stakes and while

210
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
technically these may not be needed if

211
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
you're

212
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
there's a long run of drip tape that's

213
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,679
not under a plastic cover or

214
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,038
another method of support using cold

215
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,079
down stakes is advised

216
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,439
because if you get a high wind

217
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,159
especially early in the season all your

218
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,399
drip tapes that were

219
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,919
actually nicely spaced out go through

220
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,719
and start to overlap and they start to

221
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,240
twine and

222
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
intermix with one another which just

223
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,439
causes a whole mess

224
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,519
look for features such as galvanized

225
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,360
fittings these um hold down stakes i

226
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,439
should say that are six inches long

227
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
and u-shaped the u-shaped are wind

228
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,120
stakes and they're stronger than just a

229
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,038
traditional like a candy cane j-hook

230
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
as they hold down especially well in

231
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,918
heavier soils

232
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,720
they're typically offered in packs of 10

233
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,639
or 100 you can always get a couple more

234
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
there and put them all on the line to

235
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,240
make them easier to recover at the end

236
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,639
of the season

237
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
additional items that you may need or

238
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,120
you could use i guess i should say would

239
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,800
be timers

240
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,639
and they are optional we see a bunch

241
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,079
listed here but they're highly

242
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,000
recommended especially for larger

243
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,279
operations to offer consistency of the

244
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,038
plants

245
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,399
because this can allow growers to be

246
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,079
make better decisions

247
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,918
about making irrigation adjustments

248
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,598
there are also many of these may be able

249
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,758
to hook up to rain sensors so

250
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,038
plants aren't getting overly irrigated

251
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
with water

252
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,279
the basics had a setup here these

253
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,199
systems can differ yours may differ

254
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,198
but the basics are still the same it can

255
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
come down to the source of grower uses

256
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,639
and what they want the end result to be

257
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,598
you simply have that initial

258
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,360
water you have a timer potentially you

259
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,878
can have a backflow preventer

260
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,199
you want to have a filter or pressure

261
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,120
reducer as well fertilizer injector

262
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
is optional but recommended again and

263
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
then this connection to the header which

264
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,359
is in the main line there

265
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,878
so this is kind of just that basic kind

266
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,439
of simplified system

267
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,879
don't be kind of hesitant to adopt a

268
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,240
drip irrigation system because there's

269
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,919
new fittings there's different

270
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
components that are needed hopefully

271
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,240
this breaks it down it doesn't make it

272
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,318
quite as intimidating and allows you to

273
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,439
adopt this method for your own

274
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
irrigation setup

275
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,719
because your plants will like it and you

276
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
will like it once you get it all set up

277
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,199
because it's a very efficient

278
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
method it offers great consistency for

279
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
you

280
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,799
and the plants
