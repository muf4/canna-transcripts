1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,599
many times you hear the importance of

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,278
scouting your plants

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,120
well here i want to go through on this

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,280
debaco university video

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
provide you with the procedure to how

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,359
properly to go about scouting your

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,439
cannabis plants for any potential

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,519
problems so you can catch them early

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:21,039
and implement control measures before

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,039
the problem gets out of hand

11
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:28,879
[Music]

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,320
all right let's go over the procedure

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,919
for scouting cannabis plants for

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,238
potential problems

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,679
so know what the normal looks like this

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,558
is an important very first step what

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,960
should your plants

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,799
look like this pertains to the obvious

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
above ground portions of the plant

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,238
but do not also forget about the below

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
ground portions of the plant

22
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,159
they may say oh yeah the leaves need to

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
be green well some cultivars some

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,359
varieties

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,959
might have a lighter green coloration

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,000
might have more anthocyanins more purple

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
coloration

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,119
so just keep in mind to know what the

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,120
normal for your particular

30
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,358
plant that you're growing what it looks

31
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,558
like so you know if things are outside

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
of what the normal is expected to be

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,319
also know what is common well and this

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,879
is before you go and inspect

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,199
know what you're likely to find keep an

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,359
open eye but there can be some expected

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
issues as plants age and in the

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,478
particular growing environment

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,240
for example if you're late in the season

40
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,118
in the fall outdoor growing or even

41
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,118
indoor growing

42
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,400
powdery mildew might be of increased

43
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,159
odds

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
so things to consider of know what to

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,880
expect but also

46
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,000
expect as always the unexpected

47
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,000
no one is hot this year so for example

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
every year there's a certain disease or

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
an insect that might be

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
very prevalent particularly for outdoor

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,519
locations try to get an

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,280
idea what others might be seeing this

53
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,759
will help provide some hints on what you

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,439
should be

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,519
especially on the lookout for that

56
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,719
particular year and i still people

57
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,679
in the at the end of the year i can

58
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,438
always tell you what we should have been

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
looking out for but each year

60
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,718
there's always seems like there's

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
something that is hot that year

62
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,718
something that is really prevalent that

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
year and it could be based on weather

64
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,000
or weather patterns temperature things

65
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
like that

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
and this leads us to the disease

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,598
triangle so understanding this you need

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
to have the pathogen present

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,799
you need to have the environment you

70
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
have the host plant and they need

71
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,719
all three need to interact for a period

72
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,560
of time to get disease

73
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,159
now the pathogen can be fungus bacterium

74
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,598
or virus the environment

75
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,199
is going to be what conditions are

76
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,560
favorable for disease development you

77
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,359
need a host which is a plant that can

78
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,878
get sick

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
and you need you need that disease

80
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,199
triangle then they all interact with one

81
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,878
another

82
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,238
if you only have two of them you run the

83
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,598
risk of having that

84
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,200
but when you have all three come

85
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,000
together that's we get the full-blown

86
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,839
disease or

87
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,439
issue and that's you're trying to break

88
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
the sides of the triangle here to

89
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,680
prevent your plants

90
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,598
from expressing that particular disease

91
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
so what's some basic list of equipment

92
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,318
that you need to go through when you go

93
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,239
through scouting

94
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,359
well a map if you're inspecting large

95
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,400
areas or

96
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,160
multiple fields pen or pencil and paper

97
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
to write down any notes you see

98
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,000
hand lens for inspecting uh for

99
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
potential small insects or looking at

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,878
really detailed things

101
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,959
pocket knife potentially cutting into

102
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,239
plant portions bags if you're going to

103
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,640
be collecting samples

104
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,239
and a camera now if you have other

105
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,679
equipment all the better for example a

106
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
lot some growers are usually using

107
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
drones for very scouting very large

108
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,000
areas

109
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
that would be a great option but these

110
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,959
are kind of like the basics that you

111
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,159
would need to ensure you can do an

112
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,439
effective scouting

113
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,239
of your plants also when you want to

114
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,239
consider the

115
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,439
recent events for outdoor you want to be

116
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
looking at the weather what was the

117
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,280
weather what's the weather predicted to

118
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,920
be

119
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
that can influence what you might find

120
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,878
for indoor environment know what

121
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,519
treatments that the plants were given

122
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,598
and also what conditions and data

123
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,039
loggers here last 24 hours or so

124
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,719
what conditions were those plants

125
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,000
exposed to

126
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,158
then we're talking about scouting

127
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,439
patterns as in a lot of plants girls not

128
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,439
to follow a single row

129
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,120
but to get an overview of the area now

130
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,598
that can be kind of a transient kind of

131
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,959
look a zigzag scouting a diamond pattern

132
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,719
if you've got to get back to the same

133
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,158
point so just keep in mind you don't

134
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,959
want to just go down one row because

135
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,519
that might give you

136
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,000
a kind of an uneven look or kind of a

137
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,400
bias

138
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,598
to your scouting and you want to

139
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
evaluate the plants

140
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,039
so consider the entire group of plants

141
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,839
as well as individual plants look for

142
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,280
patterns

143
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,878
it could be more difficult we only have

144
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
a small number of plants that might be

145
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,680
quite large

146
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,519
but in the larger area here we have much

147
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,799
more plants look for any sort of

148
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
patterns that you see

149
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,319
what are some consistencies one end of

150
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,759
the field look different than another

151
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,399
go through as part of your hopefully

152
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
unbiased evaluation then you want to

153
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,839
classify the issue

154
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,039
so is it random are only a few plants

155
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,119
here and there showing

156
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,439
whatever you're noticing could it also

157
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
be on different portions of plants

158
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,680
so it's going to be at the top of these

159
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
plants the bottom of those plants the

160
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,319
midsections

161
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
this is typically a sign of early

162
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,319
insects but it could be other things

163
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,000
if you're seeing aggregated areas issues

164
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,478
found in groups or sections

165
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,319
pockets of similarities would be noticed

166
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,120
typically associated with a soil issue

167
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,759
or disease

168
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,199
and or water excessive water instead of

169
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,120
kind of a dry pocket

170
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
or it could be a really wet area that's

171
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,439
typically seen these aggregated groups

172
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
this kind of

173
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
see here took all the plants random

174
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
which is going to be random throughout

175
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,399
aggregated being little clumps now

176
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,720
there's

177
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,239
aggregated versus the repeated so

178
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,000
aggregated again could it be down a

179
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
slope could be a little depression here

180
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,079
collecting water could be aggregated to

181
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,960
the edge of a field maybe did

182
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,399
did a fertilizer row get missed or is it

183
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,399
repeated is it only down

184
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,000
certain rows in a certain area did

185
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,839
something happen in that particular area

186
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
is it a low spot a high spot

187
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,198
what did the tractor went through and

188
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
fertilized you know over fertilizer

189
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,319
under fertilize this particularly to

190
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,319
have a skip in this particular section

191
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,560
again all things to be looking for all

192
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,159
things to be documenting

193
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,240
and how do you document well simply by

194
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
taking pictures this can involve a

195
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
general

196
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,519
field images as well as individual

197
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,199
plants portions of interest are valuable

198
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,038
but sometimes having the larger image

199
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
can also be helpful so for example we

200
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,680
take a picture of this yelling leaf yes

201
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,439
this leaf is yellow

202
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
we look at the whole plant establishment

203
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,918
in general is it just one leaf is it

204
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
just one

205
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,318
area on one plant is it not all the

206
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,639
leaves of the same age across

207
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,800
all the multiple growing environments

208
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
and growing sections and growing rows

209
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,879
all that plays into developing an

210
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
accurate diagnosis

211
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,439
now if you're not able to diagnose in

212
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
the field or want to get a little bit

213
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,120
more information

214
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,758
sometimes collecting a sample is

215
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,759
important

216
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,600
i want to be sure to click the clean and

217
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
early symptoms and advanced

218
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
portions of plant symptoms so that clean

219
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
sample is something that really doesn't

220
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,240
look infected or look like it

221
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
has any issues you want to collect a

222
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
portion of that because sometimes in the

223
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,079
lab

224
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,478
they might be able to see that very

225
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,079
early onsite of something then early

226
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,680
symptoms something's not too advanced it

227
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,038
hasn't really broken down

228
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,038
just starting where you're first able to

229
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:41,680
detect the issue and then advanced

230
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,199
symptoms

231
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,038
as well should be included in your

232
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,240
sample if you're collecting roots be

233
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,038
sure to collect them with the soil

234
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
around them

235
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,800
for analysis in the lab because that may

236
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
also play into the material that's

237
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
needed

238
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,879
when in doubt contact the lab as far as

239
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,879
what sample they want to collect for

240
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,478
what you suspect to ensure that you're

241
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,959
sending a quality sample

242
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,399
so hopefully you'll get a quality result

243
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,799
because remember the lab

244
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,439
is only as good as the sample you send

245
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,439
them
