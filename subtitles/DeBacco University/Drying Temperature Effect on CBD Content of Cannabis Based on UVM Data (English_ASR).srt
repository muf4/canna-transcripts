1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,640
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,318
going to be looking at some research

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,199
presented by the university of vermont

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,919
extension

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,359
looking at hemp cannabidiol drying trial

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,960
so hopefully you can follow along and

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,439
learn some information

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
here on the research presented and then

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,358
if you want to learn about it in more

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,118
detail

11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,960
links will be provided in the video so

12
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,920
you can look at the full trial its full

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:31,760
details

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:33,120
if you so choose

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
all right let's get into the drying

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,159
temperature effect on cbd content

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,359
of cannabis based on the uvm data and

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,718
that's the university of vermont

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,320
extension here

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,640
so if you're looking for the actual

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,719
original publication this is the

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
exact link here welcome to take a look

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
at it i'll provide with a brief overview

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
in this video lecture so first off dryer

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
temperature

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,718
humidity and harvest moisture so here

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,079
we're looking at some of the data

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
presented and at harvest

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,439
the moisture of the flower buds was

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
statistically similar which

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,920
generally would make sense the average

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,799
actual temperature and relative humidity

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,040
for each treatment

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,720
indicated that the 105 fahrenheit

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
treatment dryer with the buds did not

36
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,400
reach 105 degrees fahrenheit

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,798
what does that mean if we look here at

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,640
the data actual temperature we could see

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,360
that they had it set for 105 degrees

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
fahrenheit

41
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,599
but only got it up to 86.4 was the

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
average actual temperature they did note

43
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,000
in the research they had some issues

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
with this particular

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,759
drying oven it was unclear why the dryer

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,519
was unable to maintain

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,920
a consistent temperature over the drying

48
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,280
period this is what happens in science

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,719
the dryer had an average temperature

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,879
that was only seven degrees higher than

51
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,319
the drying treatment at 80 degrees

52
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,239
fahrenheit there so something went wrong

53
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,078
with that particular dryer but does not

54
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,920
mean all the data here is null and void

55
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,078
there's actually some usable data here

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,799
when drying the bud and stems this is

57
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,559
bun and stems at 105 degrees fahrenheit

58
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
dryer did not reach its average

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
temperature until after seven

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,280
hours and fluctuated the most in

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
temperature

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
in the first three hours as it warmed up

63
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
although

64
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
after the first seven hours we made more

65
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,118
consistent temperature this is another

66
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,959
important

67
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,959
kind of data point information to

68
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,878
provide in the sense that it does take

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
some time to warm up and initially

70
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,039
it might be some more fluctuations here

71
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,719
that growers need to be aware of

72
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,318
however the 80 degree dryer did not have

73
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,800
this problem in temperatures

74
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,159
near 80 degrees fahrenheit right away so

75
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
if it's just something with these

76
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,680
warmer temperatures they noted uh the

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
changes there that's what's also

78
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,719
important science

79
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,239
to kind of document what happens even

80
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,199
though it may not go as intended to

81
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
document that

82
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,199
just so you have a better understanding

83
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,119
of the data when it's presented

84
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,318
then we also have the average relative

85
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
humidity presented

86
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,159
and the harvest moisture presented here

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,000
as well so hourly

88
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,280
bud only temperature in humidity and

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,039
they were looking at the buds only and

90
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
then the buds and the stems

91
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,159
so hourly temperature and relative

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
humidities for the buds only experiments

93
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,719
presented here

94
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,719
here we have the temperature in

95
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,280
fahrenheit and then we have the time

96
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,959
here

97
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,199
and we have the different colors um

98
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
shown here extending out we could see

99
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,479
that there's an overall decrease in the

100
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,360
ambient relative humidity

101
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,158
over the time ambient temperature and

102
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
the

103
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,239
80 degree fahrenheit drier humidity and

104
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
temperature so here's the humidity

105
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,560
here's the temperature very consistent

106
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,480
and then here's the temperature for 105

107
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,598
and the relative humidity here we can

108
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,399
definitely see

109
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,079
based on our data points that the 105

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,000
drier relative humidity

111
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,840
decreased to a much greater

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
level there as the temperature came down

113
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
so we got relative humidities here

114
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,519
temperatures here

115
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
see that relative humidity definitely

116
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,519
came down quicker at the 105 degrees

117
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,439
compared to the 80 degrees

118
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
is that necessarily better we'll see

119
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,039
later but that's at least

120
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,238
quick overview of what this data table

121
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,000
is showing then

122
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
they looked at the hourly bud and stem

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,158
temperature related to relative humidity

124
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,480
so the bud

125
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,840
and stem experiment average drier

126
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,039
temperature were approximate to the

127
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,319
desired temperatures

128
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,878
in the hourly temperatures and

129
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,158
humidities so again here we're seeing

130
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,878
temperature here very consistent at 80

131
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,079
temperature for 105 we'd expect it to be

132
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,598
somewhere right around here because it

133
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
did fluctuate a little bit

134
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,759
then the relative humidity here of the

135
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,719
80 degree temperature

136
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,560
decreased 105 definitely decreased much

137
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,598
quicker here and relative humidity

138
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
so when we're looking at the total

139
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,478
potential cbd here looking at the data

140
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,399
table

141
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,079
uh presented we have the treatment the

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,478
bud's only potential cbd

143
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,560
buds in stem potential and then trial

144
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,039
total potential cbd percentage

145
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
so in the buds only study uh keep in

146
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
mind this is about its only

147
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
column right here the ambient

148
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,040
temperature resulted in significantly

149
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,519
higher total potential cbd

150
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
than drying buds at 105 degrees

151
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,120
fahrenheit

152
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,079
so here we have a 7.71 percentage

153
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,399
compared to only a 5.88 percentage point

154
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,918
here the total potential cbd of the buds

155
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,959
dried at 80 degrees fahrenheit did not

156
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,560
significantly differ

157
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,239
from the higher and lower temperature

158
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
treatments and resulted in cbd

159
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,840
percentages between

160
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,199
the two extremes so here's the ambient

161
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,799
temperature and then here's

162
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,478
80 degrees fahrenheit it was a little

163
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
bit less but not

164
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,560
majorly less and even when they looked

165
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,038
at the stats when drying blood and stem

166
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,639
materials

167
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,159
look at this column here there was no

168
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,160
significant difference between the cbd

169
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,680
concentrations of 105

170
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,720
and 80 degrees fahrenheit so that's a

171
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,319
kind of important little

172
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,400
note there and this study should be

173
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,680
repeated because of the issues that they

174
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,879
had with the dryers maintaining

175
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
consistent temperatures

176
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,199
so again just keep that in mind um there

177
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,038
but we are noticing some initial data

178
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,038
that there could be differences here

179
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,038
notice with the different temperatures

180
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,478
so this kind of gets into the speed

181
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,759
versus quality

182
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,519
kind of concept or idea while the

183
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,840
use of higher temperatures results in

184
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,359
faster drying times we stop the graph

185
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,038
impact of drying temperatures on the

186
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
quality of their product should be taken

187
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,079
into consideration

188
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
in this trial drying at a higher

189
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,680
temperature above 80 degrees fahrenheit

190
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
resulted in significantly lower

191
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
total potential cbd concentrations so

192
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,038
it's important to remember that this is

193
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
only one year of data limited

194
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,318
replications and drying capacity

195
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,840
further research is needed and this

196
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,120
trial should be replicated with dryers

197
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,719
that are more accurate

198
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,120
but it gets into the concept of speed

199
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,240
versus quality the faster

200
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,038
you go the less quality you you might be

201
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,560
getting so again

202
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,478
speed versus quality something to keep

203
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,478
in mind so looking at the data here

204
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,918
ambient or 80 degrees fahrenheit would

205
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,439
be kind of the maximum

206
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,680
i wouldn't want to go much more than

207
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,079
that even though it might

208
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,680
quicken up the speeding the process of

209
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,560
the drying might speed up the drying

210
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
process

211
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,759
you don't want to sacrifice your quality

212
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
that you've been trying to grow and

213
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,479
perfect through the entire growing

214
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,959
season at the very end

215
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,120
just to make the drying times less this

216
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,719
is just some data here to support that

217
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,478
that you're looking at 80 degrees or

218
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
less really trying probably for that

219
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,279
more 60 degrees fahrenheit to be the

220
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,959
quality target

221
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,758
going much more than that yeah it'll dry

222
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,758
faster but at the risk to quality
