1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,349
alright here I'm going to go over some

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,400
of the details regarding gene

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,009
architecture

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,150
what's gene what's it comprised of how

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,570
is it organized

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,240
what are components to a gene to help

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,519
cells function so let's get into it here

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,469
so first off the obvious question is

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,019
just you know what is a gene how do we

10
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,899
define a gene well

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,359
a gene is kind of the work of some

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,778
scientists that basically determined

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,640
that genes reside in chromosomes so

14
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:35,729
chromosomes contain proteins known as

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,370
histones in DNA so within the chromosome

16
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,919
here little X you have that condensed

17
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,289
form of DNA so here's again here's our

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,469
DNA and these little green circles are

19
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:49,200
histones so the question was what is the

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,579
hereditary material is it the protein or

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,800
is it the DNA here so when we're looking

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,320
specifically at those histones that

23
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,169
protein structure that helps organize

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,480
the DNA those systems are actually very

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,390
important so while the other chromosome

26
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,000
we have our chromatin we have our DNA

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,890
and then we have those histones well

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,049
think of this if we have this very long

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,750
piece of string it's very easy for it to

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,640
get tangled there for histones our

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,790
little protein structures that allow

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,409
that DNA to kind of like wrap around to

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,420
help keep it organized we see a kind of

34
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,950
wrapping around here it's kind of calls

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,350
like balls on a chain kind of all kind

36
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,609
of a way to nicely condense the DNA

37
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,780
instead of just taking a large piece of

38
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,030
string there's kind of cream and all

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,118
together to kind of all rats nests there

40
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,840
this is a very organized way to be able

41
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,450
to keep that DNA together organized and

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,368
condensed for the process of cell

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,019
division this one's actually have other

44
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:47,578
purposes here but here we're just

45
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,879
looking at the fact that they organize

46
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,559
in DNA now within those systems this

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,539
gives you another kind of image or

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,939
picture of how it looks here's our

49
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,380
chromosome here's our within our nucleus

50
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:04,139
here's our DNA and then here's our

51
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:06,118
histones these little blue spheres here

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,409
now when it says silent and active the

53
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:08,969
sound is kind of like taking all those

54
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,219
fears and kind of condensing them and

55
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,068
keeping them tightly packed very hard

56
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,408
for other mechanisms to get in there

57
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:17,060
kind of Express those genes here the

58
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:19,158
active form we see it more spaced out

59
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,188
greater space that's allowing for these

60
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:24,679
genes to be active or turned on so these

61
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:27,590
histones help that organization of that

62
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,829
DNA into potentially an active or a

63
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,438
silent or inactive form and we're

64
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:35,180
looking at the architecture of a gene in

65
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:37,608
general you know how do they kind of

66
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,139
look well we have that DNA which is very

67
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:41,239
important and we're speaking here in

68
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,849
eukaryotes genes are basically

69
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,209
fragmented and they're composed of two

70
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:49,548
components exons and introns I don't

71
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,370
know why they named them this way but

72
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,950
the exons are sequences that code for

73
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,870
amino acids in the introns don't have

74
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,518
any coding regions so if you look at our

75
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,590
DNA here and then we're going to RNA in

76
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,950
our mRNA ultimately want to take that

77
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,759
full-length DNA composed of exons and

78
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:10,848
introns now only the exons are kept and

79
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,668
we see that in our final messenger RNA

80
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:16,310
here so exons a lot of people think oh

81
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:19,370
they exit now exons are kept together

82
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,439
they are the coding regions it is the

83
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,129
introns that don't the introns are

84
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:28,039
spliced out so we could see here's our

85
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:30,289
total DNA sequence here's our RNA and

86
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,448
our messenger RNA will only be composed

87
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:34,158
of those exons part of the reason is

88
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:36,260
this if there's a mutation or

89
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,658
a nucleotide base that's an error

90
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:40,608
hopefully it falls in one of the intron

91
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:42,739
areas it's spliced out and doesn't have

92
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,049
to worry this way the cells that have to

93
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,780
make necessarily every single nucleotide

94
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,699
pairing and match up be absolutely

95
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,919
critical otherwise one little flip would

96
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:55,909
cause a major mutation here there are

97
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,799
some basically non-coding regions as

98
00:03:55,908 --> 00:04:00,679
architecture of the gene again speaking

99
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,680
for eukaryotic cells they transcribe the

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,719
entire gene producing a primary RNA

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,250
transcript this transcript is ends

102
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,219
heavily processed to produce mature

103
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,709
messenger RNA transcript the mRNA leaves

104
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,930
a nucleus for the cytoplasm so what does

105
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,598
this mean our primary RNA transcript has

106
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,788
the exons in the introns there's an RNA

107
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:22,158
processing that occurs and that will

108
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:24,860
basically splice out those introns and

109
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:26,219
only the exons will be left into that

110
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,930
final messenger

111
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,000
our announcer then sent out to the cell

112
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,420
there's a five prime cap in a poly a

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,930
tail also added after it's spliced as

114
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:40,890
well so if we're looking here we want to

115
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,079
notice the locations of everything so we

116
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,360
have up here the gene contains both

117
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,629
exons and introns that's the full DNA

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,990
now the RNA is processed to remove the

119
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:56,189
introns that final process located over

120
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:59,460
here is the messenger RNA that messenger

121
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:02,040
RNA will only contain the exons and this

122
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,979
mature messenger RNA M stands for

123
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,050
messenger so mature messenger RNA mature

124
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,870
mRNA travels to the cytoplasm what's

125
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,420
responsible for the synthesizing of

126
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,560
important proteins for the body now what

127
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,449
does this look like while alternating

128
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,920
splicing here we have this kind of

129
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,779
combination produces three different

130
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,819
proteins at the same section of DNA

131
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,519
notice the alteration of the order of

132
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,168
the exons so the exons are the coding

133
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,689
regions well in this case we have five

134
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:29,149
exons here we have the RNA with the five

135
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,019
exons and also the introns

136
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:33,149
single-stranded versus double-stranded

137
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,209
we have alternate splicing what does

138
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:39,179
this mean well love these five exons in

139
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:41,159
this first protein protein a we have

140
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,860
them in exon order one two three four

141
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,600
five makes sense is how its presented

142
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,910
however alternate splicing was if we

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,270
take those same exons and we mix the

144
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,979
order up in this case we have only exons

145
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,689
one two four and five we're missing

146
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,089
number three that's going to create a

147
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,978
different protein here we have one two

148
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,599
three and five we took number four out

149
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,909
and you can see a different protein this

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,350
is the way that I'm cells or DNA can

151
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:09,450
conserve the amount of new DNA sequences

152
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,610
just simply mixing the order up will

153
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,849
change the proteins and vastly change

154
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,000
the function now processing you carry

155
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,220
mRNA through RNA splicing was this occur

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,810
well different combinations of exons can

157
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,790
generate different polypeptides via

158
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,649
alternate splicing we just saw that in a

159
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,840
previous slide there where we have our

160
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:30,539
pre messenger RNA and through different

161
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,209
splicing and different combinations of

162
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,580
those exons if an order all those exons

163
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,549
will create different end products in

164
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:41,689
this case polypeptides known as

165
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,980
genes that the promoter region in a DNA

166
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:44,660
sequence it's the region of DNA that

167
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,970
initiates the transcription of a gene

168
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,070
the promoter is kind of like the on or

169
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,870
off switch to a light it's located

170
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:54,110
towards a five-prime end and it will

171
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,750
initiate or allow that kind of coding

172
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:02,840
region to then be basically expressed or

173
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,519
transit into our RNA sequence here now

174
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,500
the architecture of a gene so kind of

175
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,240
title here well it's a segment of DNA

176
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,699
located on the chromosome that contains

177
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,800
instructions for protein production so

178
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,509
just looking at chromosome from parent

179
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,730
one and parent two well there'll be a

180
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:19,189
certain locus a certain region for

181
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,840
height for example in this case we're

182
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,370
looking at peas looking at Gregor Mendel

183
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,409
if you're looking at pea pods whether

184
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,160
it'll be wrinkled or smooth in that

185
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:32,810
locus be the locus or the section of

186
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,460
gene for the architecture within these

187
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,129
general pea pod whether it be a smooth

188
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:40,430
pea pod or a wrinkled to pupa and again

189
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:42,379
this if we look at the big chromosome

190
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,629
here we look at that in a more detail

191
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,560
level will see those histones ultimately

192
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:51,589
to that DNA level of introns and exons

193
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,939
composing of the gene now lastly here

194
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,189
just controlling the gene getting

195
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,110
whether it's get turned on or it's gets

196
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,660
turned off well the genes are typically

197
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,770
controlled at the level of transcription

198
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,810
sis so the cells not going to waste

199
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:05,750
energy and procreates proteins are

200
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,430
either blocked to allow RNA polymerase

201
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,009
to access the promoter or they're

202
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,689
repressed so repressors will block the

203
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,759
promoter region that kind of on-and-off

204
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,649
switch like someone puts a cover over

205
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,170
the on/off switch won't be able to turn

206
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:20,149
that light on activators that make the

207
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,560
porter more accessible maybe it's kind

208
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,120
of like a nightlight over the light

209
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,370
switch to make it easier to find in the

210
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,470
dark most genes are turned off except

211
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,540
when needed the cells have a lot of

212
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,090
genes and the whole point is not to have

213
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,590
them all on at the same time so we can

214
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,990
see here just some examples

215
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,300
looking at our prokaryotes if where they

216
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,360
have different food sources so low

217
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,490
glucose and lactose is available well in

218
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,320
this case we're having that activator go

219
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,060
right through and make these genes the

220
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,890
case here where high glucose and lactose

221
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,319
is unavailable we're going to repress

222
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,460
those particular genes

223
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,800
and we see the same thing here we're

224
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,240
lactose is unavailable we're lactose is

225
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,819
available we're having some level of

226
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,759
expression this is a get the lock operon

227
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,790
in prokaryotes so looking at activating

228
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,169
these lac genes if lactose is not

229
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:08,329
available there's no point in running

230
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:11,120
that or having the cell go through the

231
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,100
process of expressing those genes

232
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,289
therefore that promoter region will be

233
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,870
repressed and those genes will be

234
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:19,789
essentially turned off so hopefully this

235
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,860
gives you a nice little background here

236
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:24,110
of gene architecture to give you a

237
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,490
little insight into the complexities

238
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,490
going on within cells
