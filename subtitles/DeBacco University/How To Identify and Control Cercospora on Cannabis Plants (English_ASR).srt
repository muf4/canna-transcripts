00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,198
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
going to give you a brief

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:09,039
overview of how to identify and control

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,039
cercospora in cannabis plants

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,920
[Music]

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,759
so circo's not unique just to cannabis

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,080
but this is kind of what it looks like

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,679
in cannabis and on a microscopic view

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,518
this kind of looks like this long

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,198
straight little like thread almost or

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,399
worm looking like thing

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,480
so first off how do you go about

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,600
properly identifying in

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
cannabis plants well it starts as kind

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,960
of small

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,078
yellow flecks developing into lesions

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
which turn into light

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,120
tan or white with yellow halos

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
and in severe cases it develops

20
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,399
chlorosis leading to defoliation as we

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
see down here

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,960
the infection begins on older leaves and

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,558
moves through the canopy from there

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,558
general conditions of the fungi is that

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,280
the pathogen survives mainly in plant

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,399
debris

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,960
as desiccated resistant pseudomonas but

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
can also survive as canadia in debris or

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
seeds

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,000
since multiple regions where it can hide

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,079
when moisture is sufficient new canadia

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,478
are formed and spread via rain splash or

33
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,359
wind

34
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,799
to to new leaves or plants and that's

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,519
how it's spreading

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,118
optimum conditions are 77 to 95 degrees

37
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,118
fahrenheit with nighttime temperatures

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,840
above 61 degrees fahrenheit

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,799
and a relative humidity of 90 to 95

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
percent

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,240
infection is greatly reduced or

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,759
non-existent at temperatures less than

43
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,519
59 degrees fahrenheit

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,079
or during periods of leaf wetness that

45
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,280
are less than 11 hours

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,039
so if you're looking at kind of beating

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,478
back the disease and you have control

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,920
over conditions well not great for

49
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,078
growing the plant below 59 can really

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,439
reduce or really eliminate its chance of

51
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,118
spreading

52
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,879
so what about the life cycle as with any

53
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,200
disease good to understand the general

54
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,359
life cycle and we can see those kind of

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,478
finger like thread like uh protrusions

56
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,560
there

57
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,399
that are the leading to the canadian

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
which is the primary inoculum

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,159
they have our healthy plants we can have

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,079
our leaf spots we can have secondary

61
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
inoculum kind of infecting that way

62
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,359
we get infected plants that then lead to

63
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,039
infected debris

64
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,439
and the stroma is surviving an infected

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,560
plant to ruin soil where it resides

66
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,919
and then the stronghold producing can

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,598
spores can then go through and cause

68
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,719
that primary infection and repeat that

69
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,039
life cycle

70
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,959
here we see the same thing where we have

71
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,039
our disease develops as the leaves

72
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,159
appear as leathery dark kind of bronzy

73
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,280
colorations

74
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,439
we have the disease can cause a

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
defoliation those leaves fall the ground

76
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,520
and that's where this fungus will

77
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,799
survive

78
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
it's particularly looking in soybeans

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
but the same basic process occurs in

80
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,878
cannabis

81
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,039
wind or rain can spread spores to young

82
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,878
plants and then the fungal toxin

83
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,479
and sunlight interact causing the petrol

84
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,560
foliar symptoms as we see

85
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,318
here and a repeat of the cycle again

86
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,560
now how do we manage this and this is

87
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,238
showing it in some other plants as well

88
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,759
but identifying and developing resistant

89
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,719
varieties will be important going

90
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,479
forward

91
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,080
three-year rotation in outdoor fields

92
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,280
that have had a positive identification

93
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
of the fungus

94
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
avoid planting sugar beets near cannabis

95
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,439
because they definitely are more prone

96
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,879
to this

97
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,199
and that could potentially cause an

98
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,120
increase in the local pressure

99
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,439
so be mindful of what it is what it

100
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
looks like how to identify it

101
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,878
may not have be able to identify in the

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,800
microscopic level

103
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,799
but hopefully these descriptions as well

104
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,319
as macroscopic pictures provide you with

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
a little bit of understanding

106
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,919
and you can kind of hopefully not plant

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,560
sugar beets near the area

108
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,000
rotate if you can and try as a way of

109
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
methods of

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
management to mitigate the negative

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,360
impacts surcospera can have

112
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
on your cannabis plants
