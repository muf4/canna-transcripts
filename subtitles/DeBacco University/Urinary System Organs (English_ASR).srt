1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay here we're look at urine area

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,699
system organs the organs involved tied

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:11,339
in directly with the urinary system here

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,830
so starting with the basic organization

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,109
of the urinary system so we have our

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,509
kidneys it is an important component of

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,699
filtering the blood we also have the

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,368
urinary bladder this provides temporary

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,350
storage reservoir for the urine we also

10
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,759
have paired ureters here the reason why

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,800
they're paired because they're

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,080
transporting urine from the kidneys to

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,340
the bladder unless we have the urethra

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,769
which is transferring the urine from the

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,980
bladder and having it excrete or go

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,320
outside of the body in addition we also

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,390
have our kidneys which is an important

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,909
component of the urinary system because

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,770
it produces the urine it has awesome

20
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,109
main structures here called the renal

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,270
cortex the renal medulla the renal

22
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,759
pelvis and the nephrons I have a

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,489
separate video on the nephrons and those

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,558
are the actual functional units of the

25
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,328
kidney this is what they look like you

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,308
may have heard of kidney beans because

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,349
they have this kidney like shape to them

28
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:07,469
this that there's a lot of blood vessels

29
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:10,559
entering and capillaries going on that's

30
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:13,170
important because this is the main site

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,540
of filtration for the blood you also

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,430
have two kidneys even though you only

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,868
need one to survive so you often hear

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,000
people donating a kidney and are still

35
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,040
able to survive because your body has

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,200
kind of redundancies and backups

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,330
just giving you an indication of how

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,310
important the kidney actually is if two

39
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,109
of them case wants to fail your body

40
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,560
still wants to have another they can

41
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:36,930
survive them quit facts about the

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,570
kidneys they filter 200 liters of blood

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,579
daily allowing toxins metabolic wastes

44
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,709
and excessive ions to leave the body in

45
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,688
the urine through the ones or this site

46
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,459
of the actual filter that's taking

47
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,539
things out of the blood and inserting

48
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,390
them into the urine so they can be

49
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,700
excreted from the body approximately 1/4

50
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,618
or about 1000 to our Millers a systemic

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,020
cardiac output flows through the kidneys

52
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,879
each minute so it's a pretty intense

53
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,399
amount that's why we have so many

54
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,949
capillaries here is so many sites to

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,810
allow this exchange to occur all the

56
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,789
blood in your body is filtered about 60

57
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,649
times a day which means about two and a

58
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,628
half times every hour through your

59
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,620
kidneys that's why it's important for

60
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,689
your body to help

61
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,750
eliminate those toxins that are building

62
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:21,568
up and store them in the urine so they

63
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,269
can be excreted from the body the urine

64
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,699
itself the formation of that is it for

65
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,370
filtering actually the plasmas of the

66
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,988
blood so a plasma is the majority it's

67
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,939
fifty five percent this is again

68
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,709
occurring about sixty times a day so

69
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,389
it's actually being filtered the

70
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,150
filtrate contains all plasma components

71
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,518
except protein and loses water nutrients

72
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,500
and excessive ions to become urine

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,200
during contains metabolic wastes that

74
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,969
are unneeded substances now based on the

75
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,189
color of the yarn to determine the

76
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:53,098
degree of hydration or dehydration of an

77
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:55,109
individual if we're looking at more of

78
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:56,699
that darker yellow color be more

79
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,230
dehydrated looking at that lighter

80
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,539
yellow most clear color would be a

81
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,859
hydrated person call the years

82
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,000
determined mostly by the breakdown of

83
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,099
products their red blood cell

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,900
destruction the heme of hemoglobin is

85
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,939
converted by the liver into water Seibel

86
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,060
forms it may excreted into bile and

87
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:16,019
indirectly into the urine and the urine

88
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,239
the yellow pigment of urine is your uric

89
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:22,379
row their urine contains some ammonia

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,750
which is very toxic but as we learned in

91
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,750
another video that they're also body

92
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,639
converts it to urea a less toxic form in

93
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,650
the body would rather excrete the urine

94
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,290
in the form of the nitrogen from his

95
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,370
urea in the urine rather than ammonia if

96
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,798
you have high amounts of money it will

97
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,969
have a strong odor to it you can see

98
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,010
there's also other things phosphate

99
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:43,979
chlorides magnesium potassium and so on

100
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:48,019
so for ions as part of the earth however

101
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:50,399
the vast majority of urine is water

102
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,200
lastly the bladder it's the earning

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,810
bladder collects urine from both ureters

104
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,449
and from the kidneys the bladder is

105
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,859
largely

106
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:01,828
retroperitoneal which means even hold up

107
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,530
about 500 certain millions of urine and

108
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:09,120
this electric perineal a lot a bit of

109
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,430
change sizes so it can go larger as its

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,620
as more urine has been accumulated me at

111
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,510
the urge to pee and then go through

112
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,759
through the sphincter muscles in the

113
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,209
lease to hearing and excrete that from

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,579
the body

115
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,860
eliminating I'll also waste products

116
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,379
from the body this is in how your body

117
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,240
is able to filter the blood

118
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,490
concentrate toxins

119
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,530
them from the body to avoid an excessive

120
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,069
buildup which can threaten the life of

121
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:34,068
the individual
