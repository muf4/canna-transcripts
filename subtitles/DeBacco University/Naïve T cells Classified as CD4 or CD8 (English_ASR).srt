1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,169
okay here okay t-cells classified as

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:09,629
either cd4 or cd8 you may have seen

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,669
these images before depending on or

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,620
order your watch some of the videos I

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,849
have posted under this channel but we're

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,299
gonna explore these a little bit more

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,850
detail in this lecture series so looking

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,289
for cd4 and cd8 cells these molecules

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,660
are important because it regulates how

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,510
the t-cell will interact with and

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,539
respond to an antigen presenting cell so

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,600
that's abbreviated a PC a PC engine

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,239
presenting cell we notice in this case

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,480
in particular where cell to cell

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,280
recognition is very important to

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,218
populations of T cells have different

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,469
mechanisms for immune protection both

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,359
buying with MHC molecules via their

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,770
antigen receptors called t-cell

20
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:55,738
receptors typically abbreviated TCR s so

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,539
in this case the TCR the t-cell

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,179
receptors are the kind of the purple

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,219
molecule here our antigen presenting

24
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,019
cell or the green molecules here and

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,180
here's our antigens being presented on

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,420
this cell this is going to lead us down

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,400
either the cd4 pathway or the cd8

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,049
pathway and we'll talk about each of

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:20,280
those coming up here so first off the

30
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:23,939
cd4 pathway so these cd4 cells are bind

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,368
with a PCS antigen presenting cells via

32
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,798
their antigen and benning MHC 2

33
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:32,849
molecules and are stimulated to become

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,520
helper T cells so these cells that go

35
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:39,328
into and simulate B cells or cytotoxic T

36
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,789
cells directly or secrete set up ends to

37
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,728
inform more in various target cells

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,320
about the pathogenic threat so what does

39
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,359
this kind of block of text kind of look

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,969
like in an image well here we have our

41
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,000
cd4 catfights what we're looking at we

42
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,759
have our t-cell receptors here we have

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,640
our cd4 what this is allowing is an

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,430
activated helper T cell so when their

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,569
cd4 helper T cell binds at the image to

46
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,700
complex in antigen presenting cell the

47
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,878
antigen presenting cell and T cells now

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,750
release our cytokines in response the

49
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,840
cytokines T cell clones

50
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,550
so so in response to this we're noticing

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,219
one cell basically cloning itself going

52
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,510
into to these cloned T cells are

53
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:27,240
produced different cytokines and

54
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:29,679
activate either B cells and cd8 cells

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,740
and these can go about as being an

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,750
integral part of the immune system so

57
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,250
what is our cd4 do well there's binding

58
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,439
that's very important in the immune

59
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,169
system they're then releasing the

60
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,539
compound causing T cells to clone itself

61
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:46,988
and from there T cells are able to

62
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:49,719
differentiate into the cd8 pathway and B

63
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,300
cells we're going to investigate in this

64
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,270
selector the cd8 next up we're going to

65
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,689
follow this cell along so looking at the

66
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,870
cd8 now what that does is that engages

67
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:05,319
an antigen embedded MHC one molecules on

68
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,840
the APCs and antigen presenting cells

69
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,959
are still need to become cytotoxic T

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,770
cells these are responsible for directly

71
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,989
killing infected cells by apoptosis and

72
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,890
emitting cytokines to amplify the immune

73
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:24,730
response so here's our cd8 binding and

74
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:28,479
our cytotoxic T cell when this interacts

75
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:31,949
with the mh1 complex the epitope complex

76
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:35,319
infected cell it produces these

77
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:38,439
molecules here these molecules are very

78
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,840
important these molecules go on now and

79
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,989
our infected cell because this cell

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,229
basically has now either virus particles

81
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,759
in it or is in some way compromised its

82
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:52,030
expression is going to be slightly

83
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:55,449
different and the peripheral foreigns

84
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,909
form the pores in the membrane so we're

85
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,099
looking at breaking apart this cell by

86
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:03,459
adding these kind of pores to the cell

87
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:06,549
we're able to break the cell down licen

88
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,439
the cell so remember the cytotoxic T

89
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,780
cells are responsible for destroying

90
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,969
this affected cell we don't want this

91
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,039
Olivia to go on and spread these virus

92
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:18,160
particles throughout the entire body as

93
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,858
a result the cytotoxic T cell is

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,120
responsible for licen or destroying that

95
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,769
cell now the cd4 and cd8 cells both are

96
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,459
surface molecules and different

97
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:31,568
different

98
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:33,909
whether teacr will engage in MHC - all

99
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,949
right seeing one molecule so here's our

100
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,250
one and here's our two as you may

101
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,620
suspect the two molecule has two here

102
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,529
embedded in the image class one only has

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,470
one bonded here because they assist in

104
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:49,469
bindings with specificity the cd4 and

105
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,900
cd8 molecules are described as

106
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,750
co-receptors so very important in our

107
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,549
binding that occurs these are an

108
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,620
integral part of the binding and

109
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,620
recognition process of the immune system
