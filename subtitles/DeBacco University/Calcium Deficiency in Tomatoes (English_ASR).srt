1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,720
okay here we're gonna be looking at

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,240
calcium deficiency in tomatoes

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,400
now our tomatoes we always want to look

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,759
this nice consistent red color or in

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,559
some cases there might be some yellow

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,039
varieties

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,759
we're seeing that color consistent from

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,320
the very

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,320
edge or margin all the way through

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
however in calcium deficiency

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,839
you can see even at the immature stage

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,920
there'll be this browning

13
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,599
that occurs typically towards the

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,118
blossom end

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,039
so let's first look at calcium's

16
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,640
importance well first off it's an

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
immobile nutrient that means it doesn't

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,439
really

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,600
travel very well through the plant

20
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,199
meaning deficiencies tend to show up in

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
areas where it needs to travel the

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
furthest point

23
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,839
being right here if we look at the image

24
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,919
of the tomato

25
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,239
where the blossom end is the all the

26
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
nutrients have to come from the stem

27
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,679
down through the early part of the

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,920
tomato

29
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,719
the area that is the closest to the main

30
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
stock and then that calcium travels down

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,960
because it's immobile doesn't travel

32
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,038
very far so in the case of deficiencies

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,558
the plant is more likely to show these

34
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,239
deficiency symptoms

35
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,840
more towards the end of the blossoming

36
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
because that's the furthest distance

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,359
that calcium would have to travel well

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
to prevent blossom and rot

39
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,640
in the most economical it's very

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
damaging

41
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,359
to growers you can lose entire crop

42
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,478
despite growing the entire plants

43
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,400
so it's why it's of economic importance

44
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,759
calcium help forms compounds and cell

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,840
walls that's what helps kind of

46
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,599
keep their integrity that's why areas

47
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,478
here that have poor calcium will be kind

48
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,319
of soft as well as discolored

49
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,478
calcium also stimulates root and leaf

50
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,959
development and influences the uptake of

51
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,840
other

52
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,599
nutrients so more than just calcium it

53
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
also influences other things

54
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,839
it can also be involved with cell

55
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,519
signaling now there's a tomato trial

56
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,200
here it was done in a greenhouse in

57
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,200
the hydroponic setup here to help

58
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
maintain consistent conditions

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,439
and the hydroponics allowed only very

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
specific nutrients to be added

61
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,798
compared to if it was a soil based

62
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
system you're going to see a control

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
plant that was held

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
fed a balanced fertilizer what a normal

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,200
plant should look like and then the test

66
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
plant and that was fed

67
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,520
all the nutrients except the one being

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
studied to allow for the isolated

69
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,280
deficiency

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,440
symptoms to show up so this is a

71
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
perfect example what calcium deficiency

72
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,759
actually looks like in a tomato plant

73
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
this is even before and this is a severe

74
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,079
case before we even get to the actual

75
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,919
fruit

76
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
notice the browning of the new leaves

77
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,479
you can see this newer growth has that

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
browning

79
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,639
that is occurring there tends to be more

80
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,759
damage to the upper or newer portions of

81
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,679
the plant so that's

82
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,439
one characteristic of a calcium

83
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
deficiency in plants

84
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,000
keep in mind though this plant has no

85
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,080
fruit yield in it so the odds

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,039
are not well of having a marketable

87
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
fruit or

88
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,318
mature on this plant when you're seeing

89
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
it in the plant even before you get

90
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,280
flowers

91
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,479
so again showing an extreme case you

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,919
could see it definitely on the fruit in

93
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,479
the other image but here is what it

94
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,318
looks like

95
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,919
in the actual plant the comparison again

96
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,919
here's that same

97
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,439
plant there we had minus that calcium

98
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,958
treatment and we have the control that's

99
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,719
what a plant should look like

100
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,158
this should be upright but it grew so

101
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,080
aggressively because it kind of fell

102
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,199
over we're seeing the consistent green

103
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
color

104
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,238
some areas though in the test plant do

105
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
have normal that green

106
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,719
leaf color but the most recent growth

107
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,439
that newer growth tends to get that

108
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,719
browning

109
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,199
that occurs so how do we correct this

110
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,959
problem

111
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,560
well calcium should be fed to the plants

112
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,239
repeatedly since it does take time to

113
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,039
build up in the plants

114
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,400
especially if the deficiency does exist

115
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,318
here's two products here one's called

116
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,120
biomine calcium one called cal

117
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,639
magmax biomin start usually an ounce per

118
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
gallon that can be applied to the leaves

119
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,439
and

120
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,878
a drench as well it's omri certified

121
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,479
i'll use caution when tank mixing

122
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,158
because it may not get along with

123
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,598
other nutrients they're typically

124
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,840
applied alone

125
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,439
calmagnax follow the same basic dilution

126
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,598
rate it's not armory certified

127
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,598
but it does improve calcium and

128
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,839
magnesium levels in the plant

129
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,318
and as always with most calcium products

130
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,200
use caution when tank mixing so not to

131
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,238
have any potential interactions that be

132
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,560
unwanted

133
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
feeding these to a tomato plant

134
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,120
consistently

135
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
or on a repeated schedule will help

136
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,400
reduce the chance that you ever see

137
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,399
a calcium deficiency
