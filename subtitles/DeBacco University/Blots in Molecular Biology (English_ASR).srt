1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
sometimes in a molecular biology lab

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,798
you'll hear people that you think

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,399
are lost and using a compass to try to

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,400
find their direction

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,839
this is a blotting compass because a lot

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
of the blots get their

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,279
names from cardinal directions so these

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,320
are blots

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,879
in molecular biology well starting first

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
with a

11
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,278
southern blot a southern blot is a

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,278
sensitive method for detection of a dna

13
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,879
sequence within a mixture the dna is

14
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,480
first cleaved or cut with restriction

15
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,000
enzymes to produce fragments

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
that can be separated by gel

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,558
electrophoresis after electrophoresis

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
dna fragments are transferred to a

19
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,280
nitrocellulose membrane by capillary

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,600
action

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
creating a replica of the original gel

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,359
the membrane is incubated with

23
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,519
a labeled probe which binds to and

24
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,399
detects fragments of interest

25
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,160
so we have our dna we have our gel run

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,840
it through we have this transfer step

27
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,198
we have this blotting step and

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
ultimately what we're left with is what

29
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,039
looks like

30
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,519
lines in a column specifically this is

31
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,920
looking

32
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,000
at dna and this is why it is the

33
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,679
southern blotting technique

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,759
in contrast we have the northern

35
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,760
blotting technique

36
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,519
and this is a method for detection of

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,280
specific mrna

38
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,599
in a mixture of rnas looking at

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560
specifically messenger rna

40
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,319
and while it looks very similar to the

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,879
southern blot we just saw some lines in

42
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,079
a column

43
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
this is looking at something very

44
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,840
different however like southern blotting

45
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:22,719
this method is highly specific and

46
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,040
sensitive

47
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,719
rna from cells and tissues is extracted

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
and separated by electrophoresis

49
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,478
as in southern blotting rna is

50
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,600
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane

51
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,078
and incubated with a labeled probe

52
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,438
that is complementary to the rna this

53
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,639
method can be used to

54
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,879
quantitate the transcription of rna

55
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
under different cellular conditions so

56
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,118
this is kind of a way to get the sense

57
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,359
of the amount

58
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,560
and you can see kind of the end result

59
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,118
located here for

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
northern blotting looking at mrna then

61
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,438
there's also

62
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
western blotting which again has a very

63
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,279
similar image if you just look at it

64
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,520
but western blotting is a laboratory

65
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,799
method used to detect specific protein

66
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,640
molecules among a mixture of proteins

67
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,000
this mixture can include all of the

68
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
proteins associated with a particular

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,318
tissue or cell type

70
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,239
western blots can also be used to

71
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,958
evaluate the size of the protein of

72
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,878
interest

73
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,959
and used to measure the the amount of

74
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,199
protein expression that's occurring

75
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,959
this procedure was named similarity to

76
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,439
its previously invented method known as

77
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,959
the

78
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,878
southern blot and that's why it gets the

79
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,520
term the western plot looking at

80
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,679
specific

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,959
protein molecules now these three

82
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,319
molecules you can kind of like

83
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
these three blind techniques looking at

84
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,878
three different molecules can kind of be

85
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
compared here

86
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,799
you kind of get the idea of the southern

87
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
blotting in the first column the middle

88
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
column being northern

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,199
and the last column here being western

90
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,559
black and you can see how there's some

91
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,958
similarities between them

92
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840
but also some differences the key part

93
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
looking at

94
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,080
different identifying markers are

95
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
molecules in this case

96
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
dna looking at rna and looking at

97
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
proteins

98
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
now i'm just going to mention here at

99
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,079
the very end some other blots

100
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
because those are the major ones but

101
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
there is if you're wondering there is an

102
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
eastern blot a far

103
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,039
western blot at southwestern reverse

104
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
northern blah and a dot blot

105
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,039
as well so all these looking at very

106
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,159
specific things

107
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,158
all different blocks southern northern

108
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,318
and western are by far the most common

109
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,598
eastern bodies used for detection of

110
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,000
post transit train

111
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,119
transitional modifications of proteins

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,039
far western is used

113
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,039
uses antibodies to detect the presence

114
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,000
of protein protein complexes

115
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,120
uh this southwestern blot is based off

116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,639
the southern blot that's where it kind

117
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,799
of gets part of its name from

118
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,079
used to identify characterizing dna

119
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,920
binding proteins

120
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,519
reverse northern blot that differs from

121
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,199
both northern and southern blot and that

122
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,400
the dna is first immobilized in a

123
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,079
blotting matrix

124
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
then specific sequences are detected

125
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
with labeled rna probes

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,598
so you can see we get into some little

127
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,039
bit uh different protocols as far as the

128
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,919
procedures to carry out

129
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,560
and lastly the dot blot is a special

130
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,479
case

131
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,759
of any of the above blocks where it does

132
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,399
um now

133
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,598
analyte these added directly to the

134
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,360
blotting matrix

135
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,238
it appears as dots as opposed to

136
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,319
separating the sample with

137
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,799
electrophoresis prior to blotting

138
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,079
so that's one is a little bit different

139
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,560
the rest definitely

140
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
depend heavily on electrophoresis and

141
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
separating things out in a gel

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
before transferring them to another

143
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,759
membrane so again this is just kind of

144
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,358
that basic overview of all the different

145
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,000
types of blots that may

146
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,519
occur uh and hopefully this makes a

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
little bit more sense and you're not

148
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,120
completely lost

149
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,759
in the kernel directions of molecular

150
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
biology
