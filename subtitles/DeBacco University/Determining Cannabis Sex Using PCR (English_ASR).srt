1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
so welcome to this debaco university

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,798
video

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,080
we're looking at determining cannabis

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,920
sex using pcr using the pcr method

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,320
which is advantageous because you can

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,359
tell whether a plant is male or female

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,480
well before it actually flowers here so

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,919
we'll go over some

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,519
of the methods and some of the

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:30,640
background of this plymouth

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:32,799
chain reaction method or pcr

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
all right let's get into the video here

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,039
so first off we're looking at male

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,000
and female flowers so canvas is mostly

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,920
deices

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,159
what does that mean well for fiber hemp

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,440
varieties have been bred to be monishes

18
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,279
and when we use these terms what does

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,159
that mean well diocese means that it's

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,039
producing either

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,599
a female plant or it's producing a male

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,198
plant

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,198
miniatures will produce male and female

24
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,960
flowers on the same plant

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,878
so with this diocese we're having these

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,558
distinct female and male plants

27
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,479
separating out those plants as male and

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,280
females at early development stage is

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,599
useful

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
due to the influence of gender at

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,719
agriculturally significant

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,159
traits meaning if we're looking at

33
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,679
producing cannabinoids we definitely

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
want to be selecting for those

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
female plants and discarding those males

36
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,839
so we're eliminating

37
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,118
the presence of pollination limit the

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,799
presence of that pollen

39
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,879
to reduce the chance that seeds are

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,600
formed which would greatly reduce the

41
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,438
total cannabinoids produced

42
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,959
now with when we're looking at this pcr

43
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,559
method what's going to be utilized is

44
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,319
going to be dna markers

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
cell experiments have been done to focus

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,199
on developing reliable molecular marker

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
for sex determination in cannabis plants

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
dna markers for the detection of male

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
genotypes is utilized

50
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,078
and we talked about dna markers you

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
might be familiar with running things on

52
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,158
a gel with

53
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,000
electrophoresis here we also have

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
the utils utilization of these different

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,599
primers that will bind to specific

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
sequences if they're present

57
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,599
and replicate them so that we can

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
determine whether that small snippet of

59
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,718
a leaf

60
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,718
is a from a male plant or from a female

61
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,199
plant because those plants contain

62
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,718
all those genetic markers at the very

63
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
early age

64
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,919
so those male genes specifically the

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
exact markers used can be debated but in

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,199
general concept

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
is the same for all if the markers for

68
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,159
the male gene or genes are found in the

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
plant

70
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,840
will not produce the high cannabinoid

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,479
salt flowers that many growers are

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
growing

73
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,840
for meaning if we determine it to be a

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
male plant a lot of pollen is going to

75
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,759
produce but not a lot of cannabinoids

76
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,598
now why i've produced here kind of a

77
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,878
horse example looking at determining

78
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,039
males or females

79
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,639
keep in mind the mare mare is considered

80
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,959
to be an adult female horse

81
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,479
and a occult is a young male horse so

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
here we can see the genetic markers we

83
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,799
could see

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,120
our samples we could kind of make a

85
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
correlation of what matches with what

86
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,759
here

87
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,800
again may not always be a perfect match

88
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,120
but we could clearly see

89
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
s1 sample one here certainly looks like

90
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,560
one of the occult or a young

91
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,878
male horse and the same is basically

92
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,719
applied to cannabis

93
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,919
now why would you use pcr what's the

94
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,519
advantage here

95
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,518
well research implements chain reaction

96
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
that's pcr it shows

97
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,039
could continue in order to find more

98
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,119
advanced dna markers for sex

99
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,359
determination within cannabis plants

100
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
this allows not only for quick detection

101
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
time but also

102
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,598
very accurate results both things

103
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,439
growers are looking for

104
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,199
the plant sample required is very

105
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,919
minimal so it can be formed on plants

106
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,000
early on in the sealing stage to reduce

107
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,439
wasted care space and time on plants

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,158
that will not produce desirable end

109
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,598
products

110
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,158
the reason why i can work on plants that

111
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,158
are so small is it's using the genetic

112
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,399
level and it's able to screen for only

113
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,000
it really only needs one piece of dna

114
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
pcr would go through this multiple

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,719
thermocycler this cycle run

116
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,719
to amplify and it amplifies things on an

117
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,318
exponential form so technically having

118
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,639
only one sequence of dna

119
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,958
it would amplify that to be a very large

120
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,359
number to show up on a electrophoresis

121
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,640
gel

122
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,400
to be able to use for detection now can

123
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,919
the cost be justified so this is one of

124
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
those constant questions when we're

125
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,238
looking particularly

126
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,840
at pcr can we justify the cost of pcr

127
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,519
so while this can be expensive for some

128
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,598
growers they some can

129
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
justify the cost for larger grow

130
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,039
operations we'll often set

131
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
this up in-house meaning they can

132
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,199
conduct these pcr treatments

133
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
within their own grow facility as after

134
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,318
the initial cost the reoccurring costs

135
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,280
are actually quite minimal once you

136
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,519
purchase everything

137
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
reoccurring costs are quite minimal for

138
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
medium and small operations infill

139
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,879
samples typically will be sent

140
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
out for testing for a fee from a testing

141
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,279
lab

142
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
and the great question is in cost to

143
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,879
benefit analysis

144
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
is the cost of the tests going to be

145
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,918
less than what it would take to grow

146
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,000
that plant to

147
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,399
produce flowers to be able to identify

148
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
it and that is really up to the grower

149
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,120
to

150
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
to look at for their operation for their

151
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
particular um

152
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,519
kind of cost their particular potential

153
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,520
benefits

154
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:49,120
to make that decision that's the best

155
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,120
for their operation
