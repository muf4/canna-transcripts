1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,700
here we're going to look at transport

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,620
through cell membranes we've saw a

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,809
little bit about the cell membrane in a

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,820
previous video now we're looking at

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,820
learning a little bit more about the

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,710
actual transport process that occurs in

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,260
order for things to pass through here

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,050
remember some time is semi permeable I

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,840
mean it only allows certain things to

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,490
come through so starting with the basics

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,800
here this is a great description image

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,320
here we have our cell and we're focusing

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,579
on this area right here well in a zoomed

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,450
in version of that would be right here

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,359
their cell memory

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,100
there were carbohydrates or

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,738
glycoproteins we have our protein

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,329
channels or cholesterol glycol lipids we

19
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,399
zoom in even closer but look just at

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,929
this area in the green box well that's

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,750
our phospholipid bilayer

22
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,750
that's our bilayer of our phosphates and

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,280
our lipids and we look at one specific

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,378
of those called the head in the tail

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,808
region that'd be our phospholipid our

26
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,570
hydrophilic head moving liking water and

27
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:03,000
hydrophobic tail so how does all this

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,489
come together well this helps regulate

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,969
the passage of substances into it out of

30
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,340
the cells between cell organelles and

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,099
the cytosol remember organelles we had a

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,670
whole lecture series on that the cytosol

33
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,099
in this case of this gray area here it's

34
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,109
important to detect chemical messengers

35
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,459
arriving at the surface this is

36
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,200
important for cells to be able to

37
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,688
recognize certain hormones or other

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,900
substances they also linked adjacent

39
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,849
cells together by membrane junctions in

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,950
Anker cells to the extracellular matrix

41
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,750
so you can see there's a lot going on

42
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,880
here so functions of our cell membrane

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,509
more than just kind of creating a

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,978
protective layer on the outside one

45
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,349
important function here is transport and

46
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,078
as they send many forms on the left of

47
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,459
my image over here a protein spans the

48
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,228
membrane again going from the

49
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,929
extracellular space to the intracellular

50
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,368
space this may provide a hydrophilic

51
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,280
channel across the membrane that's

52
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:01,500
selected for a particular solute so in

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,269
this case it's so allowing the small

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,849
little green molecules to come through

55
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,008
on the right hand side here other

56
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,258
transport proteins shuttle substances

57
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,389
from one side to the other by changing

58
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,799
shape you can see here it's opened on

59
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,569
the top

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,310
it's close and top and bottom ends open

61
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,129
only on the bottom some of these

62
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,810
proteins hydrolyze or release ATP as an

63
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,539
energy source to actively pump

64
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,640
substances across the membrane so

65
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:30,150
certain one certain protein channels

66
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:32,279
just passively allow it to happen others

67
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,129
require ATP or this energy investment

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,069
for transporting molecules here it looks

69
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:40,560
like the larger lighter green kind of

70
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,810
oval-shaped ones require a different

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,409
protein to be moved across this membrane

72
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,479
than the small green ones so there's

73
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:52,530
three categories we can kind of rank to

74
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:56,879
transport in it can be diffusion carrier

75
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:59,340
mediated or vesicle transport now within

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,979
these we can subdivide them into active

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,450
in passive so to transport the cell

78
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,199
membrane it can be active this requires

79
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:09,479
energy in ATP like active learning right

80
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,329
what we do in class requires you know

81
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,189
energy and you're prodded use ATP not

82
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,320
this is still your favorite thing to do

83
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:18,569
but it's an active transport still

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,519
important there's passive which we all

85
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,289
wish is how we could learn through no

86
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,450
energy requirement you just kind of sit

87
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:27,120
there and hope that you just kind of

88
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,369
learn all the information but inquiring

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,420
no energy investment on your point sadly

90
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,849
I'll tell you right now in this class

91
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,219
and I'll already tends to be more of the

92
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,629
active transport within these three

93
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,180
categories we have diffusion which is

94
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,709
simply passive just things diffuse from

95
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,739
higher concentration to lower

96
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,340
concentration carrier meet mediated

97
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,719
transport this can be passive or active

98
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,610
so just because something requires a

99
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,379
protein and move it across the barrier

100
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,130
doesn't always mean it's active

101
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,590
transport

102
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,969
sometimes it just needs that protein act

103
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,099
as a channel to be able to move its way

104
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:04,430
through other times it will require our

105
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:07,109
ATP and then our transport through the

106
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,780
vesicles this will always require energy

107
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,519
the formation of the vesicles and be

108
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,759
able to pull things through that is

109
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,798
going to require energy so looking here

110
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,418
a nice example passive and active member

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,548
extracellular fluid or bring things into

112
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,769
the cell passive transport is diffusion

113
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,409
of a substance across a membrane with no

114
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,180
energy investment no energy investments

115
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,460
the key point here doesn't

116
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,379
that mean no proteins or other channels

117
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,508
are needed there's three main types

118
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,310
there's simple diffusion facilitated

119
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:38,038
diffusion this is the one that does

120
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,959
require proteins or as Moses which is

121
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,699
the movement of water so here's our

122
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,379
paths that we have oxygen just diffusing

123
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,000
right through the membrane an area of

124
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,329
higher concentration or area of lower

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,089
concentration sodium ions require a

126
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,550
channel however it's still passive this

127
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,829
is what we call facilitated diffusion

128
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,410
this is where it is simply diffusing

129
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,810
across but does require this protein

130
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,060
this protein isn't requiring any energy

131
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,610
to have it occur but the protein is

132
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,959
necessary and then there's active here

133
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,439
but we're having a pump core actually

134
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,810
using ATP can write to ADP to move in

135
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,660
this case sodium ions out and potassium

136
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,189
ions into the cell so keep in mind that

137
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,590
facilitated diffusion remember still

138
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:23,719
diffusion no energy required active

139
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,719
transport is actively using ATP
