1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,929
okay here I'm gonna go over dihybrid

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,330
crosses so if you've seen the punnett

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,980
square of basics this builds on that and

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,740
could see those were just monohybrid

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,920
crosses this is dihybrid we see our

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,388
punnett square getting ever larger here

7
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,460
so first off a dihybrid cross involves

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,528
two traits in a four by four punnett

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,240
square the example is a pea plant that

10
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:23,670
is heterozygous for round yellow seeds

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,259
itself fertilized what are the

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,460
phenotypic ratios of the resulting

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,449
offspring as we see here

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,820
so heterozygous round and yellow seeds

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,590
so heterozygous for yellow also what

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,840
happens if we cross two of these

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,270
individuals together we know how we got

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,579
that trait by in this case showing this

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,030
potential outcome for the cross working

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,460
out this f1 generation and what we need

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,500
to first do is determine the parental

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,448
genotypes and then the offspring where

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,770
the gamete of these can produce to

24
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:54,349
derive the gametes we're gonna use the

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,059
foil method and that's from math class

26
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,939
first outer inner last see this

27
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:03,119
distribution that occurs so as a result

28
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,399
from this heterozygous and heterozygous

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,469
traits crossed together two individuals

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,350
two parents both heterozygous for these

31
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:13,500
traits notice that parent one has big R

32
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:16,649
we go through and we cross it with Big Y

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,170
so to our big R and her big why the big

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,710
R also gets distributed though to our

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,810
little Y so big R little Y the first

36
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,640
parent then we need to also recognize

37
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,159
the other allele in this case the

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,790
recessive the little R little R goes to

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,310
Big Y and then little R goes to little Y

40
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,590
this is parent one now because they're

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,530
both the same the parent to us the same

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,100
potential gametes of her offspring so

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:48,118
big R goes to Big Y big art a little Y

44
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,859
little R to Big Y little art a little Y

45
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,269
these are our genotypes that we're going

46
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,500
to use in our 4x4 punnett square so in

47
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:57,959
this case this has a little slightly

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,250
different example but we did find that

49
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,929
would be the gametes for those

50
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,250
individuals now we're looking at

51
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,430
slightly different trying to make this

52
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,078
example a little bit easier we have our

53
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,679
gametes here and argument from this

54
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,120
parent was all homozygous recessive so

55
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,860
it makes it a little bit easier when we

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,230
go through and figure out this example

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,850
punnett square and just as we saw in

58
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,729
punnett square basics we did the same

59
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,349
cross the same drag down so big R would

60
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,419
be here here here and here

61
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,289
but we remember big art with little R

62
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:30,719
big R little R so on and so forth how

63
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:34,259
this is gonna end up looking is like

64
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,389
this now a lot of students I find put

65
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,979
the R and then do the R on the Y and

66
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,889
they are on the Y that's not how you

67
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,349
want to represent you want to put like

68
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,569
alleles together so in this case our big

69
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,299
R and our little R or put together our

70
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,560
big Y and our little Y are put together

71
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,040
go back and look that would stand for

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,189
around in yells be the phenotype because

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,409
round is dominant yellow is dominant and

74
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,479
we notice that carry through throughout

75
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,430
the same here you can remember this

76
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,179
individual different in the initial

77
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,800
example here is homozygous recessive but

78
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,230
you notice all the RS are kept together

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,880
and all the Y's are kept together the

80
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:14,129
reason we use that for organization is

81
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,539
when I ask for phenotypes or asked to

82
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,629
give the phenotype it makes it much

83
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,679
easier to follow and understand so

84
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,079
providing this with a little bit of a

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,030
picture here the cross this is the

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,310
homozygous recessive individual opposes

87
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,140
rough and green crossed in this case

88
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,239
with almost I guess dominant smooth in

89
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,738
yellow the results in all plants will

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,500
produce this heterozygote here and we

91
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,909
see that example here now looking at

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,250
taking these individuals and crossing

93
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,650
them together in the f2 generation and

94
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,169
here is our heterozygous and

95
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,200
heterozygous crossing those together

96
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,639
this are resulting offspring the cross

97
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,219
between two individuals from the f1

98
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,500
generation increases variation due to

99
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,669
the heterozygote and we can notice here

100
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,580
basically forms a 9 2 3 2 3 2 1 ratio

101
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:01,979
and we see that represented right here

102
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,799
again remember that yellow is dominant

103
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,259
so it's smooth rough in green would be

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,540
the recessive you see one individual

105
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,689
here from these two heterozygotes would

106
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,250
be that rough in that green color so I

107
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,350
know this is a little bit difficult to

108
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,759
follow maybe initially but if you go

109
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,879
back over and look at some of these

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,769
examples and follow where these gametes

111
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,529
come from either it'll be easier to

112
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,659
understand this is putting it all

113
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:29,939
together in a dihybrid cross

114
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,800
we have the initial generation the f1

115
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,779
and we take to these individuals who

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,620
went across and then together and that's

117
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,149
where it gets a little bit more

118
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,370
confusing and that's where we get to

119
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:41,459
this 4x4 remember the gametes are

120
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,220
distributed big R with big Y big R with

121
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,599
little Y little R with Big Y little R

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,850
with little Y in the same hand we just

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,920
simply drag and cross them together keep

124
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,340
like alleles together and a be a whole

125
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,560
lot easier trying here with some video

126
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,439
links if you want some to hear from a

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,449
couple other people some other ideas
