1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,169
now this can be a common problem with

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,940
many growers and that's the simple over

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:07,890
fertilizing of the crop

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,839
just pouring on the fertilizer more and

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,120
more thing that's gonna do benefit when

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,638
actually it actually will result in

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,339
potentially more harm or negatively

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,480
impacting the end product so this is a

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,679
common occurrence with growers because

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,260
they want to make sure they get the most

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,670
out of their plants so they figured a

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,380
little more fertilizer it's not gonna

13
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,840
cost me that much more but I want to

14
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,579
ensure I get the best yield that I can

15
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,829
however it's important for these growers

16
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,808
to remember that over fertilizing can

17
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,030
not only hurt yields potentially get

18
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,709
into toxicity range but can waste money

19
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,000
and potentially contaminate groundwater

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,128
I want to keep an idea of sustainability

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,988
on a keep our rivers and waterways as

22
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,909
clean as possible without contaminating

23
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,308
them I also don't want to waste money on

24
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,288
it necessarily so these are both ways

25
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,359
that we're fertilizing can negatively

26
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,050
affect the grower and also the

27
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,269
environment signs of over fertilization

28
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,280
could be brittle leaves burn leave

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,618
margins and bloods that smell like

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,079
fertilizer does it make noise when

31
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,760
they're burned they're just ways to be

32
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,890
able to tell if you've over fertilized a

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,780
crop sadly many of these kind of wait

34
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,310
until the end result so it's important

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,079
to be mindful of that throughout the

36
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,700
process to be testing leaves to make

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,219
sure they do have some flexibility to

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,740
them and watching the margins for

39
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,209
potential over fertilization burn also

40
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,769
want to be careful with other things

41
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,959
that can cause a leaf margins to burn

42
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,899
such as being too close to the lights or

43
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,780
deficiencies even in some instances so

44
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,210
again just follow recommendations err on

45
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,239
the side of caution you can always add

46
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,679
more fertilizer and it's harder than it

47
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,658
is to take it away

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,700
once you've over added it so be mindful

49
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,009
so that you're growing their crop in a

50
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,299
sustainable manner not wasting money and

51
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,780
that potentially contaminating the

52
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,780
environment
