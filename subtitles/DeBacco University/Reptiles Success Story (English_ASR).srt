1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,349
here I'm going to tell you a little bit

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:06,689
about reptiles success story and how

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:10,050
they've become so well adapted to the

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,660
terrestrial or land environment see some

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,000
sea turtles here recently hatched making

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,559
a run for the water here hopefully not

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,320
get picked up by any predators or

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,969
seagulls on their way there so let's

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,100
start with the history of reptiles the

10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,858
origin and evolution well first off they

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,130
arose from in phidian's so the earliest

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,019
fossils is about 359 million years ago

13
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:32,640
small four-legged vertebrates with small

14
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,379
teeth now it's important to make the

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,649
distinction between a reptile and

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,440
amphibian so reptiles are cold-blooded

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,109
have a backbone scaly skin and lay eggs

18
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,280
in contrast to that amphibians pictured

19
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,589
here are cold blooded

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,989
it's a similarity they also have a

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,420
backbone but they have moist skin they

22
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,238
lay eggs near water and they go through

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,739
a metamorphosis during their life cycle

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,198
just remember we're gonna be focused

25
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:02,669
more on the reptiles here don't get them

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,649
confused with the Indians so success of

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,810
reptiles well there's four important

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,030
steps we're gonna focus on two in

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,700
particular one is the watertight skin

30
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,040
that keratin you know let's give them

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,560
their watertight abilities respiration

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,390
they develop lungs excretion actually is

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,129
uric acid which requires very little

34
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,079
water so they can conserve water so

35
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,349
they're not wasting a lot of that in the

36
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,429
in the Attic egg a little quote here

37
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,259
it's not the strongest of the species

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,140
that survives nor the most intelligent

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,640
but the one most adaptable to change if

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,799
that mind you look here at reptiles

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,170
so water retention wellin tipene's

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,970
sample frogs cannot be considered fully

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,129
terrestrial because they lose too much

44
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,349
water through their skin in Phoebe's

45
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,239
must stay moist to avoid dehydration and

46
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,250
their method of reproduction requires a

47
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,709
moist environment see that here it's

48
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,269
little toad swimming in the water

49
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:56,099
reptiles so have evolutionary

50
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,438
adaptations that free them from the

51
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,239
water be able to live much more on land

52
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,339
now of course they still require water

53
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,859
but they don't have to be living in

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,189
water they can hit all much harsher and

55
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,689
more arid environment so that water

56
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,340
tight skin terrestrial animals face

57
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,340
serious problems of water loss as water

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,959
evaporates through their skin my

59
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,450
reptiles have evolved the skin made of

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,000
light flexible scales that overlap

61
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:22,488
deform protective almost watertight skin

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,900
that minimizes water loss let me see

63
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,180
that here and if ever touched a snake

64
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,650
you might expect them to be slimy but

65
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,080
it's actually just this interlocking

66
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,599
kind of scales there and the main goal

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,069
is to reduce water loss here we're

68
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:36,139
adding the advantage of camouflage in

69
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:38,628
both these cases but really those

70
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:42,068
interlocking watertight skin allows them

71
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:44,389
to survive in these much drier regions

72
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:46,159
watertight eggs also without a watery

73
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:48,500
environment most firm and eggs will try

74
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,789
out a reptiles fertilized eggs need a

75
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,639
moist environment in which to develop

76
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:54,169
the amniotic egg cells is from a reptile

77
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,750
needing a moist environment to develop

78
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,669
so that harsh outer shell we have that

79
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,709
nice kind of watery environment on the

80
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:05,119
inside allowing for the embryo to

81
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,860
develop inside a dry sand here but in

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
its small micro environment inside the

83
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,750
egg it has the water that it needs to be

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,650
able to survive through its early stages

85
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,299
of development watertight eggs in ma

86
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,969
Iook Iike names both water supply and

87
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,819
food supply there's a key to a reptiles

88
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:24,500
success as a terrestrial animal the eggs

89
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:27,619
tough shell mix essentially watertight

90
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,469
does not dry out even in very dry

91
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,030
habitats most reptiles all birds and

92
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,709
three species of mammals actually

93
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,900
reproduced by the in the Attic eggs with

94
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,459
shells and the formation of amniotic egg

95
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,799
suggests that these three groups of

96
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,900
animals evolved from a common ancestor

97
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,030
now we say Emily attic eggs we might

98
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,799
think of the ones we buy in the store

99
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,719
but realize that there's many different

100
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,489
types some people may have been

101
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,189
fortunate enough to see like Robins eggs

102
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,780
right sometimes their nest or locating

103
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:56,180
areas in your houses or developments

104
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,639
that's another example of the amniotic

105
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,919
watertight egg but they come in all sort

106
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,500
of shapes colors and ways to camouflage

107
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,219
in those ways to stand out it's unique

108
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,348
based on individual species now the

109
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,289
amniotic egg reptiles considered the

110
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:14,358
first rest really depressed the amniotic

111
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:16,370
egg first evolved in reptiles but also

112
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,859
found as I said animals birds

113
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,509
I'm sorry mammals and birds protection

114
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,699
from the physical damage see hard outer

115
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:25,519
shell this limits the evaporation of

116
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,589
water but still able to diffuse oxygen

117
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,209
and carbon dioxide this

118
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:31,129
here on our profession or cladograms the

119
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:33,379
development of the amniotic egg being

120
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:36,019
fairly far along in the development

121
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:38,659
process here so relatively advanced

122
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:41,379
animals continuing with this we have the

123
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,490
internal structure of the amniotic egg

124
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,810
amnion which is the thin membrane that

125
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,990
encloses the fluid where the embryo

126
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,939
floats kate here by this kind of purply

127
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,519
grayish region the yolk sac which

128
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,879
encloses the yolk fat rich food supply

129
00:04:52,519 --> 00:05:00,049
fitting in maryland's with the yolk is

130
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:01,699
we have the left two lists elect miss

131
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,460
which stores water produced by the

132
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:06,228
embryo and we have the chorion which

133
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:08,629
surrounds all other membranes we see

134
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:10,279
that located here's the chorion albumin

135
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:13,668
is the protein and water for the embryo

136
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:16,000
this is the albumin okay right here this

137
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:17,990
is in part which which makes eggs very

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,819
nutritious and why a lot of people eat

139
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,069
them is because they do contain a lot of

140
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,050
this protein and a lot of these good

141
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:28,370
supplies assuming they weren't

142
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,660
fertilized so the em yak egg the amnion

143
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,579
encloses the embryo with the watery

144
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,380
environment creating like a little ponds

145
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,779
is a way to think about it that watery

146
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:39,199
region within this hard protective shell

147
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,519
and this shell also protects the aching

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,740
being crushed up and in what environment

149
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,629
and maybe in animals may be sitting on

150
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,590
this it might be buried in sand burning

151
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:50,598
the nest that's offering protection

152
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:53,509
what's interesting about the egg is the

153
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:56,478
yolk sac and NZO which is the developing

154
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:58,339
food supply for that Union bail this

155
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:04,370
extras waste products from the arrest so

156
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:06,049
the left to us stores the waste products

157
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,360
because remember in a sealed environment

158
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,579
here so we just can't have a way just to

159
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,360
produce you know nutrients we also need

160
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:17,089
an area to put the waste products also

161
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,020
allowing gas exchange so while this is a

162
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,509
hard protective shell

163
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:23,000
there's also carbon dioxide able to

164
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:25,879
diffuse out and oxygen is able to

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,978
diffuse in and there is an airspace a

166
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:32,240
little bit there along the similar to be

167
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:34,550
able to basically breathe within a quote

168
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
sealed environment blood vessels and no

169
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,780
walls carry oxygen carbon oxide from the

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,060
embryo so Mars is a living developing

171
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:44,259
individual

172
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:48,560
the knack eggs surrounded by the element

173
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:52,039
yolk sac and a lot to us is the membrane

174
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,899
called the chorion the chorion allows

175
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,000
oxygen to enter the egg and carbon

176
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:58,279
dioxide to leave so that's a very

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,470
important portion to allow that

178
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,899
individual to be able to grow and

179
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,820
develop you ever seen a bird beak

180
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:07,039
breakthrough that's been really able to

181
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,689
breathe air and they didn't just kind of

182
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,189
get suffocated in that egg they're

183
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,610
allowed to exchange that carbon dioxide

184
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:16,069
and oxygen that last kind of picture

185
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,080
here and then find some of the key parts

186
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,240
where certain things are located a

187
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,279
little different image here just be able

188
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,379
to kind of identify the main parts and

189
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,959
also what their functions are for the

190
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:29,089
importance of the amniotic egg which led

191
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,919
to the success of reptiles being able to

192
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,739
make that jump from the watery

193
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,890
environment to the arid dry land in

194
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,889
there
