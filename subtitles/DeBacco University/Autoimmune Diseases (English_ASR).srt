1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,688
okay I'm going to go over autoimmune

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,838
diseases here I'm going to give you a

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,550
brief definition as well as point out

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,440
some diseases that you may have heard of

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,048
but did not know that they were an

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,298
autoimmune disease so first off the

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,759
definition of an autoimmune disease what

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,129
happens during this is cytotoxic T cells

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,730
and B cells lose their ability to

10
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:26,820
distinguish self cells from non-self

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,469
cells as a result from this the body

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,109
actually starts attacking its own

13
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,119
tissues so as a reminder in a normal

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,969
immune response we had antigens that

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,949
invade our body build up antibodies to

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,770
form against them when the antibodies

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,629
remove the invading antigens as a result

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,239
the advisors remain and protect

19
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,878
ourselves for the long term that's a

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,619
normal case however in an autoimmune

21
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,530
disease our immune system forms

22
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,689
antibodies to self antigens the

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,370
antibodies attack self antigens and as a

24
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,799
result the body has a high degree of

25
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,439
inflammation and tissue damage that

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,170
occurs it's basically the body attacking

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,829
itself instead of being directed with a

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,409
high degree of specificity to foreign

29
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,569
antigens that are invading the body now

30
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,030
a couple examples of autoimmune diseases

31
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,429
that you may have heard before but may

32
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,840
not kick in autoimmune diseases have a

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,299
couple listed here multiple sclerosis

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,790
type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis or

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,530
just some examples there's over 100

36
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,080
autoimmune diseases and I want you to

37
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,000
realize that they infect many different

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,009
components of the body they're not just

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,920
isolated to one region or one type of

40
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,859
tissue for example autism multiple

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,070
sclerosis is involved with the brain

42
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:43,170
leukemia involved with the blood we have

43
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,158
our celiac and Crohn's disease at the GI

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,599
tract fibromyalgia with the lungs so you

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,390
rheumatoid arthritis with the bones

46
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,000
there's many here and these are all

47
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,590
examples of autoimmune diseases with the

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,989
same basic principle where the body is

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,380
unable to distinguish self from non-self

50
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:03,319
and as a result sadly and self attacking

51
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,688
its own tissues causing inflammation

52
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,379
damage and as a result many different

53
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:09,379
types of diseases
