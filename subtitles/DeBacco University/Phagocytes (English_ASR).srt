1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,299
here we're gonna be looking at a portent

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,700
component of the immune system called

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,309
the phagocytes we see kind of a general

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,789
depiction here of phagocyte and a

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:14,339
foreign molecule being bound to being

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:17,669
destroyed and ultimately excreted here

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:20,070
as waste or as particles here so getting

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,679
into phagocytes they basically scan the

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,350
fluid areas of the body and macrophages

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,219
are one example and they are the chief

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,460
of

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,169
phagocytic cells in the body there are

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,549
free macrophages and they wander through

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,230
the regions in search of cellular debris

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,390
making the up to a hundred and meeting

16
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,979
cells before dying so here's just one

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,350
example here but macrophage is kind of

18
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,229
the web like fingers that come out and

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,510
attach to these foreign bacteria and

20
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,128
ultimately be destroying them so they

21
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,679
have that kind of binding that kind of

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,539
intake that lysosome to help destroy it

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,420
and then these I will debris is being

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,730
released through exocytosis and they can

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,780
kill up to basically a hundred invading

26
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:02,308
cells before they themselves um perish

27
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,250
yes I'm they called neutrophils and they

28
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:08,158
become a phagocyte addict when entering

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,900
infectious material so it's important to

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,150
help clean up the body to help prevent

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,650
potential infection they'll destroy

32
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,740
pathogens by breaking them down with

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,469
enzymes they died shortly after killing

34
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,239
the target cell so unlike our ones that

35
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,280
we saw before the macrophages

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,688
neutrophils they can't destroy hundreds

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,728
they died shortly after killing of the

38
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,649
cell the downfall is that these can

39
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,750
these neutrophils can also kill normal

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,270
healthy cells the collection of dead

41
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,188
neutrophils is also called pus if you're

42
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,780
a head that kind of area under the skin

43
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,429
that you can a poke and all that kind of

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,739
pus comes out what's actually a lot of

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,470
neutrophils they are the most abundant

46
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,569
white blood cells accounting for both 54

47
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:46,828
to 62 percent they're kind of that first

48
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,228
to come in to an infection and try to

49
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:51,149
clean it up as best that they can this

50
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,179
way they can be not quite as selective

51
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,368
as we saw with the macrophages the cinah

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,810
fills are weakly phagocyte addict

53
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,599
against parasitic worms they help

54
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,579
control inflammation increased activity

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,709
during parasite infection and older

56
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,359
check reactions these are the compiles

57
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,239
about one to three percent of white

58
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,038
blood cells here you can see not heavily

59
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,340
utilized by the immune system but still

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,669
offer another

61
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,039
a component of protection then we have

62
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:21,250
the mast cells and is binded in just a

63
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,929
wide range of bacteria they also release

64
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,639
histamine which if you have allergies

65
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,260
might be familiar with during

66
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,059
inflammation which is where it's

67
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,159
important but also as I said during

68
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,650
those allergic reactions those

69
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,109
histamines can kind of become overactive

70
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,150
and can kind of causes allergic kind of

71
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,370
reactions we have that's why a lot of

72
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,189
people take antihistamines to help mute

73
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,860
or reduce the impact that this has on

74
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:48,689
the body if it's over regulated it can

75
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,690
be quite the annoyance
