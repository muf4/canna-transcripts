00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,439
welcome to this debaco university

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,200
lecture video

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,440
today i'm going to be going over

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,880
genotype chemotype and phenotype as

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,120
relates to the breeding of

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
cannabis and to go over these three main

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,000
types and also provide you with some of

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
their advantages

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,399
and disadvantages of utilizing each so

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
first off breeding can be based on

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,079
three main categories here phenotype is

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
basically how the plants

13
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,679
look chemotype is the chemical profiles

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,480
that it produces

15
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,960
and genotype are the actual genetics so

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,520
again all these are different strategies

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,200
for breeding so first off we look at

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
phenotype and this is how the plant

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,359
grows

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
this is a result of how the genetics

21
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,878
interact with the environment

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,039
so if a plant has the genetics to grow

23
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,558
10 feet tall but it's constantly under

24
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,640
water or salt stress

25
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,199
the plant may only grow to be three feet

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,280
tall as a result the phenotype would be

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,719
three feet even though the genetics are

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,558
different in the sense that the genetics

29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,160
could produce ten feet tall plants

30
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,079
because the environment it may only

31
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,919
reach three feet tall

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,840
so what's the advantages to using a

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,960
phenotype selection for which is often

34
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
used by growers

35
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,159
well it's often used because there's no

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
specialized equipment needed

37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,118
growers can judge plants purely on the

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,400
performance for their given environment

39
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,680
if they keep the environment consistent

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
that can allow

41
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
different grow to grow comparisons

42
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
attentive growers can select one

43
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,400
individual out of many

44
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,079
so that is another advantage if

45
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,478
something is a genetic

46
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,840
standout in its look then that could be

47
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,000
those genetics could be preserved and

48
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
may be cloned and may be carried out

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
going further and bred in future

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
lineages

51
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,560
however the disadvantages of using

52
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
phenotype selection is that

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
resulting plants even if it's a clone

54
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
may not be the same

55
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,359
it's based only on the morphological

56
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,879
characteristics

57
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,879
this can also require an attentive

58
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,560
grower typically growing many plants

59
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,640
if it grows only growing a small number

60
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,640
of plants that can be more difficult

61
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
to go through the process of phenotype

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
selection

63
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
so then that brings us to chemotype

64
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
which is referring to the chemicals

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
produced by the plant

66
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,959
we have type 1 which is a high thc a

67
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,479
production plant

68
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,640
they have type 2 which is a balanced

69
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,718
ratio of cbd2 thc

70
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,680
and then type 3 is a high cbd production

71
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:11,120
plant now there's others that go further

72
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,920
and look at type 4 being cbg dominant

73
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
and type 5 being zero cannabis

74
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,199
cannabinoids

75
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,319
uh reduced number there in the sense

76
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,799
that those are looking more at

77
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,119
potentially

78
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,719
just producing terpenes and that the

79
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
cannabinoids

80
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,639
now the advantages to using this

81
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,959
chemotype breeding

82
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,479
is that you can know the classification

83
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
of the cannabinoid production

84
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,399
in that plant ideally it shows the

85
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,200
plants not producing the needed

86
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
compounds

87
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,399
to not be grown so that's a way to

88
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,439
select those and can speed up the

89
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
selection process

90
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,840
or especially early on in a breeding

91
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
program as far as kind of eliminating

92
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
those that are going to be a waste of

93
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,400
time

94
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,159
for the grower's desired traits but the

95
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,599
disadvantages with using

96
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,680
chemotype is that typically this

97
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,719
requires a specialized equipment

98
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
high resolution mass spec is a

99
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,080
kind of high-end piece of equipment that

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
might needed to really assess the

101
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
chemical profile

102
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,680
plants may change classification based

103
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,120
on generations of the breeding process

104
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
if a growers are selecting for one thing

105
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,400
or another it's based on what the plant

106
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,479
actually produces which can be

107
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,719
influenced by many environmental factors

108
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,639
so just another downfall to consider for

109
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,199
using chemotype breeding

110
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,839
then that leads us to genotype breeding

111
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,919
well

112
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,439
traits such as photoperiod dependence

113
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,719
and cannabinoids produced

114
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,120
can be strongly influenced by the

115
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,359
genotype of the plant so this is why

116
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,039
using the genes can be a very important

117
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
and powerful tool

118
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,639
the advantages to using genotype

119
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
breeding is that it's

120
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,479
very specific to the actual genetic code

121
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,479
it allows for quick and efficient

122
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,479
screening for targeted sequences

123
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,679
and can be performed at any stage of the

124
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,359
plant growth cycle

125
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,879
meaning the genetics of that plant the

126
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,799
seedling stage as well at the end

127
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,878
ideally will be just about the same

128
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,319
so therefore you're going to be able to

129
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,000
speed up the breeding process instead of

130
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,919
growing a plant all the way to term

131
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
you could grow a bunch of seedlings

132
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,798
screen them for their genetics and then

133
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,879
select out those

134
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,438
that don't have the particular sequences

135
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,000
deemed desirable by the grower

136
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,000
how are there also some disadvantages

137
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,360
and the disadvantage of using

138
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,360
genotype for breeding is that it can

139
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
require specialized equipment can also

140
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
be expensive

141
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,000
some coffee some companies are offering

142
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,680
genetic testing for a fee

143
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,918
other companies are going through doing

144
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,439
in-house with a lot of upfront cost

145
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,039
you also with genotype reading you need

146
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,680
to know what you're specifically looking

147
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
for

148
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,478
so you may be able to find the whole

149
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
genetic sequence or find certain

150
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,879
targeted sequences but

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,720
you need a way of detecting or knowing

152
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,199
what particular sequences you're

153
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
actually

154
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,840
looking for so with that this is just a

155
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,519
comparison here

156
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,000
how will you base your breeding strategy

157
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,319
on phenotype chemotype or genotype

158
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,839
each had its own pros and cons and you

159
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,000
can find videos on this

160
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,839
channel about each of these in more

161
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
detail so if you want to explore any of

162
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,079
them

163
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
further continue to search on this

164
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,000
channel and i'm sure you will find

165
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,758
some more information to allow you to

166
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,478
have the best breeding strategy going

167
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,479
forward
