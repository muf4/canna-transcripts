1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,359
in general genetics are becoming very

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
popular

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,119
and the same is holding true for the

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
cannabis industry so you ever wonder

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,120
what a cannabis breeder actually does

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,480
well this debaco university video will

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,359
go over some of the day-to-day

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,679
activities

9
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,879
and qualifications if you're considering

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,519
pursuing this as

11
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,519
a career

12
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,839
[Music]

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
all right let's take a look at a

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,000
cannabis breeder in action here

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
so first off what's the basic job

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,159
description of a cannabis breeder

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,360
well they're responsible for breeding

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,439
plants to purify

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,119
and strengthen strains and often can

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,599
combine strains or enhance

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,439
specific characteristics and those could

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120
be cannabinoids those could be terpene

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,558
profiles anything like that

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,479
we're talking about breeding we can be

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,238
looking at vegetative propagation we can

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,919
be looking at starting from seeds and

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,519
pollen transfer

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
so these are all involved in the

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
breeding process however their

30
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,839
day-to-day activities just in general

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,199
are often looking at studies the genetic

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
code of the plants

33
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,200
create new plant varieties eliminate

34
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,798
unwanted traits and that can be as

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,519
important as creating new varieties as

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
eliminating

37
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,359
unwanted traits something that's deemed

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
not desirable

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,719
develop reading schedules maintain a

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
budget and timelines

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,640
and utilize appropriate technologies as

42
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
far as where they're fit

43
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
also add kind of they can see here the

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
level of organization

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,680
and attention to detail are also

46
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,239
important qualities for that person to

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,479
have

48
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,158
as we can see presented right here other

49
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,400
qualities that person should have

50
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,920
uh is usually a bachelor's degree in

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,759
crop science

52
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
or agronomy which is the study of field

53
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
crops in some cases a master's or phd

54
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,279
may be required and that can depend

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
again on the facility you're choosing

56
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,478
to apply to or work at experience

57
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,158
working in a lab is

58
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,280
definitely very helpful as far as

59
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
learning some of the laboratory

60
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,840
techniques

61
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,959
ability to work with appropriate lab

62
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
equipment and understanding that

63
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,438
equipment good communicate communication

64
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,319
skills ability to focus and willingness

65
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,438
to learn

66
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,758
this is kind of where we see those

67
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,919
breeding strategies developing those f1

68
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,759
those f2s parental strains

69
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,200
developing those new varieties being

70
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,159
able to screen out the ones that aren't

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
performing well

72
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,159
all viable important qualities this

73
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,160
reader must have

74
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,199
so the connection uh to cannabis just in

75
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,719
general

76
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,399
is that chemist breeders pioneer the

77
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,239
industry by creating new

78
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,680
cultivars and strains breeding for

79
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
certain aspects from

80
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520
within the plant or within different

81
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
isolated plants

82
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,599
they're constantly pushing the

83
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,120
boundaries of what is possible in

84
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,919
regards to cannabinoid interpreting

85
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
content with

86
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,679
new developed cultivars and readers can

87
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,119
experiment with new combinations of

88
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,719
terpenes to direct

89
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,519
uh achieve desired uh results

90
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,400
in that plant and ultimately in that end

91
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,080
product

92
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,640
so again this is some great things we're

93
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,879
seeing a lot of a great advancement

94
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,559
and gets into the genetics understanding

95
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,039
those can really be a great way to

96
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
produce

97
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,400
new plants and looking at other breeding

98
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,878
aspects such as animals or other crops a

99
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,959
lot of that applies to cannabis as well

100
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,158
so if you like that kind of work that

101
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,719
kind of industry work

102
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,598
this can be a great job opportunity for

103
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,598
you to consider
