1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
so here we're looking at the flood and

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,599
drain system of hydroponics also can be

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,480
called the ebb and flow basic setup is

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,369
an area here where the plants are with a

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,349
water reservoir below the pump that will

6
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,570
pump the water up causing this trade

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,190
area to flood and then after a period of

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,140
time that water will drain that down

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,390
this is really set on a timer and this

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,179
will be repeated as needed depending on

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,310
the size of the plants so the

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,800
floundering system basics in more detail

13
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,649
on the hydroponic lecture this is the

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,090
same system is not unique to cloning so

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,789
you may have heard something like this

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,010
used for clones but it can also be used

17
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,558
a lot of times for the actual production

18
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,359
of the plants it can be scaled to match

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,640
operation size whether it's a small grow

20
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,450
tent or a very large operation this

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,759
system can be used in both situations as

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,559
well as a medium-sized operations the

23
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,939
systems include a table so we see here

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,609
where the plants are being supported a

25
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,679
pump right here water reservoir is not

26
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,089
pictured would go where the pump would

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,948
be sitting in that reservoir but I

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,809
removed that for the image and in the

29
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:06,420
growing media as we see here when the

30
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:08,579
plants are actively growing the basic

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,170
operation involves flooding part of the

32
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,810
root zone a landlord will wick up the

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,519
media before it drains away keep in mind

34
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,109
the flood only takes a short period of

35
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,209
time to saturate the media before it

36
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,159
drains away we're not holding that water

37
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:23,399
there for a very long period of time

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,040
typically 5 to 10 minutes at the most

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,478
this allows for adequate moisture by

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,829
still allowing the roots to breathe

41
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,659
because if we lift that water there for

42
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:34,258
too long the roots would essentially

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,420
drowned and not be able to respire now

44
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,060
we're using smaller operations or if

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,728
we're using this and clone operations it

46
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,040
can utilize humidity domes makes an easy

47
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,099
way to evenly water a large quantity of

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,118
clones efficiently and as I said it can

49
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,589
also be used for a large scale

50
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,930
production but because we are pumping

51
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,570
that water in from the bottom we can use

52
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,460
humidity domes if they are needed for

53
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,519
the growing environment that those

54
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,989
plants are being placed in the drawbacks

55
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,450
are that it's dependent on electrical

56
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,859
pumps and timers Ostrom set up there's

57
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,180
keeping the tray clean there's

58
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,098
installing the trailers getting the

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,439
right table all these come into the

60
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,598
flood and drain operation pH needs to be

61
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,829
monitored or many clones can be stunted

62
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,780
or killed this

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,570
can go for the full-size plants there

64
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,699
that we can also stunt or kill even

65
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,489
full-size plants it'll be much quicker

66
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,369
for clones due to their very weak root

67
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,570
systems now the oven flow or the flood

68
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,789
and drains is what it actually looks

69
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,099
like easy to use and very reliable

70
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:33,959
utilizes a growing table or bench in

71
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,599
this growing bed it recirculates a

72
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,520
nutrient solution to reduce loss of that

73
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,229
the solution floods the growing table

74
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,630
with 1 to 3 inches of nutrient solution

75
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,819
which is allowed to drain down the crop

76
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,340
and then refill the reservoir so what

77
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,359
happens here is this lower area here's

78
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,879
where the water will be pumped into

79
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,430
actively a pump and this simply will

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,780
allow a drain now this can be adjusted

81
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,000
based on height it can put another

82
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,890
spacer in here to make it even taller if

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,300
we would like what this means is that if

84
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,549
the pump for some reason was to

85
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,380
continually to run so if the timer was

86
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,700
to fail this would prevent the pump

87
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,799
pumping out all the water burning up the

88
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,509
pump and flooding the entire room here

89
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,640
this would automatically drain back down

90
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:13,289
now naturally when the pump turns off

91
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,539
what is great is that the water will

92
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:18,239
backflow back down the hose here and

93
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,189
refill the reservoir keep in mind that

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,860
you want to keep the size of the tubing

95
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,680
for the pump to be smaller than the size

96
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,530
of the tubing for the drain this way is

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,030
impossible for the pump to over

98
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,009
compensate for the amount of nutrient

99
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,409
solution that can drain back in as a

100
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,269
result this will maintain a very

101
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:38,069
consistent maximum height and then your

102
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,860
timer will adjust the amount of time

103
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,449
that water is spent here now this is I

104
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,280
said scalable the commutes from one

105
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:45,988
plant can use for you know a million

106
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,879
plus plants it's often used for

107
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,489
propagation and clones but can also be

108
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,139
used for large plants as well what makes

109
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,730
this so great is it is very easy to

110
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,839
automate and this is part of the reason

111
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:59,729
why it can be used at such a large scale

112
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,289
it's commonly used with rock wall as as

113
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:04,109
this offers the ability to flush the

114
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:06,449
system and pushes air out on the flood

115
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,070
so what happens as water comes in it

116
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,199
pushes the air out it has the water

117
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,810
drains away it can pull in fresh air

118
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,119
increasing the oxygen content within

119
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,798
those fibers in the root zone as water

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,899
drains away from that media that air is

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,060
being pulled in this increases the

122
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,679
potential for oxygen concentration to

123
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,470
help the roots breathe which is

124
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,780
advantageous for them it's increasing

125
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,210
the popularity we're using rock

126
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,829
or with the flood and drain grodan is a

127
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,709
very popular system to be used with

128
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:37,949
hydroponics as a result they have a

129
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:40,829
great lineup of products that allow

130
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,240
clones to be easily propagating them and

131
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:44,159
then stepped up to these larger blocks

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,590
and then you can go to even larger

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,020
blocks for a large-scale production so

134
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:51,388
the Rodian or rock wall is being

135
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,490
utilized in combination with ebb and

136
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,689
flow on a very large scale but it can

137
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,009
also be scaled down to smaller

138
00:04:54,689 --> 00:05:00,990
operations now there is a volume so this

139
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,089
typically system requires high volumes

140
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,310
of water but losses can be reduced with

141
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:06,569
sealable reservoirs keep in mind when we

142
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,339
are sitting at reservoir we don't want

143
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:10,560
to keep it completely airtight we just

144
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,019
want a lid over that to help reduce the

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,610
amount that may be lost to evaporation

146
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:18,359
because that can mean one way if we lose

147
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,889
that water at a very increased rate what

148
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,689
will happen is the nutrient solution may

149
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:24,089
become more concentrated in that

150
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:25,500
reservoir if it's not monitored so yeah

151
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,179
just a couple things to keep in mind

152
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,550
that evan flow is a very popular method

153
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,530
very efficient method and when that be

154
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,129
should be considered for any grow

155
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,129
operation
