1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
if you've looked at hydrocarbons to work

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,879
on extracting cannabis

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,199
one be cautious but two hopefully this

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,399
video here on tobacco university

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:17,920
will provide you a little bit more

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,920
detail with this extraction process

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,240
[Music]

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,400
all right let's look at extracting

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,640
cannabis with hydrocarbons

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,679
so the general description of the

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,920
extraction

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,278
method well it is a closed-loop system

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,719
and plant material is placed

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:37,039
in the extraction vessel and then cold

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,960
hydrocarbons such as butane or propane

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,640
is washed through the plant material

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,399
you kind of see that here we have a kind

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
of a column example

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
the waxes fats and lipids from the

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
cannabis bind to the hydrocarbon and the

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,479
plant material is then

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,159
removed the resulting mixture is then

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,640
cold boiled in a vacuum

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,119
and the butane evaporates as butane and

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,520
propane have very low boiling points

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,399
then the resulting extract is collected

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,399
so we kind of again

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,600
see here we have the solvents chill down

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
the low temperatures

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,118
some washes over cam is packed into a

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,719
column okay

32
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,239
the cannabis and terpenes separate from

33
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,400
that plant

34
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,158
material and they create kind of a crude

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
oil we have the collection tank where

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
the solvent crude oil mixture enters

37
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,000
and then heat is applied to evaporate

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
the solvent and then we kind of see the

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,879
crude oil being collected

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,560
and then a compressor pulls the

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,599
evaporated solvent pulls out of the tank

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
condenser tank

43
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,959
condensing cools solvent vapors

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
back into a liquid form and the solvent

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,839
can be turned back and can have this

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
closed-loop system

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
so in theory it seems pretty pretty good

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,719
pretty efficient

49
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,478
and it can be but again we're dealing

50
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,118
with hydrocarbons and butane

51
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,799
uh be cautious with those so what's the

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,359
resulting end product well that

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,118
resulting

54
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,599
end product of hydrocarbons come from a

55
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,040
variety of forms textures consistencies

56
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,640
based on the protocol that's actually

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
used we're all

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
compressed by the broad term butane hash

59
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,399
oil

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,679
examples in end products are shatter

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,359
batter and crumble

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
cannabinoid concentrations average

63
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,399
between the 80 to 90 percent

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
range so one of the advantages of this

65
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
system

66
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,719
was that it does preserve the terpene

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
and cannabinoid content very efficiently

68
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,400
compared to other methods there are a

69
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,719
wide range of extract types that can be

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,719
achieved through hydrocarbon extraction

71
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,800
and it can be done with trim and flower

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,759
it also has relatively low equipment in

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,520
run cost

74
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,799
as we kind of see here a simplified

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
version of that system

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
however with any system there are

77
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,839
disadvantages and one of those

78
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,640
disadvantages we'll put in kind of all

79
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
caps here

80
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,759
it can be extremely dangerous butane pro

81
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,360
and propane are highly flammable and

82
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,518
extreme caution must be used when

83
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,920
extracting with hydrocarbons

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,439
also unwanted compounds could make it

85
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,518
through the extraction process

86
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,039
it would need to be later refined so

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,400
keep that in mind as well

88
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,479
so let's talk a little bit about

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
hydrocarbon extraction if you are

90
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,919
kind of looking at it definitely make

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
sure that you are cautious

92
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,839
when utilizing this make sure you

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,039
understand your equipment very well

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,039
so you don't create a very dangerous

95
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,039
situation
