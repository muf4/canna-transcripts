00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,199
we're going to look at two main options

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
when it comes to

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:17,920
taking down canvas plants for the

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,920
initiation of the harvesting process

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,479
all right let's get a canvas plant take

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,960
down options for harvest to see which

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,359
one

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
might fit your situation so when it

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,320
comes to harvesting

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,518
the plants camus plants are typically

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,278
large and bulky

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,039
so when it comes to removing them it can

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,640
present many challenges

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,359
while there are a couple options the end

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,039
goal and result is essentially the same

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,878
of kind of getting them ready for that

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,759
drying and ultimately that curing

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,878
process so what about the size of your

20
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,079
operations these are important

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,919
considerations

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
depending on the size of your operation

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,719
this may essentially make the decision

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,239
for you if you

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,399
if you should go with kind of a manual

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,320
harvest option or if you go with a

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,719
mechanized harvest option

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,480
now this does not necessarily mean large

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,399
operations always need to be

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,158
mechanically harvested but you need to

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
make sure you have the right labor

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,760
for it smaller operations so should

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
stick typically with the manual harvest

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,680
because it just becomes too cumbersome

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
to work potentially with mechanized

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
harvesting larger operations have a

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
choice

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,879
of kind of mechanized is a staff if

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,319
you're staff limited

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,000
or go with the manual roof there's

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,399
enough people to make this process

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,560
feasible this also comes into play with

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,960
where you can get the equipment in

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,719
so even large indoor grow operations can

45
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,519
be very difficult to get equipment into

46
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,078
these rooms

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,078
so a lot of times they are forced into

48
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,000
the manual harvest option

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,359
simply just because of the space

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
constraints

51
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,159
so if we're looking at manual harvest

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,079
well the advantage is that it does not

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
require any specialized equipment

54
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,279
allows for growers to specifically

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,759
harvest sections of

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
the plant the disadvantages is very time

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,719
consuming

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,159
and does require the most labor and

59
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,438
that's kind of constant labors you're

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,359
going through harvesting

61
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,718
stacking removing all the pots going

62
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,920
through that and that regards here with

63
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,679
the indoor operation

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
same so with an outdoor operation it

65
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
does require that kind of

66
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,559
stacking removing and that kind of

67
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,359
constantly handling and touching the

68
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,000
plants

69
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,560
there's also though mechanized options

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
here

71
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,239
typically done with large scale hemp but

72
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
it's a very quick method

73
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,599
can be very efficient for large scale

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
operations as we see here with again the

75
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,639
large-scale hemp operation

76
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,878
disadvantages it does require

77
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,399
specialized equipment as we see here

78
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,159
and it can damage buds and plant

79
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,560
material because again it doesn't have

80
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,560
that delicate touch necessarily

81
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,759
but sometimes the advantages outweigh

82
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,598
the disadvantages

83
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,518
so depending on your growing operation

84
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,518
whatever plant takedown

85
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
option for harvest you think best fits

86
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
your situation

87
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
you can search this channel and get more

88
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,800
details on that particular

89
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,000
method of harvesting or taking down your

90
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
cannabis plants
