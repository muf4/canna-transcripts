1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,160
going to go over beneficial insects if

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,400
you identify spider mites in your

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,800
cannabis production plants and how to go

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,280
about best controlling them without the

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,280
use of insecticides

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,479
[Music]

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
all right let's get into the video here

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
so you've identified spider mites you

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,920
want to control them this hopefully will

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,679
provide some help for you

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
so first off this is all based off of a

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,759
research article welcome to look at this

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,120
they look at more than just spider mites

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,039
so if you have an idea of materials

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,878
methods some more details i welcome you

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,558
to check out the reference here with the

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,320
link provided

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,238
so first off insects can be a challenge

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,719
in greenhouse production in general and

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,718
they can cause many losses often

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,198
synthetic chemicals have been used as an

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,359
option but with the medical cannabis

24
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,960
kind of cultivation and strict

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,960
legalizations and restrictions on the

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
use of those pesticides in most case for

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,799
a good reason this is the driving force

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
between the development of new

29
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,198
environmentally friendly but yet

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,879
profitable methods of pest control

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,959
so this greenhouse study was conducted

32
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,798
at university agriculture university of

33
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,478
athens they looked at two different

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
greenhouses one that had the beneficial

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,560
insects and one that basically did not

36
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,438
this is the minuses variety they were

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
using as well as the

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,438
general greenhouse environmental

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,118
conditions that those plants and insects

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,559
were experiencing

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,560
now beneficial insects the general

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
release date uh three weeks after

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
transplantation beneficial insects were

44
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,158
released into the treatment greenhouse

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,920
in order to assess the efficiency of the

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
biological control pest management

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,879
strategy

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,478
so spider mites this study specifically

49
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,438
looked at spider mites that we can see

50
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,118
right here

51
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,758
particularly the two spotted spiromites

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,840
is what was studied uh here and that's

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,359
the information that'll be presented on

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
throughout the the article in

55
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:56,159
presentation here probably abbreviated

56
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,919
as tssm first two spotted spider mites

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
so basic measurements

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,519
you're looking at include visual

59
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,879
estimations of the infestation the

60
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,640
recording of pest species and

61
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,118
populations in the comparison of

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,878
infestations between the two greenhouses

63
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,598
only the nymphs and adult stages of the

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,039
pests were counted no egg stage and this

65
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,238
just shows you what some of the insects

66
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,639
look like

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
in comparison spider mites again being

68
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,279
this

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,120
a here but you could see some of the

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,878
other insects for comparison that were

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
part of the study

72
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,079
so how were the pest populations

73
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,159
determined well measurements of the

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,719
pests were taken in the third fifth

75
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,560
seventh and ninth week and the spider

76
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,479
mites were counted of the handheld

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,840
digital 1 1600x microscope in order to

78
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,759
quantify the efficiency of the

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,680
beneficial insects average pest

80
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,878
populations were measured in 10 plants

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,519
four leaves per plant per greenhouse

82
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,199
so it's important on any insect or

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,719
passage you're looking at controlling is

84
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,759
to have an understanding of the life

85
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,280
cycle

86
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,120
i have a basic kind of idea of what

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,598
you're looking at the life cycle as well

88
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,039
as key identifying characteristics so i

89
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,959
welcome you to pause the video here if

90
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,679
you want to read this in any more detail

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,360
but just kind of some highlights there

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
two spotted spider mites they're

93
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
technically not insects they're related

94
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,959
to spiders because they have eight legs

95
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,920
and they can go through five stages in

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,199
about two weeks so they can multiply

97
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,199
very quickly and go through this

98
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,958
progression although spider mites can

99
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,318
have two color phases so keep in mind

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,759
that you're not looking for one

101
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:26,798
particular color um and they all can do

102
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,719
very varying amounts of damage there so

103
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
again take a pause read through this if

104
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,000
you want to learn more about uh spider

105
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,238
mites because you want to know the enemy

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
you're trying to combat

107
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
so going on the beneficial insects

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,840
specifically to target these uh spider

109
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,518
mites um so here are the beneficial

110
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,479
insects and this is neocilocus uh

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,000
californicus uh this is

112
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,840
significantly cooler and warmer

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
temperatures will slow or inhibit the

114
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
production of their development so keep

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,799
that in mind higher humidity is

116
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,640
generally necessary with higher

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,400
temperatures however the californians

118
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,559
can persist in low humidity environments

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,280
with limited food sources which makes it

120
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,360
a great beneficial insect to choose the

121
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
slower pace that these predatory mites

122
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
feed

123
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,080
five mites per day and their ability to

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,318
sustain themselves on pollen it allows

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,799
them to survive for longer when you have

126
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,599
lower pest populations the full life

127
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,759
cycle of calif for forking franicus can

128
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
last between one to two weeks and is

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
significantly influenced by temperature

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
so keep that in mind if you're in a

131
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,400
greenhouse environment what season you

132
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,040
might be considering applying these then

133
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,638
we have another one here this is a

134
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,879
fellow tila

135
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
formerly known as a different name so

136
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,600
again maybe do some research as far as

137
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
you know looking at both names

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,240
that's what it's currently known as this

139
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,839
is a pink brown predatory midge and can

140
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,600
only gets about two millimeters long

141
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,198
it's about one twelfth of an inch the

142
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
antennae of the male insect are covered

143
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
with long hairs with those of the female

144
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,879
shorter and thicker so good if you're

145
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
using a magnifying loop which would be

146
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,159
recommended the female adult lays eggs

147
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,519
inside a spider-mite colonies the larvae

148
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
begin to pry on the spider mites

149
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,519
immediately after hatching the young

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,919
larvae feed mainly on the spider my eggs

151
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,439
and older larvae feed on all stages of

152
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,560
the mites so you kind of get that

153
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,399
multiple life cycle benefit or control

154
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,240
the larvae eat about 50 spider mites

155
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,120
before pupating and the larvae are

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,879
creamy yellowy brown colorations again

157
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,038
between a quarter to two millimeters

158
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,199
long the pupae can be found inside the

159
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,360
white cocoons along the veins of the

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,520
leaves if you're doing inspections as

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
you should be of your particular

162
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,799
cannabis leaves

163
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,199
now for that two-spotted spider-mite

164
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,199
control the predators were applied by

165
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,879
hanging slow release satchets as we can

166
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
kind of see right here each of these

167
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,120
contains about 100 predatory

168
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
and storage mites of the californians

169
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,319
per cannabis plant

170
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,478
the other ones here they are introduced

171
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,959
by making a hole in the lid located

172
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,639
directly in the middle of the greenhouse

173
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,079
so you have to be mindful as far as

174
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,800
these beneficial insects it's not an

175
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,399
insecticide you don't just mix and apply

176
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,720
here we're looking at different methods

177
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,439
of application to allow the greatest

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,919
benefit for those

179
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,079
beneficial insects to go about attacking

180
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,758
in this case your spider mites

181
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,839
now looking at the data from the actual

182
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,439
study here for two spotted spider mites

183
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,439
plants treated with beneficial insects a

184
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,519
dramatic decline in might pipe

185
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,680
populations this gives you the data

186
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,000
table but the graph really shows it here

187
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,079
week three remember both greenhouses the

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,918
control which had no spider my

189
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,519
beneficial insects added and the

190
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,038
treatment which would have those added

191
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,719
were initially right around the same

192
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,159
level now looking here at the

193
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,919
progression spreader mites definitely

194
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,680
increased dramatically dipped a little

195
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,000
bit in control but we can see the

196
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,478
treatment group really a great decrease

197
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,319
here by week nine right here

198
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,918
there was less than two spider mites per

199
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
plant on average for those plants

200
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,159
treated with the beneficial insects

201
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,720
compared to over 75 in the control

202
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,280
plants so this massive decrease and

203
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,000
significantly different decrease as well

204
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,478
all great that these beneficial insects

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,399
are definitely worth the time and effort

206
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,079
they are to apply

207
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,478
average number of pest populations here

208
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,879
we can see those numbers uh in general

209
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,079
kind of how they were able to be reduced

210
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,759
over time

211
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,199
and these are numbers and weeks a

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,560
continuous reduction all pest

213
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,478
populations was observed throughout the

214
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,478
experiment approaching zero value per

215
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,240
plant now i did look at other insects i

216
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,719
will have other videos on those

217
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,879
but this just shows you that spider mite

218
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
population decrease

219
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,759
now not mentioned in the study here was

220
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,079
a persimilis

221
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,560
now these do a little bit better i will

222
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,680
admit when there is webbing involved

223
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,280
so they can be a little bit more of a

224
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
benefit in that factor if your spirits

225
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,719
have developed that protective webbing

226
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,318
they do want to try to break that as

227
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
much as you can

228
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479
the release of these as the first sign

229
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,160
of might infestations is advised once

230
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,719
leaf damage is serious more than four

231
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
mites per leaf achieving the control is

232
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,720
more difficult so keep that in mind you

233
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
want to try to catch these early

234
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,080
persimmons these are red in color

235
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,000
relative to the pest mites and they feed

236
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,079
on and are best used to combat active

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,918
mite populations but this will leave the

238
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,598
area in search of alternate food sources

239
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,000
if pest

240
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,918
populations drop between a lower level

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,918
so again keep that in mind that your

242
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,839
pest population is too low or you're

243
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,598
just seeing it this may not be your best

244
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,758
option some of the other ones mentioned

245
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,360
would be advised

246
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,360
now our beneficial insects worth the

247
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,038
effort will ensure yes the study

248
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
indicates that beneficial insects could

249
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,959
control pest populations up to 100

250
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,959
percent pest management with natural

251
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,198
enemies is very promising very effective

252
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,439
safe method for plant protection as well

253
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,038
as applicator production

254
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,320
now what growers do need to keep in mind

255
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,479
if you are considering this which

256
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
hopefully you are is that proper pest

257
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,080
identification is important since this

258
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,918
will determine the exact beneficial

259
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
insect you're going to utilize this

260
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,079
requires frequent scouting timing and

261
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080
rates of beneficial additions are

262
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,040
important so the remember you're dealing

263
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,600
with a biological system so keeping the

264
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,759
right species the timing and matching

265
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,159
the species with your pest and the

266
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,200
degree of severity of the problem is all

267
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,519
important to achieve a very effective

268
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,519
environmentally sustainable control

269
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,519
method
