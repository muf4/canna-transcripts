1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,068
here we take a brief look at organic

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,799
hydroponic production - producing a

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:11,519
hydroponic grow with organic based

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,250
nutrients now growing hydroponically and

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,449
organically can present some challenges

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,640
organic nutrients can take longer to

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,349
become plant available so in hydroponics

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,670
where fruits may be only exposed to

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,350
nutrient solutions for very short

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,160
periods of time this is something to

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,810
keep in mind

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,028
organic based products can be less

13
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,250
stable in solution resulting in a

14
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:32,820
greater chance for a potential shift in

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,799
pH or EC electrical conductivity changes

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,719
that could occur so just keep these two

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,628
things in mind especially when growing

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,129
hydroponically organic nutrients can

19
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:43,259
also have more particulate than other

20
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,119
nutrients which can clog systems and

21
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,099
lead to more frequent operation

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,140
cleanings so again this is necessarily a

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,030
bad thing but just keep in mind that if

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,128
you are switching to more organic based

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,780
nutrient solutions there's a chance that

26
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,460
they might contain more particulate so

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,730
according to change filters more often

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,980
or to keep make sure that the spray

29
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,538
nozzles are clean I make sure that it

30
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,250
may have more of a muddy or water or

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,890
look to that and this made custom routes

32
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,140
to potentially not look pure white they

33
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,180
could have a slight teeth kind of color

34
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,890
to them now it could be a sign of

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,100
disease but often times if you're using

36
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,170
organic production as a very strong deep

37
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,359
coloration to the water that's going to

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,070
tinge the color of the roots yeah and

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,739
not necessary a bad thing just something

40
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,879
to keep in mind lastly we also want to

41
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,589
be mindful that just because you're

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,199
growing organically doesn't mean you

43
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,150
can't pollute it's the same as chemical

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,978
fertilizers if you're not careful so

45
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,930
still keeping an eye on the nutrients

46
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,478
that you're adding and knowing how much

47
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,420
it you're adding in eliminating runoff

48
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,840
can also keep your plants healthy keep

49
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,299
your plants doing well but also not

50
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,200
contributing to environmental

51
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,520
contaminations especially with

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,740
hydroponically with a lot of water based

53
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,359
solutions we want to be mindful for

54
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,000
changing their solutions out to not just

55
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,430
dump them down the drain I'm gonna try

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,409
to get the maximum we want for

57
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,759
efficiency at the plant but also so

58
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,868
we're not wasting anything in

59
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,700
contributing to groundwater

60
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,560
contamination especially with phosphorus

61
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,689
that's true for both organic and

62
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,370
inorganic operations but our gimmicks

63
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,500
can also pollute so again

64
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,240
run those numbers double-check

65
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,870
just to make sure you're operating in a

66
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,870
sustainable way
