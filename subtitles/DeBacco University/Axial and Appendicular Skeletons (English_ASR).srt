1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
so this is going to be a brief overview

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:07,349
of the axial and appendicular skeleton

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,539
of the human body the axial skeleton or

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,239
bones of the skull vertebral column and

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,428
rib cage we see here highlighted in blue

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,839
we're going to spend more time in other

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,969
videos learning about these in more

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,399
detail but for right now just know this

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,589
is part of the axial skeleton in

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,939
contrast the appendicular skeleton are

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,160
both of the upper and lower limbs

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,039
shoulder and hip highlighted in the pink

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,018
red color here and also these looping on

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,179
over in more detail right now just

15
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,320
important identify these two different

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,460
subcategories of the human skeleton

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,530
looking a little more specifically at

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,140
the axial skeleton what that's composed

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,640
of they said the skulls many bones and

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,989
composed skull the vertebral column

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,808
we're gonna learn about the different

22
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:52,259
regions they're in the thoracic ribcage

23
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:54,299
and how these different ribs differ the

24
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,359
access gelatin supports and protects

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,799
organs in body cavities in touches the

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,350
muscles of the head the neck and the

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,419
trunk it's important for respiration and

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,939
attachment of muscles as part of the

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,409
appendicular skeleton speaking of the

30
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,629
appendicular skeleton these are some of

31
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,400
the bones here you should be come

32
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,589
familiar with and be able to identify

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,840
these the clavicle the scapula the

34
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,520
humerus the radius the ulna the hip bone

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,469
the carpals the metacarpals the

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,199
phalanges the femur the patella the

37
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,750
tibia the fibula tarsals metatarsals and

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,359
phalanges are just the basic overview of

39
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,549
the appendicular skeleton and all these

40
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,519
bones minimum you should be able to

41
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,770
identify again this is just that quick

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,199
overview of axial appendicular skeleton

43
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,149
with other videos to provide with more

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,618
details on the different regions within

45
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,618
these skills
