1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
okay here we're going to talk about the

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,639
topic of drug addiction and what we may

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,649
think of that as being synthetic drugs

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,899
or illegal drugs keep in mind this cup

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,530
of coffee has caffeine and this can also

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,179
be considered or classified as a drug

7
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:17,698
drugs in general we're looking at there

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,560
are neuromodulators which are chemicals

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,179
that prolong the effect of

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,528
neurotransmitters by either eating in

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,899
their release preventing their

12
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,939
reabsorption and for an example

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,879
depression may be caused by a shortage

14
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,429
of serotonin prozac inhibits that

15
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:35,789
reabsorption so here we are in kind of

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:38,780
the synapse here with prozac inhibiting

17
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:42,179
the reabsorption of that serotonin

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,058
molecule there again acting as a neural

19
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,039
modulator drug addiction in general

20
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,078
cells that are exposed to chemical

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,480
signals for a long time lose their

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,640
sensitivity so what does this mean the

23
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,558
sensitivity well they lose their ability

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,530
to respond to the stimulus with the

25
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,570
original intensity so while we can have

26
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,640
a normal kind of going on here where

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,140
we've got releasing we've got in that

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,599
synapse here that gap between the two

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,500
neurons we've got that interaction

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,469
occurring however here we see that nerve

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,959
cells are particularly prone to the loss

32
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,548
of this sensitivity and what does that

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,349
look at a molecular scale if we look at

34
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,420
the arrow here pointing to this kind of

35
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,709
receptor we can see those molecules are

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,049
free to move through this kind of

37
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,780
protein here

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,439
that proteins being blocked so this is a

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,650
change in the way the body is perceiving

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,969
or releasing an absorbing in this case

41
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,630
serotonin so this leaves more serotonin

42
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,039
to flow around in that synapse typically

43
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,140
cells will respond to high

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,229
neurotransmitter exposure by inserting

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,739
fewer protein receptors so we're having

46
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:52,709
this altered protein receptor amount due

47
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,868
which is altering ultimately altering

48
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,218
the amount of neurotransmitters left in

49
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:59,280
that synapse and we can see over time

50
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,048
how this addiction occurs usually not

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,899
just once curse over time because

52
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:08,129
there's this change or this shift in the

53
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:11,038
actual protein of receptors cocaine as

54
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,560
an example here addiction occurs with

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,269
chronic exposure to a drug that induces

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,199
nervous system to act in a physiological

57
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,430
way cocaine is a neuromodulator it

58
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,719
causes large amounts of

59
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,459
neurotransmitters to remain in the

60
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,169
synapse for a long period of time so

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,060
kind of what we saw the previous image

62
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,639
this is just an example of a drug that

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,409
does perform in that way dopamine

64
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,689
transmits pleasure messages to the body

65
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,189
and high levels for long periods and

66
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,889
causing nerve cells to lower the number

67
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,229
of receptors and this is why I typically

68
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,238
cocaine users need to use more and more

69
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:45,359
to get the same effect

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,430
sadly through just one use or definitely

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,280
if you're increasing the dose that

72
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,739
increases the odds of dying from cocaine

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,479
we can see it sadly this number of

74
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,500
deaths from cocaine comparing males to

75
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:02,459
females over a number of years at THC

76
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,949
the psychoactive drug found in cannabis

77
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,189
plants which makes it classified as

78
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,988
marijuana it mimics under another

79
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,799
neurotransmitter that we have in our

80
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:16,709
body causing effects to the body

81
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,769
those effects would be increased in

82
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,500
sensory intensity of perceived sensory

83
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,269
data what does that kind of mean it kind

84
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,579
of gives the sense of emotional

85
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,799
well-being in reduced concentration or

86
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,010
impaired judgment of both time and space

87
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,010
how it kind of works on a molecular

88
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,750
level here is normally we have our cells

89
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:38,729
that may produce in inhibitory

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,769
neurotransmitters they're represented

91
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:42,750
here by the little blue triangles they

92
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,139
prevent don't build they prevent

93
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,060
dopamine it's secretion however here

94
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,030
we're having this block of those

95
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,579
inhibitory neurotransmitters it's

96
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,189
inhibiting the inhibitors as a result

97
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,260
the dopamine is being released and binds

98
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,079
to the receptors here we're having this

99
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,599
kind of a loss of regulation well what

100
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,090
THC does is it mimics that same kind of

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,358
molecular shape and fits into that same

102
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,670
receptor causing the same effect however

103
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,530
in this case with the green we're having

104
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,719
eight naturally occurring in natural

105
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,449
balances occurring in this case we're

106
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,000
having a artificial occurrence which is

107
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,769
causing that impair judgment of time and

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,189
space and that feeling of emotional

109
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,120
well-being then we get to tobacco which

110
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,779
is involved

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,720
nicotine receptors they never ly serve

112
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,579
to bind a secede Oh chlorine the brain

113
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,770
adjusts tap along exposure of nicotine

114
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,810
by making fewer nicotine receptors and

115
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,810
altering the pattern of activation of

116
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,180
those nicotine receptors so having an a

117
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,579
change in the physiological response and

118
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,439
also a reduction in the total receptors

119
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,509
addiction occurs because the brain

120
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,279
experiences nicotine induced changes to

121
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,409
protein expression in the synaptic

122
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,359
connections there's no real easy way to

123
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,930
quit the only way to quit is to quit and

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,460
of course that's easier said than done

125
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,519
lastly looking at nicotine it's actually

126
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,379
it's a natural insecticide produced by

127
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,269
the tobacco plant so the tobacco plants

128
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,089
actually producing nicotine to help

129
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:13,288
prevent it from insect damage it's

130
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,948
synthetic forms of nicotine have been

131
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:17,339
produced

132
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,990
they're called new nicotine and they are

133
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,319
potential risk to reduce in bee

134
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,019
populations however their use across the

135
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,089
country is quite extensive so we're

136
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:29,939
having this particular insecticide being

137
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:30,989
spread over large areas so that's a

138
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,870
concern with anything where we

139
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,939
potentially could get resistance built

140
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,348
up to that or damage to our very

141
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,348
important be pollinators
