1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,040
okay this video is going to look at some

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,139
of the nonspecific cell their responses

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,910
of the immune system now they're all

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,000
listed here such as physical barriers

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,190
besides extracellular killing

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,320
inflammatory response fever

7
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:19,559
interferons in the complement system and

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,390
a focus mainly on fever and some of the

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,299
brief overviews a lot of these can also

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,920
be found in other videos they're what

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,260
they all have in common is nonspecific

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,118
cell response it's kind of like the

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,239
spider putting the web out here or

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,679
casting out the cast net nonspecific

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,500
just kind of catching whatever comes

16
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,500
through here the lot of these systems

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,189
just kind of kill or prevent sources of

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,460
infection

19
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,869
none of them are very specific so this

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,420
is what we're talking with nonspecific

21
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,328
cell responses they are still providing

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,309
very important functions but they're non

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,079
specific here can be classified

24
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:58,409
sometimes that part of that innate

25
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,299
immune system when we're born with so

26
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,640
this second line defense mobilized and

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,530
quickly is inflammatory responses also

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,140
kind of falls into this category the

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,960
body uses non specific cellular chemical

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,819
devices to protect itself they can be

31
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,250
phagocytes and natural killer cells

32
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,489
there'll be a whole separate deal on

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,769
those antimicrobial proteins in blood

34
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:22,349
and tissue fluid inflammatory response

35
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,599
can be macrophages mast cells white

36
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,849
blood cells and chemicals it's important

37
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,188
to keep in mind that harmful substances

38
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:32,728
are identified by surface carbohydrates

39
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:37,889
unique to infectious organisms as we see

40
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:39,900
here are cell phospholipid bilayer has

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,180
many things it's not just a phospholipid

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,000
bilayer there are many surface

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,799
carbohydrates here so a lot going on in

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,489
the surface and that's very important

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,880
for cell to cell communication in part

46
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:56,669
that is how certain cells are able to

47
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,500
determine cells that ourself and

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,670
shouldn't be destroyed or foreign

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,069
invaders that do not belong in the body

50
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,189
one we're to focus on here is a fever

51
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,840
again a nonspecific response here well

52
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,639
abnormally high body temperature in

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,920
response to invading organisms it's kind

54
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,589
of the definition of a fever here

55
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,859
the body's thermostat is reset upwards

56
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,500
so normal body temperature it's about 37

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,530
degrees Celsius or 98.6 degrees

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,150
Fahrenheit in pyrogens are chemical

59
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,129
secreted by leukocytes and macrophages

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,400
when exposed to bacteria and other

61
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:35,219
foreign substances part the hypothalamus

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,409
located here in the brain regulates body

63
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,239
temperature when your body is inducing a

64
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,068
fever it's up regulating that

65
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,039
temperature it's getting at above ninety

66
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:46,199
eight point six degrees on average now

67
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,150
as we notice our as we know certain

68
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,579
proteins can denature at very high

69
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,620
temperatures so we're saying raising the

70
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,260
body temperature well we may feel

71
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,709
extremely hot it's not necessarily gonna

72
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:01,439
move all that much reason being for our

73
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,090
fever if we have a high fever they're

74
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,879
extremely dangerous because they can

75
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,830
denature our own enzymes so here's our

76
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,159
normal body temperature and see a

77
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,019
medical emergency to get too hot also

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,479
hypothermic we get too cold fevers are

79
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,370
not used to directly kill the invaders

80
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,979
because fever is greater than forty

81
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,069
point six degrees Celsius or 105 degrees

82
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,750
Fahrenheit are often fatal so we don't

83
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,599
want to elevate our temperature much

84
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,569
above that was will denature our own

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,030
enzymes however what our body does is

86
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,699
with a moderate feeder can be beneficial

87
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,169
we were moderate not high the primary

88
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,149
benefit is an increase in the metabolic

89
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,339
rate which speeds up tissue repair

90
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,689
although every degree in temperature

91
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,689
equals ten times

92
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,039
metabolic increase also by increasing

93
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:49,079
the temperature in the metabolic rate

94
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,289
can also cause the liver and spleen to

95
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,269
sequester iron and zinc which are needed

96
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,939
by Moke microorganisms when it means

97
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,390
sequester it means can it bind up in use

98
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,949
this may help slow infectious growth so

99
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,259
as much as we think a hot fever is

100
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,639
destroying all the invaders by just keep

101
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,729
killing them and denaturing all their

102
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,858
enzymes may not be 100% the case because

103
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,138
if we get too hot we will delete her our

104
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,150
own enzymes what's really helping with

105
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,549
is increasing the metabolic rate yes

106
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,530
some enzymes may be denatured or at

107
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,328
least are reduced in their effectiveness

108
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,250
but we're really looking at the

109
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,918
metabolic rate speeding up repair and

110
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,899
helping slow the growth of infectious

111
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,469
organisms by sequestering I

112
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,469
music
