00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
here in this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,278
i'll be going over some general

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,200
fertilizer considerations

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:17,118
that apply to really any fertilizer you

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,399
might be adding to your plants

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,160
all right let's go over some general for

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,278
lesser considerations for cannabis

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,640
production

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,160
so first off we want to consider the

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,199
general fertilizer ratio and the

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,560
dilution

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,760
so as a general guide two to one to two

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,518
which is the n

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,359
phosphorus uh potential sorry the

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,799
nitrogen phosphorous potassium ratio is

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,759
often considered to be the standard for

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,078
cannabis

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,399
and that could be a two one two or a

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,679
twenty ten twenty or a whole other host

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,679
of potential

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,238
nutrients there could be a ten 5 10 as

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,840
well regarding concentrations

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,919
manufacturers recommendations should

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
provide a good starting point

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
and use those as kind of maximums you

26
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,000
can go a little bit lower than that and

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
then

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,198
see how your plants respond and your

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
work your way up to that

30
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,878
this i don't want to go much higher than

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
the general recommendations

32
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,118
by the manufacturer because it could

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
lead to other issues with your plants

34
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,239
then the fertilizer concentration check

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
once you go through and do the math and

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,519
dilute it out

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,039
in general an ec or parts per million

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,200
meter can be used to check the

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,960
concentrations of nutrient solution

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,359
it's good to kind of have the secondary

41
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,959
device electronic

42
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,599
connectivity or you see or parts per

43
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,478
million ppm meters measure the salts in

44
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,839
the water

45
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:31,039
for example tap water could have a 0.4

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,600
or about 200 parts per million ratio the

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,159
nutrient solution example should be 1.3

48
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,839
or around 650 parts per million again

49
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,799
just to give you an idea of how

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,118
concentrated

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,799
your actual nutrient solution is because

52
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,200
if it's too concentrated that could

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,200
cause

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
issues to the plants could cause some

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
unnecessary stress of the plants

56
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,399
depending on the stage of growth for

57
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,000
example if you're talking early on

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,359
clones or seedlings

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
we want to be really mindful of that

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,319
continually monitoring that so don't

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,359
risk damaging

62
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,718
that entire crop and then using the

63
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,359
meter so when we're going through and

64
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,359
using

65
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,040
whatever chosen manufacturer meter we

66
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,478
use the goal is to measure the water

67
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
being given to the plants

68
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,080
and is also what is coming out of the

69
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,439
container or substrate

70
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
this will help growers dial in their

71
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,759
feeding concentrations so they can

72
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
maximize plant production while limiting

73
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,039
nutrients

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,120
lost or wasted meaning if you know x

75
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,159
amount is going into the plants in any

76
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
of your container

77
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,680
and you measure what's kind of coming

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,000
out at the bottom you can have an idea

79
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
of

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,598
what you may or may not be over

81
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,159
fertilizing with if you've got a lot

82
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,079
coming in

83
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,759
a lot coming out well you might want to

84
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,680
reduce the amount that goes in

85
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,439
to try to allow plants a chance to

86
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,480
uptake those nutrients to be utilized

87
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,719
instead of being

88
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,318
flushed through and wasted that's a

89
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,159
great way using that meteor of both your

90
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,878
irrigation water as well as your pour

91
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,680
through water

92
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,280
to get an idea to better dial in your

93
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,879
particularly growing situation to

94
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,759
maximize plant efficiency

95
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,959
while minimizing losses that could

96
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,280
contaminate the environment

97
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
and incur unneeded expenses
