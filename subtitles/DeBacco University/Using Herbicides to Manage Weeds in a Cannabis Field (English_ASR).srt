1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,599
as the name implies herbicides are used

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,560
to manage weeds

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,080
so utilizing them in a large field or

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,558
even a small scale

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
is an option we want to be mindful and

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,678
cautious

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,599
of how to best utilize them if it's an

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,359
option that we are considering

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,879
here on debaco university we're going to

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,960
provide you with some information about

11
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:30,320
using herbicides to manage weeds

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:31,840
in a cannabis field

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
with any method of weed control you

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,119
should research it fully so here if

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,238
you're considering herbicides

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,558
we're going to get into some of the

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,959
specifics here and relate it to

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,718
cannabis so first off you always want to

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,759
check with your current state laws

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,399
and your regulations make sure

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,679
what you're looking at is also current

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,359
for the growing year

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,719
because just as it was current last year

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,960
doesn't mean it's going to be current

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,239
this year so you want to be mindful of

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,439
that you're following the current

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,839
laws and regulations i provided a link

28
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,000
here

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,558
uh the connecticut has provided some

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,239
guidance relating to assortment of

31
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,679
pesticides for hemp and medical

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,438
marijuana production

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
so this can be used as a guide if you're

34
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,158
not from connecticut to kind of

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,438
get an idea of what some options may be

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
or what some of the rules

37
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,158
laws and regulations may look like now

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,640
often this is a limited

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
list when in regards to cannabis common

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,359
active ingredients

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
incur occur a few listed here

42
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,040
maybe some name brands that you might be

43
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,679
familiar with i know avenger

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
very commonly used for because it is

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
omri certified

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,478
for most weeds grasses and broad leaves

47
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,199
you can use 20

48
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,799
vinegar citric acid corn gluten there

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,719
are a lot of options

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
but it might be a limited list compared

51
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,560
to what some other chemicals

52
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,478
that might be implemented or utilized in

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
other production methods

54
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,799
now herbicides caution is just in

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,039
general so this is just in general

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
know what weed or weed species are the

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
main target

58
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,959
to say i want herbicide to kill

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
everything maybe you're trying to target

60
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,879
a particular

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,438
weed species watch for potential drift

62
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,318
the finer the droplets made the further

63
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,280
they will travel

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,359
in wind events physically a physical

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
spray barrier is great when row applying

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,360
especially if there's crops present

67
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,959
keep in mind also of any signage you may

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
have to be posting

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,039
as well as the wind and timing of your

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
application

71
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,159
be sure you have different nozzles if

72
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,520
you're looking especially at a large

73
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,520
scale make sure your pressure is

74
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,719
regulated these are all just general

75
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,680
things when spraying anything

76
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,199
but in particular with herbicides so

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,599
we're looking at herbicides

78
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,639
we're looking also at when is it quote

79
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,000
rain fast

80
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,839
and when we say rain fast that means

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,039
stuck to the actual leaf this is

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
important particularly for outdoor

83
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,679
production

84
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,239
they might have dew coming in or rain

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,159
events typically a hot and dry morning

86
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,360
is the best application time when the

87
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,959
plant will be kind of

88
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
the weeds plant will be starting to grow

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
a little bit more aggressively and that

90
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,039
may make your herbicide application more

91
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,878
effective

92
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,120
and also the rainfast time allowed to

93
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,679
adhere to the leaf bind to the leaf

94
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
and reduce the chance of it running off

95
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,959
for some common

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,719
products here you can see a whole list

97
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
in the hours until rain passed some

98
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,359
taking six to eight hours

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
some rain fast and basically one or

100
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,879
potentially less than one

101
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
so again just a little comparison here

102
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,759
if you know the particular product

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
you're using how many hours until it's

104
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,840
rained fast here not that you want to

105
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
play the line

106
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
but just good information to be aware of

107
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
so in regards to canvas production

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
even if you're going to consider using

109
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,039
herbicides and they are permitted

110
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
you want to limit spraying to early part

111
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,039
of plant development particularly the

112
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,598
veg

113
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,598
side of the growing cycle you want to

114
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,679
avoid late season applications as this

115
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,679
could easily cause it to enter

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,719
the plant and show up in potential

117
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,319
quality tests

118
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,318
causing your end product to potentially

119
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,919
fail inspection so again

120
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,598
if you are using herbicides even if they

121
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,199
are improved approved

122
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,280
favor applying them early in the season

123
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,839
to reduce the chance of your end product

124
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,438
failing any sort of inspection

125
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,878
uh last one we're looking at herbicides

126
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,079
where would we utilize them well they're

127
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,158
commonly used to prevent

128
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
weeds from growing up fences they're

129
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,679
also economies to prevent

130
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
a shortening of electrical fences so in

131
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
this example or this case this might be

132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
far from your actual plants

133
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,798
and this is why it's important to be

134
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,238
considered of potential for drift

135
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,920
so even if you're not applying them next

136
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
to or in row

137
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,199
this is another very common application

138
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,519
where they're made

139
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,919
just be mindful of drift and potential

140
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,160
barriers or distances you need to be

141
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,159
particularly with growing cannabis
