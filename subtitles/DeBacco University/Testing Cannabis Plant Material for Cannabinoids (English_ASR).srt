1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
so in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,439
going to go into

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,960
testing chemist plant material for the

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,320
all-important cannabinoids

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
looking at some of the analytical

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,599
procedures that are done and the

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,920
importance of doing this

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,920
on plant cannabis plant material

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,439
[Music]

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,599
all right let's look at testing chemist

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
plant material for cannabinoids

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
well first off here's the research

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,760
article where a lot of the information

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
is pulled from so you're welcome to look

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,480
at this

16
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,920
in more detail if this is of great

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,078
interest to you

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,359
so one reason why growers would test for

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,759
cannabinoids

20
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,439
well growers want to know how potent

21
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,878
their plant material is because the

22
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,679
composition of certain chemical

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,159
compounds

24
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,119
can largely impact the value expected

25
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,359
price paid

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,038
for their produced end product this is

27
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,878
how you can start to see some

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
different values here different amounts

29
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,679
different costs because it can relate to

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,759
the potential

31
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,439
of the concentration of cannabinoids and

32
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,960
also potentially the terpene profile

33
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,198
present

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,879
so why is testing for grammars important

35
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,959
just in general you know we talked

36
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,920
there's other testing that goes on keep

37
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,158
in mind you don't want to forget about

38
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
microbial testing and mycotoxin testing

39
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,280
heavy metal testing as well but why is

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
cannabinoids important

41
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,478
well there's increasing evidence that

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,519
the ratios of cbd relative to other

43
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,239
cannabinoids

44
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,759
as well as endo androidiz chemicals such

45
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,239
as terpenes and flavonoids

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
exhibit desirable entourage effect so

47
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,759
this is important as far as looking at

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
the potential

49
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,159
benefits to this plant material the

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
synergistic interactions between

51
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,520
cannabinoids and other chemicals

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
may be responsible for the medical

53
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,920
benefits in the actual individual

54
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
this is why in part it's important to

55
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,040
test for these not just to claim the

56
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,719
highest or

57
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,118
particular numbers so canvas testing and

58
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,280
the

59
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,959
pharmaceutical testing practices is kind

60
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
of like merger between the two

61
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,519
so here we've talked about all the

62
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
importance here we see a simplified

63
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,280
version

64
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
now we're looking at kind of what an

65
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
analytical analytical report can look

66
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,759
like

67
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,118
and cannabis has cannabinoid percentages

68
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,879
that are relatively high

69
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,560
compared to other pharmaceutical

70
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,679
compounds that may use

71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,280
bio analytical trace analysis

72
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
since it's common to dilute cannabis or

73
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,479
hemp plants extracts by a hundred or a

74
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,959
thousand fold or more

75
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,079
to reduce the concentration of targeted

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,080
cannabinoids

77
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
the to the levels appropriate for the

78
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
analytical quantitative

79
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,359
determination so that means chemists

80
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
relatively speaking

81
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,560
to other pharmaceutical products has

82
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,159
relatively concentrated requiring it to

83
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,840
be diluted down

84
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,680
to be able to perform with some of the

85
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,360
improper analytical tests

86
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
these analytical procedures need to be

87
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
amended for from current protocols to

88
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,119
maximize the information

89
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
content that is obtained to ensure the

90
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
information you're getting as a consumer

91
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,439
is accurate and representative of the

92
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,199
actual plant material

93
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,598
now current popular technique when

94
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,359
determining potency is hplc

95
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,959
high pressure liquid chromatography

96
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,959
using a photodiode

97
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
array detector is commonly used in the

98
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,680
cannabis industry because it's

99
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,318
relatively easy

100
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
and inexpensive to employ and the

101
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,079
different peaks will represent in

102
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,439
different

103
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
compounds and there's different columns

104
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,878
that can be used column sizes mobile

105
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,280
phase buffer solution

106
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,158
a lot of information goes into those

107
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,158
proper analytical techniques

108
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:20,079
now the sim lcms technique which is the

109
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,919
selective ion monitoring

110
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,319
liquid chromatography mass spec

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,000
technique can reduce the potential for

112
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,039
unknown interferences

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,439
due to co-illusion which can cause

114
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,318
go unnoticed with the hplc techniques

115
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,919
that are used

116
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,000
this is simply providing a little bit

117
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,798
more of a precision

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,479
way of analyzing those particular

119
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,799
compounds

120
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,399
now this liquid chromatography uv

121
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
chromatography compared to this

122
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
different analysis we can see a little

123
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,639
comparison here and this is some of the

124
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,438
data presented in that research article

125
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,878
this analysis of the sample shows much

126
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,560
improved selectivity

127
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,959
and absence of interfering

128
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,039
chromatography components

129
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
this is that when we go back here that

130
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,000
selective ion monitoring

131
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
liquid chromatography analysis this is

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,759
due to the increased

133
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,519
selectivity techniques where only the

134
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,399
protonated molecules of the targeted

135
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,719
cannabinoids

136
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,599
are monitored so we're getting a higher

137
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,238
degree of

138
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,358
specificity here we're seeing this

139
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,198
standard method

140
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,399
right here and then here we're seeing

141
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,520
the

142
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,239
selective ion method employed here and

143
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,240
this is the

144
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,439
analysis of the same extract in

145
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,240
comparison

146
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,519
where in a the protonate molecules of

147
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,319
the targeted cannabinoids cbda and cbd

148
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,719
along with thc and thca were monitored

149
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,478
we see a greater degree of precision

150
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,080
hopefully a little bit more accurate

151
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:44,879
results to get rid of some of what's

152
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,680
called the data

153
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,240
noise that could be employed and lastly

154
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,400
just looking at hplc compared to the two

155
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,720
here again important to kind of like

156
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,159
research and kind of have an idea of

157
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,919
the testing methods available and what

158
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
the lab that you're getting tested

159
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,120
from results from might be utilizing and

160
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,000
in contrast to the hplc method

161
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,840
if either the lc or the lc-ms which is

162
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,680
liquid chromatography mass spec analysis

163
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,239
of the same sample as performed

164
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
the considerably higher selectivity of

165
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,680
either of these techniques

166
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
could facilitate qualitative

167
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
identification of unknown compounds as

168
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,038
well as

169
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
mitigate the potential for unexpected

170
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,879
chemical interferences

171
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,639
for the quantitative determination of

172
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,478
the targeted compound

173
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,319
great summary basically it's more

174
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,800
precise at looking at

175
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,319
very specific compounds which can be

176
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,240
very beneficial

177
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,519
when we're dealing with a plant material

178
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
that can have a whole host

179
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,560
of potential other chemicals or

180
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,719
background noise there we want to be

181
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,199
very selective in a sense ensure we're

182
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
getting a

183
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,360
quality result a targeted result and a

184
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
very selective

185
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
result so while this might seem a little

186
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,560
complicated studying you know all the

187
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
analytical equipment

188
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
it's just part of you being an informed

189
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
consumer

190
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
for typical products that you may look

191
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,279
at purchasing or as a grower are looking

192
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,560
at getting submitted to a lab

193
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,559
for analysis
