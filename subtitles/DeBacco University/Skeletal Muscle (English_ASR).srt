1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,410
looking at the title it should come as

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,929
no surprise that this is gonna pertain

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,730
to scale to muscle getting it to a

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,888
little bit more detail of the skeletal

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,559
muscle and exactly what's going on here

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,359
being able to recognize the microscopic

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,698
view here you keep in mind this is

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,710
involuntary controlled so we do have

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,630
control over where it goes and what we

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,580
do with it

11
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:25,890
so skeletal muscle overview each muscle

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,768
has a discrete organ composed of muscle

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,528
tissue blood vessels nerve fibers and

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:34,140
connective tissue again there's a bigger

15
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,030
image of the microscopic look it does

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,039
have neurons connecting it because we

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,379
need a way for our brain to tell that

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,420
muscle to contract because it is

19
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:46,079
voluntary controlled that's is why we

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,390
have the motor neuron so the three

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,210
connected tissue sheets are the endow

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,878
museum the parrot museum in the EPI

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,859
museum that is connected sheaths just

24
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,899
like our knife here the sharp blade of

25
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:01,198
the knife is stored in the sheath that's

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,019
a protective outer layer here that same

27
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,179
concept applies here so our museums our

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,260
skeletal muscle fibers the black circle

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,180
the endow museum is the red circle here

30
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,880
Paramecium is the green and the outer

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,700
thick area here is called the EPI museum

32
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,719
so that endomysium it see that pictured

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,450
here in this model Paramecium is the

34
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,810
area this she's protective layer here in

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,650
the EPI vision located right here so

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,019
looking at these a little bit more

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,450
detail that in the museum is the fine

38
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,670
sheath of connective tissue composed a

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,670
particular fiber surrounding each muscle

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,879
fiber keep in mind endo means in that is

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,740
the innermost portion here paradism are

42
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,989
fibrous connective tissues that surround

43
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,328
groups of muscle fibers called the

44
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,728
fascicles see that right here

45
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,578
there's our param and this is one zoomed

46
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:56,459
in area here this is the fascicle

47
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,408
located right here and in the overcoat

48
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,658
here the dense regular connective tissue

49
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,729
that surrounds the entire muscle is the

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,540
EPI in its iam think of it as like

51
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:09,449
epidermis is the outer most covering a

52
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,830
little bit more detail FF as iam allows

53
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,299
the muscle to contract and move

54
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,810
powerfully while maintaining its

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,650
structural integrity

56
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,870
this is the epic messy in here this epic

57
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,000
museum also separates muscle fiber from

58
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,310
other tissues allowing the muscle to

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,680
move independently so keep in mind these

60
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,239
muscles need to move and contract need

61
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,909
to be separate from what's surrounding

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,219
them within the body the epimysium helps

63
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,870
provide that barrier during a little

64
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,789
deeper here a Paramecium allows the

65
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,459
nervous system to trigger a specific

66
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:41,590
movement of a muscle that's the allowing

67
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,019
that connection of that and neuron to

68
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,509
come in in the innermost the endomysium

69
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,819
here connect contains the extracellular

70
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:51,068
fluid and nutrients to support the

71
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:53,079
muscle fiber as we'll learn it for these

72
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:55,988
muscles to contract a lot needs to go on

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,480
and this endomysium is providing that

74
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,670
fluid in nutrients to help allow our

75
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,159
muscle fibers to contract these

76
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:05,048
nutrients are supplied ultimately from

77
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,789
the blood to the muscle tissue and

78
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:11,469
that's when nutrients are brought in and

79
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:14,199
waste are brought out lastly here our

80
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:16,060
muscle fiber produced by the fusion of

81
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,849
several cells that their ends discretes

82
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,430
a very long muscle fiber that contains

83
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:24,430
all the original nuclei so keep in mind

84
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,549
that we're having this linking of a

85
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:30,180
bunch of these cells together this

86
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:33,189
multinucleated fiber essentially these

87
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,599
microfilaments are bunched together to

88
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:37,030
create myofilaments and that's what

89
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,909
we're noticing here skeletal muscle as a

90
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,039
reminder found involuntary muscles and

91
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:44,109
they produce powerful voluntary

92
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,060
contractions this would be something at

93
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:48,700
work having control over and moving and

94
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,409
able to have control over which we will

95
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:55,138
notice will be different compared to the

96
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:55,139
other two different types of muscles
