1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
okay in plants and animals cells go

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,660
through the process of division and it

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,580
can be through mitosis or meiosis

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,710
depending on what end product they're

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,559
producing mitosis they're gonna produce

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,109
two identical copies of the original

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:19,589
cell meiosis is going to produce gametes

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,720
such as pollen or egg now cell division

9
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,489
results in increasing the total number

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,649
of cells and I said there's two

11
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,598
different end products the gamete or sex

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,339
cell production is through meiosis in

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,589
identical copies would be through

14
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,750
mitosis

15
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:35,308
now meiosis produces four total cells

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,530
that are genetically different with the

17
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,000
goal to produce new offspring these are

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,520
cells that are producing either pollen

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
or egg cells there's actually two phases

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,219
of division and that's how you go about

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,619
getting the four total cells in the end

22
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:51,359
what's happening is the chromosomes are

23
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,280
spreading out and being pulled to

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,159
different poles and then the centromeres

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,039
are breaking causing different copies to

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,929
be resulting in the end products to

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,510
increase genetic variability of the

28
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,540
offspring to increase ideally the odds

29
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:08,759
of survival now mitosis is a little

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,490
different mitosis is cell division

31
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,799
resulting in two identical cells from

32
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,500
the original there's a result of typical

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,890
plant growth by by and large mitosis

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,090
occurs much more frequently as the cells

35
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,009
multiplies it's inheriting the same

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,170
chromosome and genetic material as the

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,069
original cell if it doesn't that's what

38
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,329
we call a mutation that would occur

39
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:33,179
ideally there's no different engine from

40
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,969
the original and that mutation typically

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,650
ends poorly for the cell so there's

42
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,289
steps and measures in place to allow

43
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,600
cells to divide but allow them divide in

44
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,520
a way that helps ensure they have the

45
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,640
same genetic material as the original

46
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,560
cell meristematic tissue is found it to

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,170
shoot tip this is the growing tip here

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,180
and also at just behind the root caps

49
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,909
this is a root microscopic view of the

50
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,700
root these meristems are a site of high

51
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,409
might hydrate of mitosis you can think

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,240
about that logically the apical the very

53
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,530
top meristem is a site of growth because

54
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,289
that's what the plants can be growing

55
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,110
upward and the root area is also going

56
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,150
to be a high rate of cell division

57
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,890
because that's gonna serve as that root

58
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,420
growing through the soil

59
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,759
to increase the plant's ability to

60
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,879
observe water and nutrients the root cap

61
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,079
here is a protective structure that

62
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,789
pushes through the soil so it comes to

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,010
contact with rocks or some other debris

64
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:29,429
it's not damaging this very sensitive

65
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:31,979
and important area of mitosis cell

66
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,480
elongation occurs so this is looking at

67
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,329
the room to talk about the air people

68
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,310
call meristem a plant growth is not as a

69
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,380
result of cell division here elongation

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,209
here the roots growing by those same

71
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,400
cells same number of cells simply

72
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,979
stretching on this allows the plant to

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,930
grow in size as root cells in long gates

74
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,539
the pressure pushes the root through the

75
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,520
soil and in the apical meristem as we're

76
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:57,569
getting more cells than the elongate in

77
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,010
this area now cell differentiation this

78
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,689
allows cells to take on a very specific

79
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,479
function depending where they're located

80
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:05,310
in the plant so just as you originate

81
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,289
from one cell and cells in different

82
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,449
areas took on parts of the circulatory

83
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,609
system or nervous system the same thing

84
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,289
happens in plants the imple cells and

85
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,340
leaves may take on the function of

86
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:19,229
producing food cells in the stems may

87
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,969
take on vascular tissue and cells in the

88
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:23,939
roots may take on the very important

89
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:26,219
task of water and nutrient absorption it

90
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,439
all this occurs this differential occurs

91
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:32,479
after division this allows our cells to

92
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,479
become specialized to perform a function
