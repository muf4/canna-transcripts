00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,720
if you're going to be looking at the cut

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,759
and stick method you need to choose what

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,400
substrate

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
you're going to stick your clone into in

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
here we're going to cover some of the

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
most common options

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,920
to help you make an educated decision

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,358
[Music]

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,879
all right let's get into substrate

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
options for the cut and stick method of

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,559
cannabis cloning

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,919
so first off options to use that i'll be

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,839
covering in this video

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,440
rockwell oasis and foam all kind of fall

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
into a similar category

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,558
sand as well as soilless media will be

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,039
covered

19
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,599
here so you can choose the best option

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,159
that fits

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
your growing situation so first off

22
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,238
let's talk about

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,440
oasis and this is a foam that's inert

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,759
and designed to provide

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,920
a soilless growing medium for plant

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,878
roots that's capable of supplying water

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,840
in a steady basis without affecting ph

28
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,839
or the growing

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
environment so those are all great

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
attributes or positive attributes to

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,320
oasis

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,158
may look like rockwell cubes but they

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,759
are made from a different material and

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,640
i'll talk about rockwell in the next

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,478
slide

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,040
there's also capillary action which is

37
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,959
kind of like like a sponge effect

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
through the foam that ensures a constant

39
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,399
supply of water the plant roots or seeds

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
if you're germinating seeds

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640
that is advantageous for the propagation

42
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,399
of cannabis seeds

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,040
the lower density foam keeps the top of

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,200
the cubes sheet drier which reduces

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,118
algae growth and increases root zone

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
aeration i'm going to say reduces algae

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,759
growth if you over saturate it we can

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
see in the picture here

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,040
you still can get some algae growth but

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,799
definitely a reduced

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
level if you're keeping the moisture the

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,960
proper amount

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,239
so that rockwell that i had mentioned

54
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,399
sometimes referred to as

55
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,959
stonewool it's manufactured so it can be

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
made to fit specific applications

57
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,239
the material is inert and holds water

58
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,759
while still providing aeration to the

59
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,478
roots great benefits

60
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,519
also growers near complete control over

61
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,679
the dial in

62
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,280
feeding program which can help maximize

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
plant growth in production

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
for that grower that can feed the plant

65
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,640
exactly what it needs in the exact

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,038
quantities

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
they would talk about sand here briefly

68
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,719
it's uh it's possible but not really the

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,319
best option because it can have some

70
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,759
inconsistent moisture levels in the root

71
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,199
zone it can have little dry pockets or

72
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,719
some nice little wet pockets

73
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,399
it's also very heavy material if you're

74
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,359
looking at transporting or having on a

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,039
grow bench

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
it can also but it can be easily

77
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,560
acquired by growers and typically place

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
sand would be used

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
clean sterile not a lot of weeds other

80
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
advantages of using sand

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
then we get to lastly here soilless

82
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
media here

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,318
has similar general properties to soil

84
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
but is much more favorable for container

85
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:40,399
growing

86
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,919
it also does have some buffering

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
capacity unlike some of the ones that i

88
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,878
mentioned before

89
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,159
many different blends and manufacturers

90
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,439
to fit a wide variety of growing

91
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,719
situations i don't think there's just

92
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,878
one soilless media

93
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,878
and growers can buy once and be done

94
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
there's no need to mix or blend

95
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,239
or kind of do anything else on their own

96
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,639
they can open the bag

97
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,158
and immediately start using it so if

98
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,119
you're choosing the cut and stick method

99
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,039
hopefully this

100
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
provides you with some information on

101
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,318
selecting the best substrate

102
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,318
for it to fit your conditions
