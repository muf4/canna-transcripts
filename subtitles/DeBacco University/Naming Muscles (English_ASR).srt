1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,139
okay here we're going to look at naming

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,759
and identifying some muscles and I

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,989
thought this was a very appropriate

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,730
image to put as the title slide so going

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,309
on in naming of skeletal muscles will do

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,199
some important factors that go into the

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,719
naming process is not just our random

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,429
name the location of the muscle the bone

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,368
or body region associate with that

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,109
muscle can affect the name the shape of

11
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,460
the muscle can be part of the reason

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,010
where it gets its name

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,109
for example the deltoid muscle deltoid

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,380
means triangles it's a triangular shaped

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,870
muscle the relative size whether it's

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,450
maximus being large minimus being small

17
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,128
or long as being long direction of the

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,190
fibers rectus or fibers that run

19
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:46,679
straight transverse and oblique fibers

20
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,988
that run in angles the number of origins

21
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,509
biceps has two origins triceps have

22
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,738
three origins location of attachments

23
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,619
it's named according to the point of

24
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,929
origin or insertion and also the action

25
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,429
of flexor or extender as they named the

26
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,609
muscles that flex are extend

27
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,469
respectively in addition to how these

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,689
muscles get their name well a lot of

29
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,298
it's derived from the Latin so we could

30
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:12,029
look at our Latin roots and be able to

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,618
derive the meaning muscle that moves

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,469
things away so this is what I want to

33
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,618
highlight an abductor moves muscles away

34
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,118
so if you remember from the other

35
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:23,849
lectures that I did or we talked about

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,938
angles and movement abductor moves

37
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,399
things away in contrast that adaptor is

38
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:32,069
a muscle that moves towards typically

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,540
towards the midline and these are just

40
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,449
some examples here that you're welcome

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,909
to look at and comparing these two that

42
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,520
may sound initially very similar how

43
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,618
they differ and how they're Latin Brut

44
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,890
can help describe the motion that they

45
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:49,228
did not the overview of muscles I tried

46
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,368
to highlight some in green that I'm

47
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:52,259
going to have you responsible for

48
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:55,379
doesn't mean the others are any less

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,149
important just trying to provide with a

50
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:00,170
little direction as far as what to

51
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,879
expect potentially and one of my quizzes

52
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:07,200
we have our deltoids here remember

53
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,810
that's a triangle-shaped triceps we're

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,560
three points of origin who is maximus

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,840
big muscles just able to

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,598
go through and identify some of these

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,569
key muscles here adductors how did those

58
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:24,598
move you can see all the other ones that

59
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,259
for right now I'm leaving out as far as

60
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,339
knowing for identification quiz

61
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,719
sphincter is one I do want you to be

62
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,879
able to recognize it's a little hard to

63
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,650
show it's an internal muscle it's

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,719
actually a ring of muscles surrounding

65
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,120
and serving the to guard or closing

66
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,280
opening of a tube such as the openings

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,159
on the stomach this is our lower

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,318
esophageal sphincter and this is what's

69
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,930
sealing opposites close version is as

70
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,179
it's opened version here it's open as we

71
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,739
want food to pass into the stomach but

72
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,080
it's closed we don't want the stomach

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,700
acid to get into our esophagus if you've

74
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,219
suffered from heartburn you may having

75
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,829
improperly closing esophageal sphincter

76
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,109
that's could lead acid to getting into

77
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,469
the esophagus creating that burning

78
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,260
sensation muscles that create facial

79
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,699
expression this occipital front Alice

80
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,169
there's a one right in the front here

81
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,810
you can see how it kind of relates to

82
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,369
some of the names of the bones so again

83
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,370
excuse many more that create facial

84
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,379
expressions is hiding that one here keep

85
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,810
in mind the terms anterior and lateral

86
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,509
don't go away and that helps us be able

87
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,840
to determine the view of the angle that

88
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,399
we're getting on these images muscles of

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,469
the eye now I didn't highlight any of

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,840
these particular but I want you to be it

91
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:40,409
or realize again lateral versus medial

92
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,079
what's that superior going up inferior

93
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:45,568
going down medial going towards the

94
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,930
middle region this is the right eye in

95
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:52,649
the anterior view versus the right the

96
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:55,290
right I hear what the lateral view so

97
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,650
remember anterior or lateral superior

98
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:01,849
medial inferior all terms that you still

99
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,900
need to be reviewing and familiar with

100
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,209
prostrate lateral views of the neck

101
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,889
there's our trapezius this same muscle

102
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:12,299
if you want to be able to recognize it

103
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:14,100
in two different orientations some of

104
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,889
our external obliques were looking down

105
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,600
at the muscles of the abdomen region try

106
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,549
to focus on a few this one does kind of

107
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,500
zoom in a little bit but please realize

108
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,029
the external obliques are here they're

109
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,360
also here instance a zoomed in version

110
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:30,899
and our pectoralis major major being our

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,879
large muscles muscles that position the

112
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:36,299
pectoral girdle so we're looking at

113
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:39,658
again that our scapula here and we have

114
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,598
our sternum we have our part of our

115
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:44,459
scapula here and some of the muscles

116
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:46,560
that attach to that I did go over

117
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,718
already deltoids and trapezius but again

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,209
those come back and here you're able to

119
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:53,848
appreciate the orientation that they are

120
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,799
in the body now if it says cut this is

121
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:57,870
the Delta that's been cut in this region

122
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,150
to expose some of the other attachment

123
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,139
points in bones please realize that that

124
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:05,638
Delta it does cover this entire region

125
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,680
upper arm muscles our biceps and our

126
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,710
triceps biceps having two points of

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,269
origin triceps having three be able to

128
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,938
recognize where each of these are

129
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:17,310
located fuming main our anterior view is

130
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:21,180
here on the left and our prosti riyer

131
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,918
here your right let's say our hip and

132
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,829
thigh muscles again that gonna make you

133
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:29,668
learn a lot of these but the quadricycle

134
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:32,068
it is maxis and the adductor group all

135
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:34,758
should be familiar as far as what they

136
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,598
do in the relative size comparison

137
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,370
hopefully it's helpful to give you a

138
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:39,990
brief overview of some of the muscles

139
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,120
you should be able to identify an

140
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,889
appreciation for all the muscles that we

141
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,788
do have in our bodies and all the

142
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,788
corresponding names
