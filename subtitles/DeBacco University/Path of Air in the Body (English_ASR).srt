1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
okay here we looking the path of air in

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:09,179
the body now this serves a nice overview

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,010
of the nose the larynx trachea the right

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,349
lung and left lung we're gonna look at

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,000
this in a little bit more detail and be

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,719
able to identify some of these portions

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,809
on how air moves to our body so the

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,118
first part with respiratory system zones

9
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,339
first one is the conducting zone this

10
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,920
provides rigid conduits for air to reach

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,349
sites of gas exchange so what we're

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,719
looking at is bida nose the nasal cavity

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,450
the pharynx and the trachea up in this

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,160
region these rigid zones stay open all

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,760
the time and they're what's allowing air

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,828
to both enter and also exit in addition

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,349
to the conducting zone we have the

18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,660
respiratory zone this is the actual site

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,460
of gas exchange this occurs in the

20
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:55,799
bronchioles the alveoli ducts in the

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,420
areas down kind of within the lung that

22
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,299
we typically think of as where gas

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,469
exchange is specifically occurring

24
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,299
lastly we have a respiratory muscles

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,129
such as the diaphragm which is located

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,009
down here and other muscles that help

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,930
promote ventilation so our zones are the

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,810
areas where we're having that actually

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,090
either gas exchange or areas of gases to

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,579
move through and the respiratory muscles

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,420
are what's helping move that air both in

32
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,408
and out our respiratory zones continuing

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,359
on looking a little bit more

34
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,759
specifically at the path of air air

35
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,799
normally enters through the nostrils

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,069
passes to the larynx is here which is

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,180
our voice box and then to the trachea

38
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,459
and then it goes to the bronchioles of

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,159
the lungs the tracheal tube is formed by

40
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,349
stack sheesh C shaped pieces of hyaline

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,750
cartilage what that means is they're not

42
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,059
solid rings but they're actually C

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,040
shaped so you have a bunch of these C

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,850
shaped rings kind of all piled on top of

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,649
one another

46
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,819
allowing some areas of kind of

47
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,560
compression years you could think of it

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,469
kind of like being able to move but that

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,129
C shape is able to hold it open to allow

50
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:01,078
air to exchange continuing on the lungs

51
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,539
hang free and the thoracic cavity and

52
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,328
air tubes called Broncos connects each

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,310
lung to the trachea

54
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:11,699
continuing on the lungs contain millions

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,409
of these al alveoli many many many of

56
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,009
these because this is the actual site of

57
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,560
gas 6

58
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,539
between the air and our blood this

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,739
thoracic cavity is bound to the bottom

60
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,900
of the thick layer of muscle called the

61
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,000
diaphragm so the diaphragm is located

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,099
down here and that will move and help us

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,989
be able to allow air to come into the

64
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:32,969
lungs and also exit these alveoli are

65
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,819
tiny sacs in the lungs you can see them

66
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,519
here allowing co2 and oxygen to be

67
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,229
exchanged this allows for a rapid gas

68
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,969
exchange due to the extremely high

69
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,429
surface area to volume ratio that they

70
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,469
have they're also missing this image

71
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,439
does a great job showing this

72
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:52,799
surrounding a network of capillaries so

73
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,500
we want these blood vessels to be very

74
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,480
thin this allows the red blood cells to

75
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,449
travel one by one allowing for the

76
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:04,078
maximum rate of gas exchange we want our

77
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:05,459
co2 to diffuse out we want our oxygen to

78
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,159
diffuse in and that's what we see going

79
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,650
on both here and also here and that kind

80
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,108
of intense Network is very evident in

81
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,658
both of these images give you that

82
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,849
overview of the respiration here we can

83
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,348
look and there's tiny Airways again

84
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:21,179
we're branching from a large area to

85
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:25,378
smaller to a smaller these tiny little

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,939
air pockets and we have our alveoli here

87
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,918
which is our tensed network of

88
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,289
capillaries and it's allowing for the

89
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,590
actual gas exchange to occur this is

90
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:37,439
what's helping our cells diffuse out the

91
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,049
carbon dioxide and diffuse in the oxygen

92
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,549
as a reminder keep in mind that none of

93
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,519
this is occurring by active transport

94
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,439
it's all simply by diffusion by simply

95
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,689
having a greater concentration of oxygen

96
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,519
here and a lower concentration of oxygen

97
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,889
and the blood in this case oxygen will

98
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,079
naturally diffuse in and carbon dioxide

99
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,969
as a result will diffuse out this is

100
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,980
that general overview of the respiratory

101
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,979
system related to our gas exchange
