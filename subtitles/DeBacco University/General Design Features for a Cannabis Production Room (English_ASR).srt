00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
all right welcome to this debaco

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,278
university video we'll be covering

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,349
general design features for cannabis

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:14,400
production room

5
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:16,000
[Music]

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,839
let's get into some of the design

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
features regarding a cannabis production

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,559
room

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
so generally environment factors to

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,239
consider just remember that a large room

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,199
does not need anything different than a

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,038
small room

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,599
but some environmental aspects can be

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,920
harder to achieve as the grow space gets

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
larger basic items to consider which

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
will be covered here

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
are lights temperature water air

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,039
circulation

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,878
plant density as well as ceiling height

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
so let's get into some of the specifics

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,159
here starting with

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,920
lights so you want to know what your

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,679
electrical circuit can handle

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
and this may determine the total plants

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,679
you can grow or what you need to upgrade

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
to what kind of level you need to

27
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,878
upgrade to

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
now the type and wattage of lights you

29
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,039
plan on using will impact the total

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,358
coverage

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,879
area per light in addition you want to

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,039
take into consideration other factors

33
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,878
such as hvac systems fans

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,478
and other things that may need power but

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,840
lights tends to require the most

36
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,319
wattage so definitely something to

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
consider there in addition to our lights

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,000
we also have the temperature to regulate

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
so

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,359
heating and or cooling at larger space

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
can be a challenge

42
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,319
remember the regulation of temperature

43
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,599
needs to take into consideration all

44
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,758
plant supporting equipment

45
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,118
they just talked about here the lights

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,200
we could also be looking at

47
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,239
fans and anything else that you might

48
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,359
have running

49
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,560
in the production area grow space

50
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,560
then there is water so will you be using

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
stored water or using it directly out of

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,118
a source

53
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,719
if you're using stored water can the

54
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,000
floor support the weight of a water tank

55
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,359
you plan on using

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
remember one gallon of water weighs

57
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,399
about 8.33 pounds

58
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,680
so a 250 gallon water tank will weigh 2

59
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,840
082 and a half

60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
pounds does your water source supply the

61
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,719
volume and pressure you need

62
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,879
and to answer that question you need to

63
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,640
know what chosen irrigation system or

64
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,000
fertilization system you're using

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,239
to make sure that is the case also the

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,399
very important air circulation so as a

67
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,199
single room increases in square feet

68
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,959
moving air can be a continual challenge

69
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
fans on the walls are common solution

70
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,719
but more air movement may be

71
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
necessary so this could mean overhead

72
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,919
fans and our fans

73
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
within the grow space might be needed so

74
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,919
you can see here there's some on the

75
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,839
walls

76
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,199
but there's also some down here on the

77
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,039
floor

78
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,479
we also get to plant talking about plant

79
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,239
density so

80
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,519
total plants per square foot is

81
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,159
partially dependent on the pruning

82
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,840
methane

83
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,479
but in general a full-size plant you

84
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,959
want to plan for having one plant per

85
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,799
five square feet or two plants for every

86
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,920
square meter just to give you a general

87
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
idea

88
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,759
of how many your plant density should be

89
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,759
and lastly ceiling height so it's

90
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,359
important factor to consider the height

91
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,318
of the ceiling can impact the amount of

92
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
air circulation

93
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,958
and spacing of plants and lights higher

94
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,759
ceilings offer more flexibility for the

95
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
growing space

96
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,120
but also make it more costly to enrich

97
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,439
with carbon dioxide

98
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
so again taking into considering these

99
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,199
pros and cons

100
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
with your grow space and definitely have

101
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,280
a plan

102
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,519
for each of these particular

103
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,519
environmental factors mentioned here
