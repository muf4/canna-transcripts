1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay here we are look at active forms of

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,778
hydroponic systems the basics of those

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,309
often timely require a pump or in some

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,379
way to move water that might be

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,089
considered unnatural yeah now this is a

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,370
a bad thing that's something that we

7
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,779
need to do to make that water move where

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,419
we want it to so it's efficiently

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,100
delivered to our plants now there's many

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,020
more options with active hydroponic

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,359
systems compared to those passive

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,118
systems whose passive systems rely on

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,679
capillary action in a wick here we have

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,719
an increased amount of options to move

15
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,789
these nutrient solutions due to the

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,759
diverse amount of water pumps that are

17
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:38,369
available that will be scaled in size to

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,000
fit particular operations to maximize

19
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,738
efficiency there are recirculation pumps

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,128
in these are systems in place that will

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:49,468
reduce nutrient solution and reduce loss

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,869
so it's kind of that recirculation that

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,340
kind of recycling of that water however

24
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,619
if the system is not clean and it

25
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,260
includes all parts of the system disease

26
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,509
can spread very fast so for example if

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,009
this one container became infected or

28
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:04,379
recirculating that water amongst all

29
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,938
these containers they could all transmit

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,130
that disease and all become infected

31
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,459
because the entire area here of

32
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,868
production to have a plant disease then

33
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,489
there are one-way systems and these

34
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,290
often lead to increased cost use the

35
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:19,109
waste generated we're kind of pumping

36
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,030
the water one way and that's it it's

37
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,359
going to also cause an area soil or

38
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,859
water contamination keep in mind this is

39
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,228
a lot of times with overhead systems

40
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,118
many hydroponic systems will reuse some

41
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:33,799
form of recirculation and this is why

42
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,799
cleanliness is so important
