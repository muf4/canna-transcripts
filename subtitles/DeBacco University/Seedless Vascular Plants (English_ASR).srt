1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
hey as we go along we're getting a

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,539
little bit more complex through our

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,570
plant evolution and we're at the point

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,730
of seedless vascular plants you may be

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,009
familiar with the most common example

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,649
here are ferns all to the category of

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,089
seedless vascular plants I want to use a

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,519
term vascular though you might be

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,920
wondering what what does this refer to

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,679
well vascular tissues are specialized

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,539
cylindrical or elongated cells that form

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,070
a network throughout the plant think of

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,410
it like the vessels going through the

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,140
plant there's two types of this vascular

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,969
tissue first type is called xylem and

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,530
this conducts water and minerals from

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,808
their roots or port to the rest of the

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,689
plant xylem works mainly in one

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:44,070
direction starting at the roots going up

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,439
to what we call the chutes and then

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,829
ultimately the leaves water will then

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,149
exit out the leaves through the stomata

23
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,370
the other vascular tissue is called

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,039
phloem this conducts carbohydrates

25
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:58,558
throughout the plant now phloem can work

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,239
both going from roots to chutes but it

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,549
can also go from shoots down to roots

28
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,429
phloem is ability to move up and down

29
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,810
the plant reason why that's important is

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,330
carbohydrates need to be moved

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,490
throughout the entire plant they grow in

32
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,650
a potato below ground that storage organ

33
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,109
the carbohydrates made in the leading to

34
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,040
be moved down to the potato here we have

35
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,009
an actively growing

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,868
apical meristem the growing tip we need

37
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,909
to move coverage from this leaf up to

38
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,250
the plant to here so phloem is ability

39
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,189
to go up and down this transporting

40
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,200
mainly sugars to describe a hydrates

41
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:33,298
xylem is conducting water in some

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,939
minerals is mainly working from the

43
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,740
roots upward in one direction to the top

44
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:42,508
of the plant now are believed to be the

45
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,569
oldest remaining group of the vascular

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,750
plants as meant to have been around 400

47
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,849
million years these if you've ever been

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,688
walking in the woods you see these

49
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:57,539
examples of a crown pine which are a

50
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,529
kind of a subset of club mosses and we

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,329
think they're going to get any taller

52
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,868
altered they're not this is their

53
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,669
typical fully grown size there's some

54
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,978
other types of club mosses you can see

55
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,288
they look very different and we're

56
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,209
progressing along our Colada gram here

57
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,829
we're working our way getting to

58
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,509
gymnosperms and angiosperms

59
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,910
what we see we've progressed from our

60
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,709
losses our hunger to our liver works and

61
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,129
this are all originated from our common

62
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,750
ancestor of green algae

63
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:26,370
now these seedless vascular plants ferns

64
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,349
as I said is the most common one you're

65
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,539
probably familiar with this sporophyte

66
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,759
generation is much larger and more

67
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,659
complex than the gametophyte when we

68
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,969
commute if I it's going to produce

69
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,759
gametes sporophyte is going to produce

70
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,659
the spores leaves on a sporophyte are

71
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,219
called fronds

72
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,379
so this gets into lists a little

73
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,909
terminology here and we're looking at

74
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,729
the seal is vascular plants in

75
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:50,030
particular ferns this entire isn't

76
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,799
called a leaf this is called a frond

77
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,800
this phylum also includes wisk ferns and

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,300
horsetails also fall into this category

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,910
the blade is the area here as we see we

80
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,950
have the frond being the entire portion

81
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,829
and the blade being where we would

82
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,449
typically say where the leaves are but

83
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,000
each one of these there are little

84
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,699
leaflets so this is kind of all one

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,389
continuous unit here and that is

86
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,829
referred to again as the frond for ferns

87
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,869
now the alternation of generations

88
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,160
I mentioned a little bit before as I

89
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,019
said you're most familiar with the large

90
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,509
sporophyte this is what it looks like

91
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,969
the haploid generation that's producing

92
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,489
the gametes here the comida fie it looks

93
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,050
very different and those spores are

94
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,390
coming together as sore on the other

95
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,130
side of the lead of the frontier that

96
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,958
are falling to the ground they're

97
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,430
producing the gametophyte so produces

98
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,000
both male and female committed fights

99
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,980
and to fertilize to develop the diploid

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,750
organism here it will then produce the

101
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:53,488
sporophyte lastly of the fern lifecycle

102
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,219
there's a rhizome which is a modified

103
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,080
underground stem the sources I mentioned

104
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,729
here is a collection of spore producing

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,280
sporangia and they're the little dots on

106
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:05,639
the underside of the lead if you've ever

107
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,409
looked at a frond of a fern that leaf

108
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,419
you may see some little dots under it

109
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,099
that's the sporangium and that's going

110
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,629
to produce the spores that ultimately

111
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,659
boost the comida fights that produced

112
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:17,759
the next generation in New England early

113
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,439
in the springtime may see something

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,048
called fiddleheads

115
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:26,089
these are young curled fronds in some

116
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,839
are edible they don't last for very long

117
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:31,349
early in the spring

118
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,329
typically once of April in May you may

119
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,250
see these kind of curled up things

120
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:41,668
starting to grow those are small little

121
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,870
curled up fronds of a fern and some

122
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:45,779
people really like them and there's

123
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,399
certain varieties that are edible and

124
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:53,719
you may see them as illicit as

125
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,719
restaurants as fresh plants if you can't
