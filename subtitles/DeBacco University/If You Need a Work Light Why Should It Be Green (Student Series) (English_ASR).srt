00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
on this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,119
video we're going to answer if you need

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
a work light why should it be green

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,679
and it will bring in some research from

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,200
dr bugbee on this particular light that

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,199
gets a lot of attention in growing

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,199
operations

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,679
[Music]

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,559
all right well let's start off with that

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,198
quote from dr bruce bugbee he goes on to

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,079
say quote do not go out here running

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,640
around saying dr bugbee says that green

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,640
light is not safe at all our eyes are so

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
sensitive to green we can see plants

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,719
with 1 100th the amount of green light

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,878
as we can with blue or red it is still

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,960
if you got to have a light it is still

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
the best color of light and quote i'll

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
put the link to the youtube video there

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
so keep in mind this is really not from

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,238
the plant standpoint reason why greens

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,480
being recommended because our eyes are

23
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,718
very perceptive to that and we can see

24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,159
plants with a very small amount of light

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,320
so if you need to use a light even

26
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,000
though not advised this would be the

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,079
color of light to use so let's get into

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
the video now so we're using our fence

29
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,599
lights just by turning them on and off

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
with our timer to grow our clones but a

31
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,839
lot of people opt to using green lights

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,880
for when their lights are turned off or

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,880
set to nighttime this is because green's

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,199
wavelength for

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,759
its light is a lot dimmer than many of

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,920
the other colors so this allows us as a

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,359
grower to be able to observe our plan

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,118
all right so we just saw that green

39
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,200
light there and again why we're choosing

40
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,560
green was the least efficiently used

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,719
color of light in the visual spectrum uh

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,118
chlorophyll absorbs now keep in mind

43
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,478
that this light is a low par light and

44
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,359
it's recommended for a work light and

45
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,478
used only when needed if you are in the

46
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,478
flowering cycle or photo period avoid

47
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,478
continuous hours of darkness

48
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,879
interruptions especially during this

49
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,319
particular period and if you are using

50
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,039
this light you want to keep it very

51
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,839
minimal and use it only when needed for

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
the shortest duration of time there it

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,359
can still throw off your photo period

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,079
but again if you need something to see

55
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,840
something this would be definitely the

56
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,118
wavelength of light that would be chosen

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,959
to be best

58
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,719
now is this concept of green light being

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
reflected green light is reflected but

60
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,719
something is reflected externally but

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,959
some is also reflected internally

62
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,439
externally reflected is what plants

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,039
appear green because leaves reflect more

64
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,959
green light than other visible

65
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,280
wavelengths but typically this is only

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,878
about five to ten percent of green light

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
is actually reflected

68
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,199
uh this wonderful kind of leaf

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,360
penetration kind of side view if you

70
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,759
will us is produced by utah state

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,239
university dr bugbee's lab

72
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,399
internally reflected also occurs this is

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
why green light penetrates deepest into

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
the leaf surface because it's not

75
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,199
efficiently absorbed by chlorophyll it

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,800
was really officially absorbed by

77
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,039
chlorophyll it'd be all kind of absorbed

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
at the very top because it's not what

79
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,560
ends up happening is it kind of like

80
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,799
bounces around on the leaf there and

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,318
that's why it gets in to be penetrated

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,760
deeper now this doesn't mean that

83
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,158
chlorophyll is the only absorbing

84
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,359
pigment there's many others so keep in

85
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,759
mind there is some reflective that's

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
what gives leaves their green coloration

87
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,479
but it's not as high as most people

88
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,560
think as far as number or volume of

89
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,238
green light some is penetrating some is

90
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,479
bouncing around there still being

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
utilized so again as a work light if you

92
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,399
have the option green to be the

93
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,399
preferred option but really hopefully

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,959
doing all of your work during the normal

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,959
lights on period
