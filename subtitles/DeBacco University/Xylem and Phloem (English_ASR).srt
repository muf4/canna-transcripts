1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,200
alright I'm gonna go over a brief

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,439
overview of xylem and phloem remember

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,480
these are part of vascular plants xylem

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,420
is mainly transporting water and

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,000
minerals from the roots to the shoots up

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,399
the plant and phloem while showing it

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,960
moving down they can move throughout the

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,299
plant that could be down it could be up

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,760
into the side because it's transporting

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,118
carbohydrates in this case sucrose from

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,368
source areas of the cell to sink areas

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,808
where that sugar needs to be stored so

13
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,640
while there's two kinds of a scar tissue

14
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,919
we're going to focus first on xylem

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,539
remember floral mean the other enzymes

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,309
conducting water and minerals from the

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,259
roots to the shoots there's two

18
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,049
conducting elements the tranq heads and

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,878
the vessel members and at a microscopic

20
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,519
view this is how they would look our

21
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,589
phloem and xylem now zaimes transporting

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,120
that water in those minerals through

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,940
these vessel elements and drynke adds

24
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,858
both of these are dead at maturity and

25
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,729
have primary and secondary cell walls

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,879
remove are in a plant here the pits and

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,349
the pits here the secondary wall is thin

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,569
or missing allowing water to flow

29
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,798
laterally so maybe you can see that a

30
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,478
little bit better here where we're

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,820
getting some lateral movement of water

32
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,728
now again this is still occurring from

33
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,199
the roots all the way up to the chute

34
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:21,629
and how it looks at a microscope while

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,299
me may not be stained the same color all

36
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,879
the time the xylem is this larger region

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,030
some people consider these animal clinic

38
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,368
straws it's may be a way to help you

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,469
remember it even though there are these

40
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,390
kind of perforated plates that are

41
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,548
occurring so it's not 100% true does

42
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,200
that say it is it like a straw but it

43
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,720
does certainly look like them on a

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,659
microscopic view in contrast to the much

45
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,438
smaller phloem that involved with active

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,020
transport

47
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,839
so mentioning phloem let's look at that

48
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,199
a little more detail so phloem is

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,390
nutrient conducting tissue it's in close

50
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,299
relation to companion cells there's two

51
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,290
conducting cells there's these sieve

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,630
tubes members in these seed cells you

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,479
can see an image of that here phloem

54
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,679
transport sugars and other items in

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,420
angiosperms which are flowering plants

56
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,680
the safe tube elements contain sugar

57
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,389
solution

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
see two cells are surrounded areas

59
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,218
supportive of cells so when I say close

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,408
relation to companion cells these

61
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:24,959
companion cells can be either adding

62
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:28,459
sugar or carbohydrates to the phloem or

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,359
taking it out of the phloem

64
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,859
translocation in the phloem phloem is

65
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,510
composed of cells and receive two

66
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:36,359
elements phloem SAP as it may be

67
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:38,638
referred to travels who perforations

68
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,170
called sieve two plates neighboring

69
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,329
companion cells carry out metabolic

70
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,059
functions for the seep two elements and

71
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,069
provide them with energy these lateral

72
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,329
sieve areas

73
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:50,548
connect to decieve to the elements to

74
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:52,560
the companion cells so what does all

75
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:56,159
this kind of summarizing mean will these

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,069
companion cells are helping add or take

77
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:01,259
away sugars again moving sugar is -

78
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:03,869
requires energy requires active

79
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,789
transport so these companion cells in

80
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,980
these cases are the ones responsible of

81
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:11,429
kind of this loading or unloading of the

82
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:13,979
phloem sap kind of this direct

83
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,169
comparison for xylem and phloem we see

84
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,268
xylem all the arrows going from in this

85
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,680
case the shoots to from the I should say

86
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,310
from the roots all the way up to the

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,650
shoots that one direction from the roots

88
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,139
working its way up through the plant to

89
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,849
the shoots now phloem we see the arrows

90
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,530
going up arrows going down to two-way

91
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:34,318
flow there's water and food being

92
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,539
exchanged here there's companion cells

93
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,280
there's food storage cells again this is

94
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,878
moving our carbohydrates or sugars

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,098
throughout the cell the cells here so

96
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,500
the plant can take energy captured

97
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,899
through the process of Phocis synthesis

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,729
and leaves and can bring them to storage

99
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:57,030
organs another good comparison here is

100
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:59,129
our xylem again shoots are up the top

101
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,568
here and our roots are down here and

102
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:02,969
that water is moving from those roots to

103
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:04,668
those shoots going to the shoes Sloan

104
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:06,810
can go in both directions here

105
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,669
translocation to the sink the sink is

106
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,158
the area that's taking on metal sugars

107
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,079
needing those sugars sucrose is actually

108
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,000
transferred from the source cells and

109
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,918
decieve to it to the elements this

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,019
causes water to enter the phloem from

111
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,959
the xylem as we see here resulting

112
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,908
positive pressure forces the sucrose

113
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,699
water mixture down towards the roots

114
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,689
where sucrose is unloaded here the root

115
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,659
is an example

116
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,250
we are 6l transpiration causes wanted to

117
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,280
return to the leaves through these

118
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,500
island vessels so what is this process

119
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,359
of transpiration that I mentioned well

120
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,230
it's a simple movement of water through

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,199
the plant cohesion theory and SAP accent

122
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,509
shown here evaporation from the cells in

123
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,930
the leaves produces negative pressure

124
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:53,219
and kind of that pulling force and that

125
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,920
gradients causes water to move upward

126
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,360
from the roots to through the xylem so

127
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,879
here's our roots here's our water

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,480
molecules entering the roots here going

129
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,279
up through our trunk of the tree and

130
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,860
exiting out the stomata which is in the

131
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,089
leaves the top of the plant here now of

132
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,069
course what is coming in here and

133
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,659
leaving out here also that this kind of

134
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:16,529
shows you the long way that water can

135
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,420
take and our root cells compared to our

136
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:20,909
atmosphere the atmosphere is more

137
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,590
negative indicating water's moving from

138
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,570
the roots where it's high water

139
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,819
potential to this area of low water

140
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,939
potential gradient in being essentially

141
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,319
pulled out of the leaves there hopefully

142
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,649
this is helpful in explaining some of

143
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,819
the important functions xylem and phloem

144
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,819
perform in vascular plants
