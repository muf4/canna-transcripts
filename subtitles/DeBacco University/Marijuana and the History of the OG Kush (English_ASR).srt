1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
all right in this tobacco university

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,798
video we're going to be investigating

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,719
marijuana and the history

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,759
of the og kush a very famous variety

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,960
you might have heard of before so while

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,280
marijuana is high

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,880
in thc content that is important to know

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,439
and while this channel does focus

9
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,198
more on the hemp it's important to

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,198
understand that while marijuana

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
is associated with that recreational use

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,400
in general following and understanding

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,480
the history of the famous og

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,719
kush strain can provide great insight

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,359
into the marijuana culture in general

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,079
and a lot of the information is spread

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,759
through oral

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,840
history and kind of explanations of

19
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,280
things so this just kind of serves as an

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,120
example of that

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,039
also the og kush has become a worldwide

22
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,718
staple used for numerous famous trains

23
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,960
like girl scout cookies and there's

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,079
also many different phenotypes of the og

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
kush

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,239
that exist the following that i'm going

27
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,679
to present here is the history of the og

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,159
kush is based on an

29
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,000
interview with matt bubba berger who

30
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,679
found a bag of seed in florida that

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,238
would later become known as the og

32
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,280
kush the original interview came on the

33
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,599
adam dunn show

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,560
as you can see right over here adam dunn

35
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,879
right there and i was

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
been very fortunate to meet him both in

37
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,478
denver

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
colorado and also on the east coast if

39
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,679
you want to

40
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,478
hear the interview for yourself i have a

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,320
link to the

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:22,478
youtube uh description there as far as

43
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,079
how to look it up and the link to

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,359
provide if you want to look at the

45
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,079
original interview but here i'm going to

46
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,319
provide a

47
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,798
kind of summarized version so the

48
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,519
history of the og kush just in general

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
looking at its original this originated

50
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,158
in

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,200
orlando florida and the seed came from

52
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
an unknown bag of wheat in miami in

53
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,600
1991.

54
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,078
we just was called crippy which was

55
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,078
really just a generic term for good weed

56
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,118
and it's the start of the generation

57
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,759
that started naming

58
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,519
and breeding around this time frame only

59
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,040
one plant was kept and propagated from

60
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,679
the limited amount of seeds that were

61
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,240
present

62
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
in the once original weed and it was

63
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,199
just called kush

64
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,280
since the first batch was said to look

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,478
like cushberries that's an important

66
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,759
note to make that

67
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,239
there's really no such thing as a

68
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,080
cushberry but they like the name

69
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,359
so it stuck and it became a popular

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
popular in the cannabis

71
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,879
industry in 1996 it's made its way to

72
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,318
los angeles so while a lot of people

73
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,280
think the og kush is a

74
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,280
west coast california-based strain the

75
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,000
original seed did come from orlando

76
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,640
florida in 1991.

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
now become how would become the og kush

78
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,000
here

79
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
well in 1988 star to actually be called

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,959
the og

81
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
kush in an attempt to identify it as the

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
original strain grown in

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
los angeles ground in la there in

84
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,759
general it tends to be a

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,560
viny morphology and can have homogenic

86
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,439
tendencies as well originally to prevent

87
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
the strain from being

88
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,680
lost seeds were the main form of

89
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,039
distribution and this is how the og kush

90
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,000
got spread across

91
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,000
the united states now looking at the og

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
kush it's a quality over

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,280
quantity example here so the cush is

94
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,719
generally a poor yielder in quantity

95
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,479
it's not going to give you like an

96
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,919
example of the tomatoes over here it's

97
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,639
not going to be a ton of tomatoes but

98
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,079
it's going to give you

99
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,559
high quality um end results there

100
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
so the quality was above average in

101
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
shops in amsterdam

102
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,719
i did not want to pay any more for

103
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,480
originally since it was not well known

104
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,639
it's hard to get a premium price even

105
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,759
though the quality was higher in

106
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,878
amsterdam

107
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,120
however during 1997 to 1999

108
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,639
in los angeles california it was getting

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
top dollar for the cush

110
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,919
due to the great demand and limited

111
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
supply

112
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,639
to give you an idea of what the price is

113
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,200
going for around that time frame you're

114
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,759
looking at 500 plus dollars per ounce

115
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,719
and it was sold even before it was grown

116
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,759
that's his

117
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,318
shows you how high in demand it was now

118
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,239
cush is very much a west coast strain

119
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,000
sour diesel was dominant on the east

120
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
coast so these kind of develop the

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
west coast as more og kush east coast

122
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,560
more that sour

123
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,560
diesel strain now limited starting

124
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
materials mentioned so the kush strain

125
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
can be traced back to an original

126
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,239
literally few seeds that were found in

127
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,519
an

128
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,280
ounce of weed way back in the early 90s

129
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
very rare for this limited starting

130
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,680
material to become such

131
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,119
a successful strain but remember it is

132
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,920
possible if you think about developing

133
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,840
your own

134
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,599
there are some people who have feminized

135
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,159
it and generated their own versions of

136
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
it

137
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,919
but original uh has been kept for these

138
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,879
special unique terpene profile that it

139
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,439
does um

140
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,000
possess here to find that true and

141
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,439
original

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,800
og kush now past the present and i gave

143
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,800
you that kind of like just quick summary

144
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,199
matt bubba berger has been growing the

145
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
same plant propagated via clones for

146
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
about 18 years

147
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
up to this up to the publication of this

148
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,280
video overall the end product

149
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,800
is unchanged but the leaf morphal

150
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
morphology has gone from more of the

151
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,319
traditional kind of

152
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,039
five-fingered leaves to more funky

153
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,599
random

154
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
morphology over that many years of

155
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
propagation

156
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,759
yield has dropped a little bit but over

157
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,918
this time

158
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
however the chemical profiles remain

159
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,799
like the original

160
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
so that's the importance of kind of

161
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,478
clones or maintaining a strain over a

162
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
long period of time

163
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,639
at the point of he interviewed here he

164
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,399
was growing up for 18 continuous years

165
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
and like i said it's a slight difference

166
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,519
in plant morphology but the key part is

167
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
that chemical

168
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,959
and terpene profile remain the same

169
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
giving that og

170
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,198
kush the reason for why it's still

171
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,879
