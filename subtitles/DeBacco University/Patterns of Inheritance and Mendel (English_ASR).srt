1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,229
okay here I'll get patterns of

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,389
inheritance in Mendell this is an

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,620
example of a family tree or pedigree and

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:09,300
we'll be looking at these a little bit

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,580
further this is kind of like a basic

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,839
introduction to heredity there's going

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,079
to be our unit that we're going to go

8
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,179
over so starting with a family tree or

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,939
pedigree that you may not initially

10
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,948
think of but I grow giant pumpkins and

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,560
we could see here this is a family tree

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,019
or pedigree of one of the giant pumpkins

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,759
that I grew back in 2013 for

14
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,409
nomenclature purposes it's the weight

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,809
and yes that's one thousand seven

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,460
hundred sixty six and a half pounds the

17
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,159
last thing with the grower in the year

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,609
was grown and that's what precedes all

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,919
of the lineage here so you could see my

20
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:46,079
pumpkin here was grown from this seed

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,090
and you see the weight in the last name

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,039
of the grower in the year and that seed

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,620
came from these pumpkins so on and so

24
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,198
forth now with pumpkins you need to

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,058
plant a seed in the ground and you need

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,399
a pollinator so you developed a column

27
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,679
from somewhere so this is the lineage of

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,448
the cross that I made with the

29
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,019
pollinating plant it seized went my

30
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:07,618
previous grown pumpkins here now in

31
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,829
nature

32
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,049
pumpkins apples things that require bees

33
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,118
bees could fly to any flower and go

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,700
through and cross pollinate how we know

35
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,310
this lineage is as giant pumpkin growers

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,540
we're isolating the flowers so what does

37
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,519
that look like there's a little umph in

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,950
version of another see that I ground

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,109
with a picture here we're putting in

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,109
some way in this case a cup over the

41
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:33,509
flower to isolate the cross meaning no

42
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:37,228
random bees came in I would specifically

43
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,659
take a flower a male flower from a

44
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:42,299
pollinator and directly pollinate the

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,520
female flower here so that's how we're

46
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,740
able to develop this lineage in this

47
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,899
family tree through controlled and

48
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,239
isolated crosses as giant pumpkin

49
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,739
growers so there's my toes giant

50
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,140
pumpkins gives a little bit of a visual

51
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,938
here here's a resulting pumpkin and

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,640
here's the seed that that pumpkin came

53
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,078
from and here's the pollinator and you

54
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,689
could see with pumpkins you kind of get

55
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,519
a blending sometimes here this pumpkin

56
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,618
took on the shape of its mother a little

57
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,109
bit more and the color from the

58
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,389
pollinator or its father so you kind of

59
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,870
get this mixture of shape from one maybe

60
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:16,208
color look for another

61
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,129
it's kind of an in-between pumpkin from

62
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,689
these two since we're talking about

63
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,329
gregor mendel it's a good thing he

64
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:25,120
didn't do pumpkins he was looking at pea

65
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,170
plants and a good thing the reason why

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,599
it's a good thing is looking at peace

67
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:30,759
and not pumpkins is peace and not to

68
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:32,799
show these blended traits they show a

69
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,419
clear dominant recessive trait there's

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,860
no out of affect there's no grading

71
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,719
sliding scale

72
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,880
it's either it expresses it or it

73
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:42,879
doesn't it produces purple flowers or

74
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,159
white flowers not pink or light purple

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,469
or kind of off-color it's one or the

76
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,150
other and mandela's patterns of

77
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:50,620
inheritance the tendency for traits to

78
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,659
be passed from parent to offspring is

79
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,390
called heredity that's the main topic

80
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:56,818
here he was an Austrian monk who was the

81
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:59,889
first person that really studied this

82
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:02,649
and is considered to be the father of

83
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:05,798
modern genetics he worked with garden

84
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,360
peas in his monastery and it's like I

85
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,939
said it's a good thing he worked on pea

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,110
plants and it was from he lived from

87
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:15,789
1822 to 1884 so he chose garden peas for

88
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,500
several reasons from his standpoint one

89
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:20,439
there's many distinctive varieties were

90
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,079
available they're small and easy to grow

91
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,699
and grow a lot in a small area short

92
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,379
generation time and lots of offspring

93
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,238
the very important we do scientific test

94
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:30,879
you want to occur quickly you know to

95
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,650
have a lot of sample size both male and

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,900
female reproductive organs are enclosed

97
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,849
in the same pea flower it also helps for

98
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,640
pollination then they able to go through

99
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,409
and make these general crosses made

100
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,599
distinctive varieties being available in

101
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:46,000
this case this could be tall plants or

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,189
short plants could be green pods or

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,659
yellow pods white flowers or violet

104
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:52,090
flowers so that was very important

105
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:54,009
unlike a tomato if you're both a tomato

106
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,379
catalogers extensive an extensive

107
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:58,509
amounts of varieties it'd be hard to

108
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,750
tell them apart here pretty distinctive

109
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,289
varieties is it fair Muslim designs what

110
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,750
did it look like

111
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:05,858
well it's looked at seven

112
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,349
characteristics to study you need to had

113
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,209
two distinguishable traits Gila each

114
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,769
right self-fertilize meaning pollinate

115
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,500
with itself take the pollen from the

116
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,030
same flower and pollinate itself with it

117
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,639
and it's developed it's called a true

118
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:21,159
breeding what true breeding means is

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,500
that you take to the parents here if

120
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,659
they're true breeding you can cross them

121
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,829
together you get the same offspring you

122
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,789
cross those together at the same

123
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:30,159
offspring

124
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,530
just consistency's it breeds true from

125
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,900
type in this case you have two purple

126
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,399
flowers always producing purple flowers

127
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:40,479
that's what's called a true breeding

128
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,250
variety or purebred true breeding line

129
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,800
it communicated right here and these

130
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,110
things called

131
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,819
non true breeding where the offspring

132
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,189
may produce initially what looks like

133
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,709
the same but then they see in the f2

134
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:56,800
generation I'll do myself over here in

135
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:59,019
the f2 generation right down right down

136
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,420
here you're seeing that there's a white

137
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:06,490
flower and that white flower is because

138
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:08,920
it's heterozygous so up here we have two

139
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:13,509
heterozygous right we have a white and a

140
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,430
purple over here now we have two purple

141
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,980
flowers and they are both homozygous

142
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,959
dominant meaning they are going to be

143
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:23,620
true breeding and we could see

144
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:25,209
throughout the whole lifecycle over here

145
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,840
that they're all true breeding they're

146
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:30,189
all purple however if you look at Part B

147
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,849
now we're getting into some differences

148
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:35,469
here are f1 generation looks the same

149
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,960
phenotypic ly is the same Geno typically

150
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,360
is different and rf2 generation is where

151
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,359
we're noticing we have purple and also

152
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,280
white flowers being produced so that f1

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,129
is that first generation in f2 says

154
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:52,299
second generation and this is a result

155
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:53,800
of their being a heterozygous genotype

156
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,900
here even though the phenotype is the

157
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,699
same

158
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,379
so it's experimental design over the

159
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,149
rental design across two individuals

160
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:04,779
from two different varieties that differ

161
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:06,729
in only one trait he had a purple and a

162
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,559
white bread them together got all

163
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,879
purples in the f2 generation again

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,240
produced 75% purple and 25% white we saw

165
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:19,180
that in our previous crosses there what

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,220
he observed we observe how the seven

167
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,509
pairs of contrasting traits studied he's

168
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,750
called this thing called dominant

169
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:27,879
recessive traits so certain things would

170
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,800
mask or hide other traits in this would

171
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,659
the dominant traits and the recessive

172
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,720
traits would simply not be expressed

173
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,880
unless you had two alleles two genes of

174
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,169
that same recessive type now I don't

175
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,969
want you to think of recessive being

176
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:40,870
negative because recessive traits aren't

177
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,110
necessary

178
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,480
the bad it just means they are not shown

179
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,180
only if they're hetero if they're

180
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,180
homozygous recessive the dominant trait

181
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,970
in a heterozygous will mask or hide that

182
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,069
recessive trait as we see here with our

183
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,070
green odds and our yellow pods in this

184
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:02,680
case if yellows dominant the genes for

185
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,939
green are there but all of the pods will

186
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,660
be yellow because that's the dominant

187
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:10,389
trait another example we'll use earth is

188
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,470
called punnett squares seeing two little

189
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,899
bees two big bees you're seeing

190
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,700
heterozygous Alda brown eyes here we

191
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:17,229
take into two individuals from these

192
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:20,379
resulting offspring we feed those

193
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:24,870
together and we see that we get 75%

194
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:27,069
brown eyes 25% blue eyes that

195
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,990
three-to-one ratio is the dominant

196
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,980
recessive is what we see here that just

197
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,439
repeated again

198
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,810
since our Polo's we are male and spear

199
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,389
can stole from our female and we're

200
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,870
noticing the resulting genotype and also

201
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,829
phenotype we need to keep those in mind

202
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,629
so put that in perspective here our

203
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:47,409
genotype and phenotype the genotype

204
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,300
there's 25% homozygous dominant Big B

205
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,950
baby

206
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:57,069
50% heterozygous Big B little B and 25%

207
00:07:52,949 --> 00:08:00,519
homozygous homozygous recessive and that

208
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:03,279
it used to be white it's a 1 to 2 to 1

209
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:07,569
ratio for a genotype however our

210
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:10,029
phenotype is different 75% purple 25% or

211
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,649
white that's just looking at them fino

212
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:16,539
typically with it what they basically

213
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:18,909
Express this is a result of Mandela's

214
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,290
experiment he looked at many many many

215
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,350
individuals again a good thing that they

216
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,510
were a short generation time and you

217
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,790
could see here and I'm excessive he did

218
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:30,339
the ratios out over a large sample size

219
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,310
and he pretty much got very close to

220
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:35,799
that predicted three-to-one ratio so

221
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:37,719
this has helped to prove the results

222
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,240
that he was observing there and this is

223
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,850
how our punnett squares are able to take

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,120
this and try to present it in a clean

225
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:48,940
ratio form even it may not be 100% exact

226
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,600
it can be very close observed even in

227
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,600
large numbers
