1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
here I'm going to provide just a brief

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,769
overview of four different types of

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,780
speciation this is kind of the quick

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:13,259
general overview good way to kind of go

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:16,799
back and review hello Patrick Perry

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:20,519
Patrick parapatric and sympatric

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,500
speciation so we have the quick easy

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,899
definitions here and will provide you

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,518
with some visuals to help allow you to

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,049
understand these a little bit better

11
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,778
which will help you describe certain

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,239
situations so so it's the first one

13
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,219
allopatric speciation this is a result

14
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,649
of a geographic isolation or a

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,230
geographic barrier that results in

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,629
complete reproductive isolation and

17
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:47,819
creates no gene flow so we have this

18
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:49,468
very predominant physical structure it

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,659
could be a geographical isolation to be

20
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,910
a mountain range for example causing

21
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,979
reproductive isolation causing different

22
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,779
species in this case because of no gene

23
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,058
flow crossing between these we have the

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,770
green and blue species developing

25
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,170
completely separate from one another

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,228
with no gene flow interacting between

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,210
those two then we have the parapatric

28
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:11,129
speciation this is a geographic

29
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,309
isolation results in reproductive

30
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,890
isolation of only peripheral populations

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,500
which does result in isolated gene flow

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,509
so here we have a subset of this

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,420
population that then kind of separated

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,478
out and we see that's developing its own

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,930
with isolated gene flow to the original

36
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,950
population this geographic isolation

37
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,710
occurs only for these kind of peripheral

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,750
populations it's kind of broke off and

39
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:40,500
here we see development the blue and the

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,109
green species moving on we have a

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,239
parapatric speciation which is a result

42
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,938
of geographic isolation resulting in

43
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,699
partial reproductive isolation which

44
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,819
results in limited gene flow so we see

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,930
the original population streaming are

46
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,269
crossed kind of combination with the

47
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,820
ingredient almost developing we see a

48
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,560
favoritism here for the blue jeans and

49
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,109
here for the green and we had this

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,750
limited gene flows to result in our two

51
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:10,409
different species here the blue and the

52
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,930
green lastly here we have sympatric

53
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,620
speciation which is junik overlap

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,469
results

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,670
and no reproductive isolation which does

56
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,229
result in gene flow

57
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:20,669
so we have our original population we

58
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,639
have our population within a population

59
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:27,030
as a result gene flow is easily able to

60
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,409
happen with no reproductive isolation so

61
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,659
we can get the development of these

62
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,669
species but this population originated

63
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,769
within the original and there is gene

64
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:36,449
flow because there is overlap that is

65
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:38,549
occurring between these two different

66
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,399
species well that gives you just a quick

67
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:43,890
general rundown of speciation and allow

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,519
you to explain what may occur in certain

69
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,518
situations
