1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,400
what's becoming very popular in the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,359
cannabis industry and for good reason

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,559
is called integrated pest management so

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,718
as a result

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,678
the cannabis industry is seeking

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,678
integrated pest

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,199
managers to help mitigate pests while

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,519
minimizing impacts

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,879
on the plant and final products produced

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,000
so if you're interested in learning more

11
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,479
about this job

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,480
continue watching this debaco university

13
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,119
video

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,600
all right let's get into learning about

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,640
a cannabis integrated pest

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,840
manager so first off their general job

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,799
description now it may be a little

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,399
varied may depend on the size of the

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,640
institution you're working at but

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,960
integrated pest management or ipm

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,160
spray technician is one example they

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,160
provide daily care

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
for the crops in keeping them healthy

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,119
looking for potential infestations as

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
well as disease

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,519
and correcting them as needed they are

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,079
responsible for a kind of quality

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
assurance

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,239
specialist as they perform inspections

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,158
and testing of products as well

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,719
and they make the final improvement of

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,479
approval for shipments

33
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,200
involved in this we're looking at that

34
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,359
ipm that pest management communication

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,439
trying to mitigate or reduce the chance

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
of any negative impacts on the crop

37
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,679
while also mitigating any sort of

38
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,159
negative effects on the long term

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
end products being produced for example

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
spraying pesticides might be a great way

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
to control an insect

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,799
but it's going to leave a potential

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,719
residue maybe looking at

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
utilizing cultural practices or

45
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,519
beneficial insects

46
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,438
might be a great way to get the same

47
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,078
level of control for an insect

48
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,599
without re while still reducing the

49
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,359
chance of any sort of

50
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,118
contaminants being passed on to the

51
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,438
final end product

52
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,200
so what are their day-to-day activities

53
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,719
well their spray technician is they

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
inspect all plants and rooms that

55
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,319
inspection is very important scouting

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,799
and attention to detail

57
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,478
is very important and if they do find

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
any infestations they need to

59
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,399
assess those infestations and the degree

60
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,399
of severity

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,799
also maintaining records to know when

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,199
the station came in what room it was in

63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
is important for documentation you're

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,958
also involved in taking plant samples

65
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,359
as well as samples of potential disease

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,000
or insects and they complete

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,400
spray assignments when necessary and

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,639
they also maintain the proper equipment

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,319
they assist in data entry and track and

70
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,759
trace which is a very important process

71
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,679
of the documentation

72
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,679
involved with cannabis now when you're

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
looking at kind of getting into like oh

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,879
have an insect have a disease go and

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
grab a chemical and spray that's the

76
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,759
very last part

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,920
mainly because we have the toxicity

78
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,598
level being the greatest so cultural

79
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,759
practices using good sanitation and

80
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,159
habits change and analyzing those

81
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,239
is a great initial step physical or

82
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,878
mechanical ways to kind of eliminate a

83
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,719
problem

84
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,799
then looking at biological means and

85
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,159
then chemical is kind of the last resort

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
and kind of the conventional method is

87
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,359
the absolute last result

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
why because it may take care of the

89
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,599
problem but it may have other

90
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,400
negative side effects to the final crop

91
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,359
or production

92
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,039
process so what's the qualities a person

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
must have if they're looking at pursuing

94
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,239
this as a potential career

95
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,238
well bachelor's degree in biological

96
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,239
sciences or agricultural sciences

97
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,200
is usually required basic knowledge of

98
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,840
plant pathology and pest identification

99
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,119
knowledge of associated safety

100
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,959
precautions field experience is usually

101
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,920
advised because there's a lot of

102
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,479
outdoor grows and insects outside a

103
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,079
computer

104
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,158
literacy to be able to kind of integrate

105
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
everything ability to conduct repetitive

106
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,399
tasks and lift 50 pounds for a lot of

107
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,759
movement of products and plants relevant

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
professional licenses if you're looking

109
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,318
at our spraying something

110
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,000
must be at least 21 years old or older

111
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,158
and must successfully pass a

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,919
comprehensive background check to work

113
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,280
at a cannabis facility

114
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,518
now the specific connections to a

115
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,039
cannabis facility is an ipm technician

116
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
and quality assurance specialist ensure

117
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,280
that the medicinal

118
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,878
product being processed follows all

119
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
proper testing requirements and

120
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,438
regulations

121
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
for the state that they're working in

122
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,799
and keep in mind different states will

123
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,239
have different rules

124
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,560
without these vigorous testers the

125
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
quality of the cannabis available today

126
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,158
would be unregulated unhealthy and

127
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,039
possibly dangerous to the cannabis

128
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,280
consumers

129
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,479
if proper health standards were not met

130
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
and it's this

131
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,000
manager that's coming in and making sure

132
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,759
that any products that they're applying

133
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,279
to get the end result that they want

134
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,519
are going to have the least amount of

135
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,799
potential impacts on the actual final

136
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,319
cannabis end product

137
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,400
and that could be the dry flour like the

138
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,599
end product going through and then going

139
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,758
through the extraction

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
process so very important good

141
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,560
communication skills to work with others

142
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,399
involved

143
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
but this is gaining popularity and for

144
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,519
good reason to produce a still a quality

145
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
end product

146
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,039
with minimum chance of failures for

147
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,039
pesticides or microbial

148
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,040
analysis
