1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
okay here we're gonna look at the plant

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,990
hormone called oxen this is what it

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,149
looks like on the chemical structure I

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,888
call it the ball and stick model here

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,009
but we're learn about how it influences

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,629
and impacts plants so starting first

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,730
oxen can move through the plant from the

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,189
site of initial production move to the

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,899
process of active transport now it can

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,089
diffuse this is a hormone that can

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,278
diffuse through plant cells but only

12
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,089
diffuses at a rate of about a centimeter

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,460
per hour

14
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,099
however when oxen is transported through

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,500
active transport it's much faster about

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,909
10 times as fast I mean they can move 10

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,369
centimeters per hour and this is

18
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:41,669
advantageous to the plant we see that

19
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,259
here we see our oxen moving down here

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,629
through the process of active transport

21
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,878
you know moving those proteins embedded

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,000
in the cell wall through the cell

23
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,710
membrane here and it's using ATP so it

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,840
is an energy investment for the plant

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,120
but this is advantageous because it's

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,730
able to get that oxen throughout its

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,288
system much faster it's kind of the

28
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,148
tortoise in the hare example here

29
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,859
diffusion would be the tortoise and

30
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,960
active transport would be the hare in

31
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,069
this case

32
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,978
so what's oxygen do well it's got a

33
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:14,158
couple functions as some secondary

34
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:17,819
actions one is root initiation another

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,920
is vascular tissue differentiation 3 is

36
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,589
tropic response force apical dominance

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,019
and 5 is a development of excellent buds

38
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,030
flowers and fruits and I'm going to talk

39
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,539
about these a little bit more detail

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,629
this is again the hormone here oxen that

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,750
we're gonna be talking about so starting

42
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,640
with promoting rooting well as we see

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,340
here here's example of some cuttings

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,570
taken with no oxen applied and it's see

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,390
the root development on them is quite

46
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:49,258
poor when oxen is applied that we see a

47
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,269
much more advantageous formation we see

48
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,090
here also comparison of different parts

49
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:56,340
per million of a particular oxen at 0 we

50
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,560
see hardly any root formation and as we

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,140
increase our oxen levels we see an

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,939
increase in the rooting percentage in

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,920
total now a da is a type of oxen and

54
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,889
we're seeing here the same kind of

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,080
increase in rooting from initially no

56
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,799
oxen added however what's interesting

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,500
here

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,439
is that 2 grams per liter we see more

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,560
roots then at 16 grams per liter so

60
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,490
other kind of shows here is our routing

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,610
increases to a certain point and then

62
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,560
plateaus it can even if we increase

63
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,180
oxygen concentrations too much you can

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,909
actually cut a slight decrease in our

65
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,340
routing that we see here so more is not

66
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:37,199
better and auxins but definitely some is

67
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,340
better than none as far as increasing

68
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:43,949
our routing there's many products that

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,590
are used to promote this lateral buds of

70
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:49,079
roots I should say to form and we notice

71
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,000
here hormone in is a very common form in

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,240
1 2 &amp; 3 we've heard of different

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,789
concentrations clone ex is another form

74
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,219
of an IBA here that you can apply to

75
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:01,289
plants to increase the routing now with

76
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,210
both of these auctions in general might

77
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:06,509
be a little unstable it's good to keep

78
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,939
those products stored in the fridge cool

79
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,620
temperatures to make the auxin last as

80
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:14,819
long as possible so there should be as

81
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,099
effective now i'll simpliciter Olinda

82
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,219
freshen of vascular tissue well there's

83
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,680
a wound site oxen will be involved here

84
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,080
to differentiate tissue to repair a

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,909
vascular system we kind of see here a

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,590
little bit loose highlighted on the

87
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,750
vascular system in the Mara's almond or

88
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,310
phloem and oxygen plays a role in cells

89
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:37,409
differentiating into those particular

90
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:39,150
vascular tissues this one here so we

91
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,659
notice that auxins of all the tropic

92
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,270
responses and tropism refers to growth

93
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,479
in response to a stimulus there's light

94
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,909
and sense of sunlight water where the

95
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,429
water's might be located we just want to

96
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:55,709
maybe go towards that in gravity this is

97
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,750
how roots know to go down and shoots

98
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,090
know to come up so we see here is our

99
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,650
light response here well it's important

100
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,150
here on the light response we see in

101
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,170
this case these two plants bending

102
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,750
towards the light

103
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:09,149
now all this does occur this occurs

104
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,009
because of auxin so we see here in the

105
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,319
first image here the light is right

106
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,840
above the plant and these are awesome

107
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,298
concentration it's pretty even however

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,879
now is that light source is a little bit

109
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,569
more to the side here notice our plant

110
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,788
kind of starting to bend over towards

111
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,269
the light and what's happening in order

112
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:30,779
for the plan

113
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:33,899
to bend like that the cells on one side

114
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:36,329
need to basically get bigger so oxen

115
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:39,959
concentrations increase causing these

116
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,839
cells to get larger and these elongation

117
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,598
of cells cause the plant to bend because

118
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,299
we have basically the same Erie on each

119
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:49,800
side well one side gets longer we're

120
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,470
noticing that that side it's gonna get

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,870
longer it's gonna start to push over and

122
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,789
bend towards the light you can think of

123
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,329
this if you're running around a track

124
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:02,068
right the lot on the outer circle is a

125
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:04,680
longer distance and on the inner circle

126
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:06,120
so here with these elongation of cells

127
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,860
this is a little bit longer that's going

128
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,269
to cause the plant to bend towards the

129
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,038
light and that's what you see here so

130
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,719
while we see the plant meting towards

131
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,379
the light that's actually because of the

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,289
hormone auxin promotes apical dominance

133
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:22,228
apical dominance is in today inventory

134
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:24,120
influence on the apical bud upon lateral

135
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:26,610
buds so what does this mean well first

136
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,740
our apical bud is at the top lateral

137
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,538
buds are on the side so a plant that has

138
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,090
strong apical dominance would be example

139
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,779
here it's a strong triangle kind of

140
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,609
shape strong kind of sense of that

141
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:39,869
central bud there

142
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,180
weak apical dominance is this kind of

143
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,069
weeping tree where we don't see a point

144
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,319
we don't see a point don't see kind of

145
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:48,449
the middle part doesn't have that nice

146
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,580
symmetrical shape here very weak apical

147
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,718
dominance this is also involved in point

148
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,478
setting of plants if you look very

149
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:56,990
carefully at points edea that's a large

150
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,218
bush like form that looks more like this

151
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,240
you'll notice in the center there's

152
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:05,129
pinch points these apical dominance sees

153
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,439
leading shoots have been pinched and

154
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:10,848
that is causing this lateral blood

155
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,829
formation to occur we see that here also

156
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:16,168
so this inhibitory influence on the

157
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:17,728
apical bud upon lateral buds well when

158
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:20,519
we have a normally growing plant here

159
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:22,379
that actively growing the bud tip has a

160
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,019
lot of oxygen in it that shoe tip is a

161
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,149
source of option that inhibits lateral

162
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,500
Bloods from forming so here's our

163
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,598
developing buds and they're kind of kept

164
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,389
in that kind of slow development dormant

165
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:36,209
like state however when we pinched the

166
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,819
top of that we're removing the oxen and

167
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:40,680
now with the reduced amount of oxen

168
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,719
there's no more suppression to

169
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,668
lateral buds and we see these Laurel

170
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,759
Bloods being growing at a much greater

171
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:50,370
rate than they are here evident here we

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,960
see our Tillery buds if we pinch that

173
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,829
top portion off these will be encouraged

174
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,430
to grow out

175
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:58,349
however we pinched the top off we notice

176
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,800
the lateral buds grow but when we pinch

177
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,110
the top off if we add oxen supplemental

178
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,418
oxen we notice that those lateral buds

179
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,729
never develop this is a way to prove

180
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,129
that oxen is the ones suppressing

181
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:13,409
lateral blood formation so this is

182
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,288
important if a plant actually breaks the

183
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,000
tip off because of wind or animals come

184
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:19,800
along and eat it that's going to remove

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,810
the oxen and that's gonna cause these

186
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,189
lateral buds to sprout however under

187
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,288
normal conditions the plant doesn't want

188
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,728
to compete with all these leaves so it's

189
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:30,538
just going to maintain that central

190
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:32,579
chute aquanauts fruit development so as

191
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,228
seeds mature they release oxygen to the

192
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,329
surrounding parts which develop into

193
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:39,360
fruit that covers the seeds so here a

194
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:41,639
normal fruit and we see little seeds

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,590
here now if we take out those seeds we

196
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,379
notice that the strawberry hair doesn't

197
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:48,299
grow nearly as good now if we take the

198
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,819
little seeds off and we spray it with

199
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,288
auxins but if we get someone a return to

200
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,728
normal not quite a hundred percent

201
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:55,800
because it's interacting with other

202
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:58,620
hormones but we see a much closer

203
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,270
resemblance of the normal fruit then if

204
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,629
we just take the seeds off limiting the

205
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:05,490
oxen from development this year

206
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:06,509
evidence of roll box information of

207
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,400
fruit and structures and similar

208
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,029
functions again here's our normal

209
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,888
strawberry

210
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,649
here's if we take all the seeds away and

211
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,939
this trial run is very interesting this

212
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:16,469
happens if we take up the end of those

213
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,990
seeds off there's a central kind of

214
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,880
equator point we noticed the fruit below

215
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,490
that point does not develop normally

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,168
with the fruit above that does so

217
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,728
without sea formation fruits do not

218
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:29,370
develop developin seeds are a source of

219
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:31,288
auxin so this just gives a little bit of

220
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,019
an example showing you normal conditions

221
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:38,838
and how the influence or dependence on

222
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:41,490
fruit development that oxen plays lastly

223
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,919
oxen or synthetic auxins are actually a

224
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,959
weed killer so while oxen is a plant

225
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,179
woman can help plants develop synthetic

226
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,789
auxins have a way of potentially

227
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:52,349
eliminating plants from growing so as

228
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:54,360
May synthetic auxins are used as

229
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,370
selectively weed killers or herbicides

230
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,889
this one called - for days used to

231
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,110
destroy broadleaf weeds does not affect

232
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:02,990
mature monocots causes plants to grow

233
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,610
itself to death basically grow so fast

234
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,039
they can't support itself an actual kill

235
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,289
itself more readily absorbed in

236
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,799
broadleaf plants so on certain weed

237
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:15,929
killers you may see them advertised as

238
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,549
kills weeds but not the grass because

239
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:19,349
it's got two four D it's a type of

240
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:22,049
synthetic oxen and it's a selective

241
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,370
broadleaf weed control selected in the

242
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:25,740
sense that's going to target mainly

243
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,328
dicots where monocots will not be as

244
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,459
affected by this especially if they're

245
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:31,889
mature hopefully that was helpful to

246
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,509
help explain a little bit of the hormone

247
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,689
oxen and how it can influence plant

248
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,689
growth
