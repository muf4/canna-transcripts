1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
in this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
video we're going to be looking at how

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
power readings change what the light

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
type and the distance those plants are

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,160
away from those lights we're going to be

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,359
comparing an led light with a

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,359
fluorescent light in this video

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,439
[Music]

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,960
before i get into the video i just want

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
to show you the two different types of

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
lights are going to be

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,198
looked at in this video the led light is

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,119
a fluent spider x plus 660 watt and the

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,960
fluorescent light is an aggro bright

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,399
designer t5 324 watt fluorescent light

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,679
just to have some background hope you

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
enjoy the video

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,320
so right now we're taking a par reading

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
with all of our lights on to measure how

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
different the readings are at different

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,238
distances

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,239
so right now at the absolute top we're

23
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,919
at a good

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,718
650.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,559
now at 6 inches down

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,960
we lower down to just 370.

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,478
at another six inches down we're

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,079
measuring 216.

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,079
go down another six inches

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,118
we're

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,640
just 120

32
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:20,239
and finally another six inches

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,159
we've made it down to 64. double digits

34
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,920
so that's why it's very important to

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,240
know how far away you're going to want

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:32,240
your plants to be from your light source

37
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:35,118
so now we're comparing our 600 watt led

38
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,959
lights to our fluorescent lights that we

39
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,959
were just showcasing as you can see

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,078
they're pretty much at the same height

41
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,719
level so this is just to compare how

42
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,399
drastically different the par rating is

43
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,000
at the same level just from a different

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
light

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,399
so right up at the top here we're

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,640
reading at two thousand

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,000
if we go six inches down

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,718
we lower down to a 780

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,519
12 inches down we're reading 630

50
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:10,239
18 inches down we're reading 558

51
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,318
and 24 inches down we're reading four

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
now i mean 390.

53
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,839
so you can see this is very different

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,439
and much more intense than the

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,159
fluorescent lights that we're currently

56
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,159
using on our clones

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
you
