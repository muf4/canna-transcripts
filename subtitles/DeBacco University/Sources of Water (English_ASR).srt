1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,779
so when we're irrigating our crops we

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,790
want to be considering what source of

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,230
water we're gonna utilize then some of

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,169
the common ones are rain water pond

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,570
water city or tap water in well water to

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,789
cover each of these sources briefly just

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,710
to give you some background on them so

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,448
first off rain water can be easily

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,910
collected by simply having a rain barrel

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,199
or collecting it off a roof

11
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,560
sadly this can be an unreliable source

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,118
and most of the time when it rains a lot

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,890
especially for outdoor operations you

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,149
don't need to irrigate a lot then when

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,740
it doesn't rain you don't have a lot of

16
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,019
water reserves and your plants need

17
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,750
irrigation so sometimes you can kind of

18
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,280
be working against yourself there also

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,750
it's not necessary this is easiest

20
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,370
setting up a rain barrel there's

21
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,079
actually 12 states that regulate the

22
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,058
collection of rainwater that I've listed

23
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,859
here so I've chosen to highlight

24
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,780
Colorado here because it is unique

25
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,469
I put the source right down here at the

26
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,960
bottom in 2009 Colorado where the

27
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:56,969
legislation session lasts a bill that

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
allows limited rainwater collection for

29
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,469
properties supplied by a well even then

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,629
that residents must apply for a permit

31
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,090
to do so this is why I just looked to

32
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,739
know that it's an illegal ought to

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,868
collect rainwater but sometimes in

34
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,969
certain states there are certain

35
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:15,659
processes to follow and that is simply

36
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:18,560
hooking up some pipes to it a rooftop

37
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,810
gutter system here and collecting it

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,210
let's go into pond water so pond water

39
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,000
now the pond water can be variable we're

40
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,048
looking at kind of more of a natural

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,700
surroundings to this pond and here a

42
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,590
little bit more of an urban setup

43
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,269
caution should be used when using this

44
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,359
type of water because especially in the

45
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,219
urban type setup you're looking at could

46
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,640
contain pesticides from weed weed

47
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,349
management in the local area also

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,969
sometimes pesticides or herbicides can

49
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,399
be added to the water itself to help

50
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,500
reduce some unwanted plant growth

51
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,599
it should be filtered regardless of what

52
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,280
type or physical and microbial

53
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,328
contaminants there should be a

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,009
mechanical filter that removes

55
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,379
particulate and that's just could be

56
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,840
sand could be mud could be just floating

57
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,968
debris and also it's recommend a UV

58
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,009
light pond filters used because it can

59
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,989
sterilize the water but this can have

60
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,189
some restriction on the flow rates so

61
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:09,840
while this wouldn't be a very efficient

62
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,509
method shown here this gives you an idea

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,650
of water is basically passed by a UV

64
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,109
light making

65
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,780
sterilize it and only the chance of

66
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,310
contaminating your plants in your soil

67
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,509
or your container growing media with

68
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,780
naturally occurring microbes that might

69
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:29,969
be present in pond water tap or city

70
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,400
water actual contents depend on the

71
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:33,628
physical location even town to town this

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,049
can relate to what they're adding to

73
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:39,658
that to help reduce you know potentially

74
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:41,760
eliminate hopefully the microbes that

75
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:43,739
would be growing in the water so this

76
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,060
could be chlorine Clarett amide there's

77
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,889
a whole bunch of different types of

78
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,859
basically sterilants that are used

79
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,969
that's why it can vary from town to town

80
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:53,819
likely contains some form of chlorine

81
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:55,530
and salts get your water tested or call

82
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:57,628
your water Trent for current report

83
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,759
they're very good about reporting and

84
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:01,949
providing it with that information it's

85
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,138
advised to check the tap water during

86
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,179
the year to see if changes occur and

87
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,030
this could be areas if there's a lot of

88
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,340
tourists that come in higher demands on

89
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,620
water or summertime versus winter it's

90
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,170
good to just get an idea to see if there

91
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,819
are changes that do occur over the year

92
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:19,918
well water all of its e-minor should be

93
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:22,679
applied to tap water there's a

94
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,389
likelihood of greater changes is

95
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,370
possible with low water coming

96
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,199
classified as hard water and it contains

97
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,689
a lot of minerals temperatures and other

98
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,250
factors it can be a cold shock to plants

99
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,289
and may need to be heated before it's

100
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,680
applied this is a particular importance

101
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:39,328
for very deep wells also with all wells

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,489
you should watch the flow rate and the

103
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,199
well replenish rate how quick will that

104
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,939
well replenish the water that's in it

105
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,739
and I say well typically they're not

106
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,959
open wells like this so you have ten of

107
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,370
the Bukit on the rope they're typically

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,469
drilled and this is one that was

109
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,699
recently drilled in the area here you

110
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,098
can see the sand around it with their

111
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,590
drill down and just be mindful to not

112
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,358
run your well dry be mindful of the flow

113
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,310
rate that it can support and also the

114
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,859
rate you can replenish itself so that

115
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,060
you're able to keep that well and as a

116
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,060
reliable water source
