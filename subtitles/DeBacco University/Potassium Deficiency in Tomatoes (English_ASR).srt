1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
you were to look at potassium deficiency

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,820
in tomatoes we see kind of a great image

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,059
here of initial onset of a potassium

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,980
deficiency Taylor what potassium does in

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,528
the tomato plant and how to correct it

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,890
or prevent a potential deficiency in

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:21,929
your plants so first off potassium just

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,420
in general what does it do why do plants

9
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,189
need it keep in mind that it is a mobile

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,189
nutrient so plants can kind of move or

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,480
translocate that through the plant

12
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,250
plants deficient potassium tend to be

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,920
less resistant to environmental stresses

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,808
diseases nematode attacks this is why

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,090
it's important for growers to make sure

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,519
their plants are not becoming potassium

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,219
deficient in addition that can also

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,109
affect quality such as shape the color

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,450
the vigor the size of the actual

20
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,519
tomatoes can actually cause a yellow

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,489
shouldering as well as we see that kind

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,770
of up here activates up to sixty enzymes

23
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,538
involved as growth helps translocate

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,910
sugars and starches within the plant

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,410
increases protein content maintains

26
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,839
trigger pressure its water pressure

27
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,518
reduces water loss and wilting so you

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,799
could see this is involved in a lot of

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,530
things most notably as I said for the

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,320
marketable fruit a yellow shouldering is

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,150
one kind of issue that can occur in that

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,379
allow customers to even pick up your

33
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,020
item and to purchase now to better show

34
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,759
a deficiency did I chose to grow tomato

35
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,158
plants in a hydroponic setup in a

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,629
greenhouse which allowed for precise

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
control you're also going to see a

38
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,069
comparison of a control plant that had

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,599
the optimum rates of all nutrients and

40
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,298
then a test plant was potassium

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,759
deficient so this kind of shows the

42
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,610
image here of the potassium deficient

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,109
plant these are the lower leaves they

44
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,540
will start to get a yellowing kind of

45
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,159
color to them towards the margins so we

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,759
can see that right here here and here

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,290
and these are the older leaves so the

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,099
original root stock would be all the way

49
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,219
to the right of the image here and above

50
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,599
me here is kind of the newer growth so

51
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,989
typically those older leaves are

52
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,609
impacted first they will have the first

53
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,280
ones to sharpen it to show this

54
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,840
yellowing or this discoloration so

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
that's important to keep in mind of

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,300
where you might be seeing the yellowing

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,340
leaves where they might be occurring for

58
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,900
the older leaves and towards the margins

59
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,939
you may have a potassium deficiency

60
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,439
starting now on our older leaves this

61
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:24,939
kind of shows that newer part of the

62
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,340
growth as I said they start to get that

63
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,310
yellowing first now the newer growth may

64
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,379
look perfectly fine and normal so keep

65
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,229
that in mind that while they look normal

66
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:37,000
now if no corrective measures are taken

67
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:39,489
they will start to exhibit the same

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,050
yellowing so it's important to make sure

69
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,490
that you're looking at those older

70
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,260
leaves notice had oh they're older gonna

71
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,740
die anyway this could be a sign of

72
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:49,689
something progressing through the plant

73
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,240
notice compared to the control plant so

74
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,099
as I said the - potassium to control

75
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,710
notice the newer growth looks very

76
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,599
similar green pattern looks the same but

77
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,430
we do not see that yellowing of the leaf

78
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,859
margins of the older leaves in the

79
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,099
control one that was fed a balanced

80
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,230
fertilizer now how to prevent this or

81
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,120
how to correct the potential deficiency

82
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,889
if you do notice it will keep in mind

83
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,900
potestas important for fruit finishing

84
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,099
in the end yield so it might be

85
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,000
something you might see a little bit

86
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:21,639
later in the season or past flower fruit

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,590
set tends to be needed in eggs in that

88
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,629
more mid to late season sulphate of

89
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,700
potash zero zero fifty is 50 percent

90
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:30,250
potassium typically applied based on a

91
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:32,379
soil test has a very low salt level and

92
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,209
only adds potassium so a great product

93
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,549
to choose especially if you can add it

94
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,000
to the soil before the plants go in the

95
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,560
ground

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,810
potassium chloride one it's very

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,340
commonly used zero zero 61

98
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,310
it's got a greater percentage of

99
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,840
potassium higher percent of that

100
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,939
compared to the sulphate of potash that

101
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,459
I mentioned previously but it does have

102
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,629
more salts with it it's a chloride so

103
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,479
just keep that in mind

104
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:57,789
kelp used by a lot of organic growers

105
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,099
great source of potassium usually about

106
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:01,870
a teaspoon of powder or two ounces of

107
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,930
liquid per gallon can be applied to the

108
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,430
leaves it's organic however keep in mind

109
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,280
that while it is a source of potassium

110
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,620
it's nowhere near the 50 or 60 percent

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,449
of the two previous products so it's not

112
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,640
really concentrated enough to typically

113
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,139
correct a deficiency so just keep that

114
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,969
in mind it's good to kind of supplement

115
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,519
and keep the plants ongoing but if you

116
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,830
have a deficiency it may take a lot a

117
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,620
lot of kelp a little excessive amounts

118
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:28,810
of kelp almost at that point to correct

119
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,329
efficiency so just keep that in mind

120
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,889
that wall does have potassium it's not

121
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:36,448
nearly as concentrated as the other

122
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,449
fertilizers that have mentioned here
