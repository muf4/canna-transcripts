1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,678
in this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,160
going to look at a slightly different

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,639
spin

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,638
on outdoor production of cannabis

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:17,759
looking at being having it being grown

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:18,960
in containers

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,760
all right let's get into growing

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,679
cannabis outdoors in containers

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,039
so first off this is similar to direct

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,960
soil planting

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
but of course a little different

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
planting cannabis into containers is

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,479
common for indoor applications

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
but it is gaining popularity with

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,398
outdoor growers as well

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,078
so why is this trend kind of occurring

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,000
well this is part because growers have

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,960
greater control over what the plants are

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,960
growing in

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
bitter control over the substrate here

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
because you're going to be putting it

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,519
into those

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,440
specific containers also with the

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
increase in fabric pot containers

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,079
popularity

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
these have become more cost effective

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,759
and are able to be utilized

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
by more growers as we see in the picture

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,358
right here now the process

30
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,119
is basically the same as planting in

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,559
soil but there's a little bit more

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,319
initial work to kind of fill the

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,879
containers up with your chosen

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,759
substrate now container planting's

35
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,000
advantages

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,960
is that if the soil is not conducive for

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
plant production

38
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,719
containers make a great alternative to

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,439
be able to use a field

40
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,359
that would otherwise not be profitable

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,239
weeding is often reduced as well as we

42
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,560
can see here

43
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,519
plants can also be staged in a cold

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,118
frame

45
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,239
able to push them get them bigger a

46
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,879
little bit bigger a little earlier in

47
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,319
the season

48
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,719
let me talk about weeding reduced here

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,239
we see some stone being utilized you

50
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,200
could also use greenhouse grade weed

51
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,798
block as well

52
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,478
to eliminate any weeds growing in the

53
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,680
pathways there of course will be some

54
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,400
weeds to kind of take out of the

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
containers

56
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
but you're definitely reducing your

57
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
overall area also the growing substrate

58
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
is under more exact control of the

59
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,478
grower and even though you can amend the

60
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
soil

61
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,679
here you're able to amend ahead of time

62
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,359
and maybe purchase this

63
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
specific substrate to fill the

64
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,478
containers with

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
now however there also are some

66
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,840
disadvantages and the first one being of

67
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
course the initial cost

68
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
looking at the containers the time and

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
labor it takes to fill those containers

70
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,960
and the use of an irrigation system

71
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
or you could go through hand watering in

72
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,280
that case the disadvantage would be the

73
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,199
time it would take

74
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,878
to go through and water the area so

75
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,238
let's look at this field kind of from a

76
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,519
field perspective

77
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
to give you a little bit more

78
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
information and relate it a little bit

79
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
better

80
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,360
to field application of growing cannabis

81
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,349
outdoors

82
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:32,560
but in containers

83
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:34,079
[Music]

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,159
so we're looking here at the soil

85
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,120
looking at a very dry surface

86
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,959
as you dig down there is a lot of water

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,319
just below the surface

88
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
in addition of course to everyone's

89
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,719
favorite rocks which makes it just a

90
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,719
difficult area to grow in

91
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,800
despite being all clear-cut and access

92
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,039
to the sun this grower decided

93
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
to take the leap and still grow in the

94
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,679
field but grow in a way that might be a

95
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,479
little more unique

96
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,080
i decided to grow in grow bags on a

97
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,119
large scale over a thousand

98
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
here so it makes it great to be able to

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,439
control

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,239
conditions and doesn't have to deal with

101
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,719
all of the

102
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
soil issues plants were started in the

103
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,519
soil initially

104
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,839
but then noticed that they weren't doing

105
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,640
so well so the transition was made

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
and since being transplanted the plants

107
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,279
have definitely responded in a positive

108
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,639
manner which is great to see the only

109
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,439
downfall with kind of making this

110
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,518
adjustment

111
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,359
later in the season is that they are

112
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,920
having to resort to hand

113
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
watering so it's a very laborious task

114
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,479
with a

115
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
thousand over a thousand plants here

116
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,399
that can take

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,400
upwards of two to three hours uh so

118
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
that's just important to keep in mind

119
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
when you are going through and making a

120
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
change like that

121
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,958
to keep in mind that the plants still

122
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,039
need their water and now they're going

123
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,158
to be dependent on you for that water

124
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,079
but there are plans to kind of go

125
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,519
through and automate this so there's

126
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
always room for improvement and

127
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
adjustments

128
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
and when the plants respond it makes it

129
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,518
that much more enjoyable

130
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,679
and that much more apt to kind of put

131
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
the time in to ensure that they're happy

132
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,080
because when the plants are happy it

133
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,360
always seems like the growers are happy

134
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,719
okay so if you're having challenges

135
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,159
growing in the field well this is

136
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,639
another way you can grow in the field

137
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,400
but

138
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,478
have a little bit more control over your

139
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,560
conditions here we see a bunch of these

140
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,238
grow bags here we have the cannabis

141
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
plants growing in grow bags

142
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,918
all nicely lined up to make it easy to

143
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,079
walk through

144
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,000
in field application here we've got a

145
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,879
lot of access to natural sun which

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,519
is great the soil can be amended it can

147
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,759
be

148
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,079
very specific on what you put in here

149
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
looking at approximately five gallons or

150
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,159
so volume of soil here

151
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,279
and looking out in total this area is

152
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
over a thousand

153
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,879
plants so there's a lot of labor that

154
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,918
goes into that but when you have control

155
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,399
over that it can help

156
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,758
improve your yields which is well worth

157
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,198
it and trying to grow in soil that

158
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
you're just not going to get the yields

159
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
from

160
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,039
so this is just an example of how

161
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,120
growers can kind of

162
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
work with what they've got and make

163
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,160
adjustments to help improve that yield

164
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,759
in the long run

165
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,080
so we're looking at why a grower may go

166
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,120
to grow bags well this is a perfect

167
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,719
example here seeing this giant large

168
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,879
rock indicating so it's removed from the

169
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
field and this field is very rocky

170
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,800
in addition after clear cutting it's

171
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,000
very can be very tough

172
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,680
to kind of grow in soil after plants

173
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,439
trees have been in there for a number of

174
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,400
years but we're also looking at some of

175
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,399
the plants

176
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,679
and that can help give us an indication

177
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,319
of the natural plan so what

178
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,959
would want to grow here we see a lot of

179
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,199
ferns

180
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,959
ferns indicate probably a lot of shade

181
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,960
in addition we have some running that

182
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,959
went on with the equipment

183
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,000
in this general area here the kind of

184
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,560
soil is very

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,519
wet near me on this other side we can

186
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,079
see that there is

187
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,079
a stream so if i pan around this way

188
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,280
mary here in the backdrop here you can

189
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,038
see a stream that is running by

190
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,319
this is again an indication that this

191
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,079
soil is

192
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,759
probably going to retain a lot of

193
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,839
moisture which is going to be great

194
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,680
during a dry year but make it a

195
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,758
challenge to grow plants in

196
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,120
especially when that water might be so

197
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,720
close to the surface

198
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
it could be a challenge to get roots to

199
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
be able to breathe

200
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
so when we have all these conditions and

201
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,318
the grower did try

202
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,240
to put the plants in the soil initially

203
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,360
just pan around here

204
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,280
well they noticed that they had

205
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,879
struggled quite a bit

206
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,439
so seeing them struggle at that point

207
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,719
it was justified to be able to kind of

208
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,079
go through

209
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,960
and plant this large planting with grow

210
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,879
bags

211
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,038
to take advantage of the area that had

212
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,120
been cleared for access to sun

213
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,879
but that limited the amount that they

214
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,519
could get based on soil so this gave the

215
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,199
grower control over what was in the soil

216
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,799
and ultimate control over plant

217
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
performance

218
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,478
so a lot of people may consider grow

219
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,560
bags to be a smaller operation where

220
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,159
you're trying to grow in a grow tent

221
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
but this just shows how you can grow in

222
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
a large field application with grow bags

223
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
if you're willing to supply some of the

224
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
labor and to go through the work

225
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,799
to set it up and is it justified here

226
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,560
looking at the soil type justify growing

227
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,319
grow bags you can see the plants are

228
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,038
doing well

229
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
this again just shows a large area that

230
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,038
can be planted and

231
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,079
grow bags if you can justify it the

232
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,639
labor

233
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,959
i see the plants can do quite well

234
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,280
they're establishing themselves nicely

235
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,560
grower has control over what goes into

236
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:31,679
that soil there

237
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:31,680
and adjustments can be made
