1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,400
in this debaco university video i'll go

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,679
over planning the arrival date of

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,160
cannabis clones

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:17,920
once you get them shipped in to allow

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,920
you to maximize your harvest

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
all right let's go over planning the

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,000
arrival date for your cannabis clones

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,598
well first off when planning for the

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
arrival date you really actually want to

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,160
start with

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
the harvest date and when it comes to

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
selecting that

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,679
ideal arrival date or week you first

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,039
want to consider when is your harvest

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,399
date going to be

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,920
if you're looking at an outdoor

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
operation you know when are the leaves

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
going to start

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,919
turning when is the photo period going

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,520
to start changing this is what you

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,679
should take into consideration

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,359
for when you want the plants to come in

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,200
you also want to be mindful of your

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,759
typical for outdoor locations

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,879
your typical starting and end day of the

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,399
growing season

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,079
when's your last frost and when's your

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,558
first frost date that you're in

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,359
for your area now if you're in an indoor

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,280
operation

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,198
you have much more flexibility and it

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,960
really depends on

33
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,239
if all of the equipment is operational

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,118
you know because you have control over

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,478
the environment

36
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,239
control over the photo period the

37
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,438
lighting the temperature hopefully the

38
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,280
air circulation

39
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,519
you have a lot more opportunities for

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,239
flexibility outdoor locations

41
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,200
definitely more limited and a little bit

42
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,359
more precise

43
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,640
with the date they want their clones to

44
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,159
come in

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,079
now for outdoor locations you want to

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,520
know your growing season and there's

47
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,158
plenty of these charts for different

48
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,438
areas

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
i want to know what your plant hearty

50
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,879
note hardiness zone map is what region

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
you're in

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,478
this can really help you best pinpoint

53
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,240
the ideal

54
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,959
location for of your location ideal

55
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,559
timing

56
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,919
for your given location i'm going to

57
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
give you an example here for the

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
southern new england

59
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,000
area uh later in this presentation

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,359
so you want to also consider the photo

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,640
period so the photo period can be

62
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,519
determined the flowering time

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
except for if you're planting

64
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,840
autoflowers so be sure to be

65
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
the plant timing will allow for plants

66
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
to be large enough

67
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
to support flowering you don't want to

68
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,718
have it be too late or too early

69
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,078
here we see some photo period changes in

70
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,438
the duration of time

71
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,439
we're looking at the temperature lag

72
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,199
behind photo periods again all factors

73
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,959
to take into consideration

74
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,878
we can see the description of that

75
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,120
located um right here

76
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,878
uh for the given area in japan but again

77
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
this is true for any area

78
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,840
so be mindful of what it is for your

79
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,439
area so you can maximize your production

80
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,878
now my as i said later i was going to

81
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,000
give you that earlier i should say i was

82
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,120
going to give you that southern new

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
england example

84
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
and gel recommendation is to have clones

85
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,840
arrive in early june that first or

86
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,279
second week of june

87
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,878
and if growers want to have a second

88
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
planting that should arrive in

89
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,000
late june or potentially very early in

90
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,319
july

91
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,280
now when we're considering this for the

92
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,039
southern new england

93
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,719
area it kind of matches the native

94
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,479
strawberry timing

95
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,000
so again just something else there to

96
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,919
use some native plants in your

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519
area to kind of gauge what timing you

98
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,878
should have some people may use

99
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
different trees different bushes for

100
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,000
flowering times

101
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,280
to give you an idea of when the season

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,039
is just right

103
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
so take this all the consideration but

104
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,039
hopefully you can get that timing down

105
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,158
to maximize your growing season and

106
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,840
ultimately

107
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,840
maximize your harvest
