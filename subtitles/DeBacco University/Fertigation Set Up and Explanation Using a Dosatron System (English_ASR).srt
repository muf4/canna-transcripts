1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,278
this debaco University video is going to

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:08,160
go over an efficient way to fertilize

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,679
your plants this is going to look

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,839
specifically at a fertigation setup an

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,879
explanation using a dosatron system

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,739
though any chemical injector could be

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,300
supplemented other than the name brand

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,299
dosatrines that you'll see here

9
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:29,098
[Music]

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,480
well as mentioned before dosatron is

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,179
simply the name brand for a chemical

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,759
injector this is often considered to be

13
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,219
the industry standard and typically used

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,659
in many Greenhouse situations but there

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,939
are other brands if you search for them

16
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,558
this works in a simile to most of the

17
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,859
other chemical injectors it is a water

18
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:50,039
powered non-electric chemical injector

19
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,200
so it makes it very great for

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,058
transportation for moving around you can

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,160
make it portable in this case they're in

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,078
a fixed position but there's basically

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,759
the power of water that's supplied

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,100
through the irrigation lines it's what

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,019
powers them this offers an easy and

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,939
reliable way to accurately inject

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,040
chemicals into the water lines and

28
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,298
fertilizers this class of injectors

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,580
works by using a volumetric

30
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,979
proportioning which helps maintain

31
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,319
consistent mixing rates despite changes

32
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,879
that may occur in water pressure or in

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,798
water flow

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,298
so how does it actually work well if

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,460
we're kind of looking at the exact kind

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,200
of method here this is the dose of

37
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,879
drawing here we could see area one is

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,978
the water flow so your water is flowing

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,679
in here from the left to right the water

40
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,900
enters the dosatron body right here the

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,060
concentrate is then pulled up through

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,820
the dosatron through the you'd have a

43
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,560
tank down here and it'd be pulled up the

44
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,658
concentrate mix is with the incoming

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
water in this chamber right here and

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,859
then the Blended solution is discarded

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,500
out into the water line so you'll hear

48
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,700
this kind of like click click click

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,019
um in the video that Connor's going to

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,000
show us and that's basically what that

51
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,399
clicking noise is is this kind of piston

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,500
moving up and down moving up to bring up

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,079
that concentrate and going down mixing

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,899
it with the water and then ensuring that

55
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,819
the consistent dosing is going out the

56
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,960
lines from the concentrated solution

57
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,699
here

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,219
now in this case it's being hooked up to

59
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,500
a dripper emitter irrigation system each

60
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,598
container has a dedicated emitter that

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,979
can involve multiple Outlets which are

62
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,799
especially important for larger

63
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,679
container plants however be sure there

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,360
are you're checking for sediments and

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,219
any clogs that may occur in the system

66
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,620
because while this is very efficient

67
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,840
there can be clogs that can occur

68
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,520
especially on long runs in the

69
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,620
greenhouse situation

70
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,780
now the dosatron system as I said could

71
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,120
be fixed on the wall or actually can be

72
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,039
very mobile it's a very efficient method

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,500
for dosing fertilizer from stock tanks

74
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,139
this reduces the need to mix fertilizers

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,900
daily and can also ensure consistency of

76
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,759
nutrients delivered to the plants these

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,700
are water driven Piston Pumps that can

78
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,799
be set at to a ratio and adjust to the

79
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,659
flow of water so if you have an uneven

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
water pressure they will adjust to

81
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,859
ensure you're not over or under

82
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,900
fertilizing they're also be familiar

83
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,120
click sound that will ensure the proper

84
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,739
functioning can alert you to when

85
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,420
something may not be right maybe you're

86
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,878
noticing that drop in water pressure or

87
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,738
water flow maybe there's a filter that's

88
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,359
clogged these are all little indications

89
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,340
once you get to know what the normal is

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,560
you'll be able easily to tell what the

91
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,658
abnormal is check valves are recommended

92
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,580
or often required to prevent backflow if

93
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,039
you're using a public water supply so

94
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,019
again just keep that note in mind

95
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,179
now there's also more than fertilizer

96
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,439
you can also clean through them so this

97
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,480
system can be used for fertilizing

98
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,459
plants as we see just a couple example

99
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,859
nutrients here the same system could

100
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,479
also be used for a line cleaner as we'll

101
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,799
hear Connor mention that when you're

102
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,719
trying to prevent those clogs prevent

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,700
any sort of buildup of particulate

104
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,019
matter you can take these out and you

105
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,060
can put it through a line cleaner and

106
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,640
then clean all the lines out as well so

107
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,739
again offers great efficiency

108
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,419
now there are importance for filters so

109
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,640
not just a chemical form of cleaning but

110
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,079
filters are important pre-filter should

111
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,059
be installed to catch anything that

112
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,819
comes in the lines before it reaches the

113
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,439
dosatron system intake filters are

114
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,179
basically at the very ends or at the

115
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,158
bottom as we can see down here in the

116
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,540
concentrate and they're tubes that

117
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,219
connect to that fertilizer so there

118
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,900
should be a filter here there should be

119
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,699
a filter here and there should even be

120
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,560
post filters that can be installed to

121
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,959
ensure no large particulate goes out the

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,120
emitters from the dosatron I'd rather

123
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,100
clog filters and change the filters out

124
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,160
than have to worry about clogging all of

125
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,360
my lines Downstream of this so filters

126
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
while they might seem a little Annoying

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,080
if they're clogging and I'd rather

128
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,759
they're very easy to clean get into a

129
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,680
pattern than going through and clogging

130
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,180
your entire system

131
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,319
so here's a little bit about the

132
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,860
background of the system you're going to

133
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,839
see here it's a part A B and C system a

134
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,100
is just a general fertilizer of 15 12

135
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,959
26. Part B is a calcium nitrate 1500 so

136
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,400
it's nitrogen phosphorus and potassium

137
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:57,060
Bloom bus booster here 10 20 30 10

138
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,799
nitrogen 30 phosphorus 20 potassium and

139
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,079
then when needed this root drip to kind

140
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,939
of clean the lines here uh can also be

141
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,159
added through this efficient dosatron

142
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,139
chemi-injecting system

143
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,360
so be sure to check the product label

144
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,759
for uh suggested dosing typically it

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,500
stayed for a 1 to 100 ratio which is

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,960
what the dosatrons are often set at and

147
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,079
that's what we'll see here it says here

148
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,299
I add 13 ounces of fertilizer to be

149
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,379
added per gallon to the stock feeding

150
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,840
tank so that's going to be your

151
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,459
concentrated mix given the standard

152
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,439
ratio it also makes it easier for

153
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,060
Growers to make adjustments for example

154
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,639
if you want to inject at a 1 to 200

155
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,160
ratio you double the concentration or if

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,918
you had a 150 ratio you basically have

157
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,080
the concentration as stated

158
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,939
so we've talked about it enough let's

159
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,279
see in action let's hear kind of go

160
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,779
through the system set up here so you

161
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,299
can see and get familiar with that

162
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,978
clicking sound and kind of walk us

163
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,660
through this system so you can see it in

164
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:54,300
action now that you've learned about the

165
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,039
basics how's everybody doing today

166
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,560
um so today we're looking at our

167
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,959
dosatron this is our nutrient delivery

168
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,300
system and this is how we

169
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,000
pushed our nutrients out to the

170
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,300
greenhouse without having to constantly

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,819
mix new nutrients every day

172
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,000
um we have three tanks part A Part B and

173
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:17,478
our bloom our part A is a general

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,639
uh kind of growing ratio

175
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,839
mostly favoring the potassium and the

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
phosphorus

177
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,719
are Part B is a calcium nitrate high in

178
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,860
nitrogen this is our for our green

179
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,720
growth

180
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,160
and then if we look over here our Bloom

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,340
is a simple

182
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,919
one three two mix and this is mostly for

183
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,879
flour we turn this on for our flowering

184
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,599
girls

185
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,159
and um how does it work well

186
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,740
the dosatron

187
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,860
has three Pistons each piston is

188
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,319
connected to our Reservoir tanks and

189
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,120
there's no electricity involved it's all

190
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,199
powered by the flow of water

191
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,939
so

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,699
water comes in

193
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:02,639
through our intake

194
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,720
goes through the dosatron and the Piston

195
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,819
right here

196
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,819
as the water the force the water goes

197
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:12,300
through it the Piston shoots up releases

198
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:15,000
a certain amount that you can set right

199
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,800
here of our nutrients into our

200
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,519
mainstream of water and so you can have

201
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,038
a

202
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,079
for my setup we can have three Pistons

203
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,300
going at once pushing in three different

204
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,740
types of nutrients

205
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,020
um it's very cool it's very efficient

206
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,259
and you don't have to constantly be

207
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,639
filling every day or every few days new

208
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,439
nutrients because you're running out so

209
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,139
much you can just use this and use your

210
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,478
main water supply and just push it all

211
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,160
right out to the greenhouse

212
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,500
now

213
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,240
some things that may happen when using a

214
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,399
dosatron and the irrigation lines that

215
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,639
we have out in the greenhouse you may

216
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,459
get clogs and when getting clogs you can

217
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,220
also use the dosatron to correct those

218
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:59,879
clogs right here we have hypochlorous

219
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,220
acid root drip it's called and you can

220
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,538
actually set the dosatron

221
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,720
to

222
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:08,279
the root drip solution so you can

223
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,979
accurately dose your water with your

224
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,359
hypochlorous acid and that will push

225
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:14,519
everything out through your irrigation

226
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,860
lines not only that it's safe for your

227
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,779
roots so clean the roots as well along

228
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,220
with pushing everything out through the

229
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,098
lines

230
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,660
um the dosatron is very useful because

231
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,120
it can be used for a variety of things

232
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,180
not just nutrients like the irrigation

233
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,418
Line Cleaner you can also put say a

234
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,060
foliar spray or a some type of spray for

235
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:39,538
insect control and you can actually set

236
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,759
the dosatron make your own tank and just

237
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:46,019
use your dosatron out in the greenhouse

238
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,519
which is very useful in time saving

239
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,860
um so I'm going to turn it on for you

240
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,080
guys and you can listen

241
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,360
to the satisfying click that these

242
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,519
Pistons make as it pushes in our

243
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,620
nutrients into our water

244
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,639
this is our our bypass switch so this

245
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,379
controls

246
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,059
water going in

247
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:04,620
if this is closed it goes through the

248
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,599
dosatron if it's open it skips the

249
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,259
dosatron and I just get plain water out

250
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,459
into the greenhouse

251
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:14,600
and that's just some air bubbles working

252
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,599
its way through the dosatron

253
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,479
now you just listen

254
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,479
[Music]

255
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,360
yeah it's pretty simple when you think

256
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,080
about it

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,300
um

258
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,700
one thing to note is that each outtake

259
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,099
of the dosatron has filters

260
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,660
so in here you can actually unscrew

261
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,519
there's filters in there that prevent

262
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,039
any particulates from getting into the

263
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,860
dosatron and messing with the system

264
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,958
on the end of our tubes we have filters

265
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,278
on the very bottom in the tubes that

266
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,239
prevents anything from our nutrients

267
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,220
getting in

268
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,899
and we don't have it installed currently

269
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,580
but there would also be a filter in here

270
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,159
that would filter out anything coming

271
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,800
out of the dosatron into the greenhouse

272
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,159
along with that we have filters I know a

273
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,958
lot of filters more filters on the

274
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,059
outtakes in the

275
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,619
actual Greenhouse so there's a lot of

276
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,719
filtration going on and that's to try to

277
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,259
avoid that buildup in our drip lines

278
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,180
that we use our hypochlorous acid to fix

279
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,519
another thing to note when using the

280
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:26,099
dosatron especially with your nutrients

281
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,919
and your other concentrates that you're

282
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,500
putting in your tanks is that oftentimes

283
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,778
the labels will have dosaton

284
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,299
concentrations and ratios already

285
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:41,100
printed and figured out for you

286
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:45,059
so for example here on my Jax part A we

287
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,519
have a for injectors at a 1 100th ratio

288
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,619
which we are all set

289
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,600
we have one percent of this solution

290
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,159
going through

291
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,278
into our main

292
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,759
um water supply so for our

293
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,559
Jax part A we would have 13 ounces per

294
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,139
gallon

295
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,639
of stock in this tank and that ratio

296
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,159
would be the correct amount to

297
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,899
accurately dose our entire Greenhouse

298
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,919
and yeah

299
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,919
that's the docentron
