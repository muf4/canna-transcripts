1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
okay we're going to do a brief overview

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,390
of the lymphatic system which we look at

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,029
this image it does have a lot of at

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:11,428
least visual similarities to the general

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,109
circulatory system of our body and it

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,480
does work in close proximity with our

7
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:19,289
circulatory system as well as our immune

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,118
system so moving on so lymphatic system

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,920
recovering the lost fluid so what is

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,660
kind of referring to well the

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,618
cardiovascular system is actually very

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,480
leaky the process of moving blood going

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,179
through capillaries actually creates

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,920
some loss of some fluid so the goal of

15
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,799
the lymphatic system is to collect and

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,439
recycle leaked fluid the body uses the

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,569
secondary the circulatory system called

18
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,579
the lymphatic system so you can think of

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,558
the reason why it looks so similar to

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,840
the circulatory system and as we can see

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,419
with our capillaries here it's in very

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,969
close proximity to that circulatory

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,410
system as a way to kind of recycle and

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,689
collect LEEP fluid there's three main

25
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,468
functions of the lymphatic system and

26
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,438
here's one of them

27
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,570
this is returns proteins to circulation

28
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,339
so while we're moving things through our

29
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,500
capillaries and things are diffusing the

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,500
cross want to make sure returning

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,030
proteins are not lost outside the

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,430
circulatory system we want to bring them

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,099
back in because if proteins are not

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,080
returned to the blood the conditions

35
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,959
here this is kind of stage 1 stage 2

36
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,329
stage 3 and extreme stage 4 here called

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,129
edema and this is body swelling will

38
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,109
ultimately result if we have this

39
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:35,209
accumulation of proteins and not

40
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:37,530
returning them via the lymphatic system

41
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,599
blood pressure forces fluid out of the

42
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,549
capillary so why does this occur well

43
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,578
most of the interstitial fluid returns

44
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,280
by as Moses however excessive fluid is

45
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:48,989
drained into the lymphatic system

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,810
capillaries in the lymphatic system this

47
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:55,169
fluid is called lymph so the lymph nodes

48
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,478
the lymphatic system transport limp and

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,478
the vessels here contain a series of

50
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:04,140
one-way valves when they permit movement

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,849
only in one direction now here's a kind

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,128
of our arteries and our veins or

53
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,500
interstitial space we can see things

54
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,840
moving out things moving in this shows

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,469
the actual change in pressure gradient

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,050
at the Kapler

57
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,939
level the numbers represent the pressure

58
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,150
of the vesicles in millimeters of

59
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:23,069
mercury mm of HD so that's what the unit

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,780
is for these numbers in the errors in

61
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,150
the diagram show the magnitude in the

62
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,770
direction of the net movement and you

63
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,170
could take a look at that and clearly

64
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,740
see our artery pressures 37 mm of

65
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:37,229
mercury and the venule here is 17

66
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,150
millimeters of mercury go ahead and the

67
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,549
second function here the lymphatic

68
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,490
system transports fats absorbed from the

69
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,410
intestines will lymph capillaries so you

70
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,709
hear typically in the green color here

71
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:52,340
or called electives this absorbed fats

72
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,500
from the small intestine remember back

73
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,990
remember that our intestines have a very

74
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,139
high surface area they do this with our

75
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,719
villi manases increasing the surface

76
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,869
here for nutrient exchange particularly

77
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,490
for the intestines nutrient absorption

78
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,230
we see here our lymphatic system is

79
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,250
working in close proximity they're

80
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:16,049
absorbing fats from the small intestine

81
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,580
number three or a last function of the

82
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,219
lymphatic system that we're gonna focus

83
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,290
on is aids in the body's defenses which

84
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,870
is the immune system so lymph nodes are

85
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,609
filled with white blood cells three

86
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,519
particular areas of importance are

87
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,650
tonsils we up here they contain many P

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,700
in b-cells and inflamed in response to

89
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,390
and infection the spleen located here

90
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,369
contains T cells B cells and macrophages

91
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,619
in our thalamus right here in the center

92
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,480
it's important during field development

93
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,159
in childhood and by the time you reach

94
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,310
puberty the immune system is mature and

95
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,739
the role of the thalamus is reduced and

96
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,949
not to zero but it is reduced at that

97
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,560
later stages in life now a tough

98
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,539
elective you may have had this may be

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,610
wondering or a little concerned going

100
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,329
back for one second that if tonsils

101
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,760
contain TB cells and is important may

102
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,500
inflame in response to an infection if

103
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,048
it had those removed would that be a

104
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,310
negative impact on us well the

105
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,769
connecting these two with the immune

106
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,410
system it's reasonable to say that there

107
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,389
is enough evidence to conclude that time

108
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,450
fluffiness has no clinical significant

109
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,159
negative effect on the immune system

110
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,329
provided a link to the article here this

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,759
is what infected

112
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,258
or in flames tonsils will look like they

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,900
have henna that those whitish spots

114
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,389
there here's the representative image of

115
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:39,239
a normal and our abnormal our unplaned

116
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,360
here this quote in this article was

117
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,970
based on a total of marine thirty-five

118
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,919
articles including almost two thousand

119
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,449
patients so they came the conclusion

120
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,459
that there's no clinical significant

121
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,400
negative effects on the immune system if

122
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,079
you've had your tonsils removed this is

123
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,000
a brief overview of the lymphatic system

124
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,189
here if you want to look at another

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,259
video this is a crash course video they

126
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,240
tie in the lymphatic system to airport

127
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,740
screening analogy also goes over a

128
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,199
regulating blood valium volumes

129
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,759
maintaining blood pressure improvement

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,038
with the immune system and is the

131
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,900
appendix really useless so welcome to

132
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,918
check that out edition hopefully you

133
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,918
found this video helpful
