00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,880
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,480
we'll be looking at carbon accident

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,519
levels of 800

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:17,920
to 1200 parts per million in cannabis

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:17,920
plant production

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
looking at elevating your grow area to

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,400
800 to 1200 parts per million

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
let's look and see how it relate to

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,640
cannabis production

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,079
well first off co2 levels in that range

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
while 400 parts per million

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,600
is considered normal atmospheric

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,359
conditions elevating levels above this

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
will require the use of several pieces

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,479
of equipment

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,159
goal is to increase the overall plant

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,679
yield so you can kind of see here

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,919
effective carbon oxide and net

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,840
photosynthesis realize that it's not a

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,600
linear progression it is kind of it

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,239
levels off it kind of plateaus at a

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,239
certain

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,000
level so the equipment list you're going

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,279
to need a source of carbon dioxide a

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,198
method to deliver that

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
a system to monitor the carbon dioxide

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,759
levels now keep in mind that options

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,760
are discussed in other videos this video

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,158
focuses on the chosen range

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,759
and its impact on plants and the image

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,640
right here shows if you were to use a

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
bottle system

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,400
but there are other options now the 800

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,560
to 1200 parts per million

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
well this level will allow growers to

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,920
justify using lights with high

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,560
outputs despite the increase in initial

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,799
and operating costs this will allow for

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,759
plants to pack on more biomass

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,680
in a shorter period of time note this

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,719
may require an adjustment when you flip

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,159
your plants from

43
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,599
veg to flower plants will also require

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,159
greater fertilizer to meet their

45
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,599
aggressive growing so this added cost

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
needs to also be taken into

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,959
consideration we see here just a general

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
par guy looking at when

49
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,319
carbon dioxide would be required you can

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
also see different

51
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,078
light levels at different distances

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,118
between the plant or leaf canopy to the

53
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,199
light source so why would you select

54
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,438
this particular range well this allows

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,118
plants to maximize highlight intensities

56
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,559
these levels have shown to maximize the

57
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,000
photosynthetic rate

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
plants can tolerate elevated

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
temperatures 86 to 90 degrees fahrenheit

60
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,878
simply put because the rubisco enzyme

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,120
which is a very crucial part to the

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,719
entire photosynthetic process it's an

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,719
enzyme and it can operate at greater

64
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,840
efficiencies with carbon dioxide levels

65
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,598
in this range

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
that's why plants are able to tolerate

67
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,119
those warmer temperatures

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,878
however like most biological systems

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,640
there is a theoretical maximum

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,079
and this is the optimum rate for the

71
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,719
enzyme so adding

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
more will not improve the rate it may

73
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,000
actually have negative impacts so while

74
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,759
it shifts a little bit warmer

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
you don't want to go much warmer than 90

76
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,039
degrees this is

77
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
very important if you're growing an

78
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,199
autoflower due to the fixed number of

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
days

80
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,479
from emergence to harvest so growers

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
should be

82
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,878
maximizing each and every day and this

83
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,199
is one highly recommended

84
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,560
method to be able to accomplish this

85
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,560
with autoflowers

86
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,719
that will produce a yield in a set

87
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
number of days this can help growers

88
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,759
maximize each and every day that you

89
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,680
have

90
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,679
within that fixed time span
