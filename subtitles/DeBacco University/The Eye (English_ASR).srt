1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
so here are we looking at the eye and

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,778
not just the human eye but vision in

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,789
general so on that topic

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,080
what decision well vision begins with

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:12,569
the capture of light energy by

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,699
photoreceptors many invertebrates have

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,339
simple visual systems in the sense that

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,309
they're photoreceptors are clustered in

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:23,250
eye spot they perceive lights direction

10
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:26,129
but not necessarily a visual image like

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,550
us and it's if you hear nice very simple

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,699
come very basic to very complex

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,100
development of the eye

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,409
now there's four phylum the abbe evolved

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,030
well-developed image-forming eyes

16
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:41,159
annelids mollis arthropods and

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,200
vertebrates this is our flat worm that

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,509
has just the eye spots and all they may

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,989
look like very distinctive eyes they're

20
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:51,210
simply only able to tell light from dark

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,669
eyes are strengthened ly similar in

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,859
structure but believed to have different

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,030
evolutionary paths amongst all of these

24
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:03,768
violet eyes if animals as we see here we

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,530
have our insect I very basic very large

26
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:09,658
area of reception there the human eye of

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,310
the vertebra compared to the octopus and

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,350
initially especially if you look at both

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,509
of these it look very similar however

30
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,879
what's distinctly different is the

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,759
number four region before it's the blind

32
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,310
spot in our eyes we have an area within

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,228
each eye very small but it's a blind

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,478
spot and what happens here is there's

35
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,728
lack of photoreceptors however in the

36
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,618
octopus eye there is no blind spot the

37
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,328
retina continuously in tearaway and

38
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,250
three is the optic nerve and that's

39
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,889
what's sending all this image all of

40
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,769
this information of the image to the

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,228
brain for processing continuing on the

42
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,840
structure of the vertebrate eye eye

43
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:47,819
works like a lens of focused camera via

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,950
the cornea located here and that's a

45
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,078
transparent covering that focuses light

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,570
we then have the lens which completes

47
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,819
the focusing and ciliary muscles that

48
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,250
change the shape of the lens now located

49
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,408
here and they can help pull or kind of

50
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,299
condense down that lens so that the

51
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,130
image could be properly focused on the

52
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,489
back of the eye where their retina is

53
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:10,409
located the iris is a shutter that

54
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,870
controls the amount of light allowed in

55
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,840
see that evident here the pupil is a

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,120
transparent

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,219
okay directly in the center the redness

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,840
at the back surface of the eye and the

59
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:23,769
retina contains two types of

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,259
photoreceptors both rods and cones the

61
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:29,860
center of the retina the four Ferrara is

62
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:32,378
what produces the sharpest image the

63
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,180
Fabra is the area that's producing that

64
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:36,310
sharpest image you want that focused on

65
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,049
the back of the eye is that's what's

66
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,780
going to allow the image to be perceived

67
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:44,049
in its clearest form now rods are very

68
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,419
sensitive to dim light as we see here

69
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,909
are they connected Singlish colors nor

70
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:52,030
can they detect the edges of images they

71
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,949
produce a poorly defined image in

72
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,959
contrast so that cones can take color

73
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:59,409
and they're able to detect edges well

74
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,569
may help produce very sharp images rods

75
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,759
and cones both of these are located at

76
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:07,208
the rear of the retina not the front

77
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,828
because this is where our image will be

78
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,930
focused if it was in the front as her

79
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,379
own lenses that image then gets

80
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,390
projected in the back now color vision

81
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:18,009
there's three kinds of cones that exist

82
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,469
each absorb different wavelengths of

83
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:23,019
light we have our blue our green and our

84
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:25,840
red so despite only having three cones

85
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,599
were able to perceive many different

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,879
colors so these many different colors

87
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,489
were able to perceive as a combination

88
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,680
or a blending of what these cones are

89
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,780
receiving we said evident here with our

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,290
red in our green when they mix together

91
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,090
they form yellow now if you mix red

92
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:45,729
green and blue we get that white light

93
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,469
event in here and a combination of these

94
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:50,289
it shows kind of the distinctive colors

95
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:52,750
here or how I able to get these general

96
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:54,699
wavelengths of light and this is how

97
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,789
were able to perceive all of these

98
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,348
variations of colors now if you didn't

99
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:01,209
see any colors there you might be color

100
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:04,689
blind which is a condition where a

101
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,699
person cannot see all three colors it's

102
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:09,489
caused by a lack of one or more types of

103
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:12,189
cones it's inherited as a six-link trait

104
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,169
is more likely to affect males because

105
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:18,848
it's an x-linked recessive inheritance

106
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:22,689
rate one in 12 men will be affected an

107
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:25,060
average and one in 200 women be affected

108
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:26,379
by color blindness if you see here if

109
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,730
you see just a bunch of dots you might

110
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:34,060
be color blind

111
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:37,420
sheis 74 here so the 74 I was a number

112
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,250
for this colorblind test now continuing

113
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,259
on at the eye were focusing for distant

114
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,959
vision we're looking in the distance for

115
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,819
things light from a distance needs very

116
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,189
little adjusting for proper focusing

117
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,689
Farpoint vision the distance beyond

118
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,480
which the lens does not need to change

119
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,100
shape to focus is about 20 feet closer

120
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,970
than 20 feet we call that close vision

121
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,550
in the closer source as the light is

122
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,470
bent more sharply by the relaxed lens to

123
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,480
strike the retina so we see both of

124
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,820
these striking two distinctive back of

125
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,310
the retina here for distant vision our

126
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,050
lens is very flat for close vision our

127
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,180
muscles have adjusted to cause that lens

128
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,980
to be fatter bending that light so that

129
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,490
it directly hits the back of our retina

130
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,310
for clear image I'll focus in for closed

131
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,259
vision we have a combination which is

132
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,180
the change in the lens shaped by ciliary

133
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,000
muscles to decrease this factory power

134
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,340
we see that here see that fattening of

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,980
the lens causing again that focus point

136
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,479
to be directly on the retina

137
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,520
constriction is the patellar reflex

138
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,230
constricts the pupils to prevent

139
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,629
divergent light rays from entering the

140
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,100
eye if you've ever had your eyes dilated

141
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,569
after going to the eye doctor if this is

142
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,360
what it all looks like pupils will

143
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:49,300
dilate and this isn't I here that did

144
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,160
not have people dilation convergence is

145
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,230
the medial rotation the eyeballs towards

146
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,090
the object being viewed this is kind of

147
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,569
a distinctive case here what this person

148
00:05:55,089 --> 00:06:00,759
is able to independently move one eye

149
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:02,949
compared to the other but to focus on a

150
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,969
closed object both eyeballs are going to

151
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,289
converge to that midpoint their problems

152
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,080
with refraction so if you wear glasses

153
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,030
this is important to you if you have

154
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,240
normal vision that's with the light

155
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:18,939
focus properly nearsighted myopic is the

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,620
focal point is in front of the retina so

157
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:23,860
we see here is evident of

158
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,220
nearsightedness that focal point is is

159
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,620
in front of the retina that means that

160
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,250
when the image does hit the retina it's

161
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,590
blurry

162
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,329
how does that look well you see here is

163
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:36,939
a clear image and here's kind of the

164
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:39,579
mirror objects being a little bit better

165
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:41,288
in focus and those just slightly further

166
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:43,478
away here

167
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:46,658
not having quite as distinctive kind of

168
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:49,538
sharpness to that image farsightedness

169
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:51,968
the focal point is beyond the retina and

170
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:53,110
corrective lenses with a different type

171
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:55,028
of lens we see here

172
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,669
so as a focal points behind the retina

173
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:58,930
we see that here in the king the image

174
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,778
here is still blurry

175
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,588
these are corrected farsightedness with

176
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:06,999
a convex lens see here in

177
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:09,278
nearsightedness there's a concave lens

178
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:12,039
and that's adjusting so that in both

179
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:15,430
cases now the focal point is directly on

180
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:17,019
the retina Epsilon's is found in glasses

181
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,360
there's a bunch of different types more

182
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,139
than just for near and farsightedness

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,759
depending on your vision you may have

184
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,908
multiple lenses in your glasses to help

185
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,199
with both near and far focus bifocals as

186
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:27,998
the name implies there's two different

187
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,009
types of lenses we have one for far

188
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,729
typically locators the top of the lens

189
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:35,229
in near for the bottom portion trifocals

190
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:38,318
this name implies there's three there's

191
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:40,149
a far or middle in an ear there's also

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,699
progressive lenses they've changed

193
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:44,709
magnifying power near to the middle to

194
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,870
far vision and gradually they don't have

195
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:49,120
these distinctive lines as a trifocal or

196
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,309
a bifocal would have in general their

197
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,439
purpose is the same to help the

198
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:55,379
individuals see clearer this is the

199
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:59,379
image of Seattle being refracted through

200
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:01,838
myopic glasses their binocular vision

201
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,269
primates and most predators have eyes in

202
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:06,129
front of the head the two fields of

203
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:08,829
vision overlap allowing the perception

204
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:10,569
of 3d images in depth prey animals

205
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:12,609
generally have eyes located on the sides

206
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,709
of their head this prevents binocular

207
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,269
vision but enlarges the perceptive field

208
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,939
of view you see that here with our

209
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:20,199
pigeon these pigeons have a very large

210
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,499
field of view because they're often

211
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,330
preyed on owls are predators and they

212
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:28,809
have not quite as larger field of view

213
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:31,868
more overlap more of a blind spot will

214
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:33,819
say these are more focused in these two

215
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:35,889
fields that overlap the line perception

216
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:38,379
of 3d images in depth you ever want to

217
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,629
try this you take both of your hands and

218
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,519
put them out in front of you and go

219
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:44,948
through and touch the tips of your

220
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,620
fingers but then if you close just one

221
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:50,438
eye and try to do it you'll often miss

222
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,839
because you lack that 3d depth

223
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:54,578
perception

224
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,130
lastly some animals chameleons in

225
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,959
particular

226
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:59,480
here can move each eye independently

227
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,570
this can allow for a greater field of

228
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,789
view they can focus both eyes and select

229
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,700
prey before striking so this is another

230
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:09,589
kind of unique adaptation that some

231
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,020
animals have four independent eye

232
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,060
movement hopefully this is helpful in

233
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,090
giving you that brief overview about the

234
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,089
eye
