1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,990
humor provide a brief overview of what's

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,400
called cation exchange capacity or CEC

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,230
needed to Inchon the exact of the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,330
details of the chemistry of the

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,309
interaction here whatever basic

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,870
understanding is come this is something

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,050
very commonly provided in soil test

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,419
engross didn't have questions about this

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,699
so cation exchange capacity or as I said

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,560
is abbreviated CEC this is the measure

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,050
of the soils ability to hold positively

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,118
charged ions those are important we see

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,700
the positive charged ions mentioned here

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:36,509
are a lot that are associated with major

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,489
nutrients needed by the plants the CEC

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,988
influences the soils ability to hold on

17
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:43,558
to essential nutrients and provide a

18
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:45,359
buffer against soil acidification so we

19
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,968
see that the soil particle here is that

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,710
typical permanent negative charge and

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,770
that's going to attract or hold these

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,530
positive ions which tend to have a lot

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,910
of nutrients that the plants need so

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,009
first off that cation that I'd mentioned

25
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:01,229
lesson Adam with a positive charge

26
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,358
it means it's lost an electron so we go

27
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,609
back to hydrogen atom here one proton

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,189
one electron protons have a positive

29
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,829
charge electrons have a negative charge

30
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:12,750
so if it's a cation that means it's lost

31
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,329
an electron in this case it loses an

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,759
electron called becomes oxidized or this

33
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,759
becomes now positive ion which would be

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,709
properly termed cation in contrast to

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,478
that atoms a negative charge it is an

36
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,158
anion so here we're gaining another

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,618
electron electrons have a negative

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,600
charge it's being reduced and we have

39
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,478
the hydrogen and ion here

40
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,908
so anion negatively charged cation

41
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,069
positively charged since this is cation

42
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,460
exchange capacity its ability for soils

43
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:43,258
to exchange positive ions some of those

44
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,059
base cation so you mentioned the

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,899
important nutrients such as calcium

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,609
magnesium sodium and potassium these are

47
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,070
all involved in those cations that are

48
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:56,399
interacting with roots in the negatively

49
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:59,069
charged soil particles what influences

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,159
CSC the soils with higher clay fraction

51
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,769
can have higher CC organic matter also

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,320
has high CC so you're looking at just

53
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,060
increasing CC well for an organic matter

54
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,579
in clean materials well that's just

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,949
naturally gonna increase that CC you can

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,380
see here in contrast sand is a very low

57
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,848
CEC I'm so just again something to keep

58
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,098
in mind if you are growing the same

59
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:21,869
medium that your CC naturally is it's

60
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:25,500
going to be lower by the inherent

61
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,480
particle size solo CC what is this cause

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,879
well soil is comely sanding in texture

63
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,488
with low CEC are more likely to develop

64
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,009
deficiencies in potassium and magnesium

65
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,560
as well as other cations and having that

66
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:39,689
low cation exchange doesn't allow this

67
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,219
to be held very well it's not a plant to

68
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,139
be able to tape them up so some of the

69
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:47,030
drawbacks to have the CC see the

70
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,029
nutrient deficiencies can incur
