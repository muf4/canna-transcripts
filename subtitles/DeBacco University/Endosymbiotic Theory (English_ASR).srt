1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,490
okay so here I want to provide a brief

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,599
overview of the endosymbiotic theory and

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,059
how this kind of came about

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,849
if you look here this what is the

5
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:14,308
endosymbiotic theory well it's a

6
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:17,399
hypothesized origin for eukaryotic cells

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:19,858
how do we get cells that have kind of

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,409
membrane bound organelles well looking

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,210
here we have a prokaryotic cell and

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,210
there's a potential that cell membrane

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,039
in foldings could have occurred these in

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,170
foldings can create little pockets in

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,329
these ultimately could have led to the

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,239
development and specialization of

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,250
different organelles now two organelles

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,939
in particular for docking plant salesmen

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,219
for sure are very complex they're the

18
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,659
mitochondria and the chloroplasts we're

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,520
talking animal cells reducing at the

20
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,369
mitochondria now mitochondria

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,129
chloroplasts are very complex a very

22
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,448
unique structure so odds are that they

23
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,878
probably just didn't come from in

24
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:58,649
membrane foldings the theory behind how

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,079
they became incorporated into cell

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,299
looking first at the mitochondria with

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,150
this aerobic oxygen using proto

28
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,399
bacterium enters the eukaryotic cell it

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,859
could be either as a prey item or a

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,170
parasite and it manages to avoid

31
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:15,539
digestion or being broken down so that's

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,490
an important component there exactly how

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,900
it avoids that not really sure if

34
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,149
there's other theories regarding that

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,430
but it's taken into the cell and is not

36
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,520
broken down then it becomes kind of an

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,350
endosymbiotic and that's we get the term

38
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,019
endosymbiotic theory endo meaning inside

39
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:34,289
the cell somatic means both gaining a

40
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:36,239
benefit here so this poor bacterium that

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,450
is generating its own energy using

42
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,489
oxygen is incorporated into the cell so

43
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,129
the cell has this advantage of this

44
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,929
energy producing organelle proto

45
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,390
bacterium gains the advantage of being

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,780
protected within this cell so again

47
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,399
they're both receiving a benefit there

48
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,739
now chloroplast for docking plant cells

49
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,930
also very complex how did they kind of

50
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,368
get incorporated into into cells there

51
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,140
well as we'll see in a moment

52
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:03,629
chloroplasts have a lot of resemblance

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,359
to say in a bacterium so this is a

54
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,368
potential way that they could have been

55
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,469
taking in again not digested not broken

56
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,449
down and incorporated as part of the

57
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,560
cell now both the mitochondria in

58
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,989
chloroplasts

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,939
contained their own while small

60
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,189
percentage still their own DNA that

61
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,259
isn't found in the nucleus so this

62
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,000
further supports the idea or the theory

63
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,679
that they may have once been free living

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,800
because they do have their own unique

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,900
DNA so if we're looking at that kind of

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,969
comparison between our chloroplast and

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,730
our Co bacterium this just kind of shows

68
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,889
you some of the similarities that do

69
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:40,259
exist in their structures because see

70
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,089
the outer membranes present in both

71
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,439
intermembrane present both nuclei

72
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,939
present in both again that's kind of

73
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:50,879
that DNA component there thylakoids

74
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:53,609
ribosomes in both now there are some you

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,849
know unique components to each because

76
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,580
they are different at this point but the

77
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,199
high degree of similarities indicates

78
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,969
that they may have at one time than a

79
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,099
free-living and then some of them may

80
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,349
have been incorporated into cells for

81
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,359
the mutual benefit of again getting

82
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,909
protection the cell getting a way to

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
generate energy in this case capturing

84
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:18,259
the sunlight the light energy and

85
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,259
converting it into chemical energy
