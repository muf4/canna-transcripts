00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
in this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,720
looking at potassium

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,120
as related to a soil test report and why

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:17,919
it's important to watch and monitor your

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:17,920
potassium levels

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,920
so potassium typically called potash is

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,160
important we're looking at your soil

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,000
test report however when i say soil test

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,399
report we're typically not testing these

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
little

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,399
homeowner kits here we're getting it

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
tested at a professional lab and basing

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
our results off that

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,558
so plant potassium requirements so when

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,199
we're looking at our plants we do

16
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,000
require

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
large amounts of potassium and elemental

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,960
symbol k

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
potassium is released from rocks and

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,120
soil minerals as they weather

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,399
often the supply of potassium from the

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,599
soil is limited

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,280
and inputs of this nutrient are required

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,679
simply because there might be potassium

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,799
present but typically not the levels

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,640
that were required by plants

27
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,118
so what are the potassium functions

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
within that plant why is it so important

29
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,959
well potassium is critical for numerous

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
plant functions and especially aids and

31
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,719
hardiness

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
and potential for disease resistance and

33
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,319
also we can see for increased root

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,759
growth we see potassium building and

35
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,599
strengthening the plant

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,359
water status for growing fruits it can

37
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,158
be in that actual fleshy component of

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,840
the fruits

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,280
so there's a lot of functions for

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,960
potassium in the plants

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,799
this is why it's typically needed in

42
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,798
large amounts

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,000
now when we're adding potassium

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,600
fertilizer

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,118
we want to look at the timing of that

46
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,118
potassium fertilizer

47
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,159
so typically plants need potassium more

48
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,400
in the second half

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
of the grow cycle so growers should add

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
fertilizer to best

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,840
match this if all the fertilizer is

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
provided at the time of planting

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
this can increase the odds of

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,920
deficiencies later in the growing season

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
and also increase the chance that the

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
potassium added will be leached

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
and kind of wasted to potentially become

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
a contaminant to the local environment

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
so when we're looking at that kind of

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,759
days after planting and that kind of

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,359
when's potassium going to be needed

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,879
we're going to be looking at that later

63
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,560
portion here

64
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,919
that potassium uptake would be needed so

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,199
if we fertilize everything here in the

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,519
first 30 days

67
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,238
well the total amount needed not really

68
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
that much

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
much later in the season needed in

70
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,598
greater amounts so again

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
good time to fertilize in this example

72
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,959
here looking at the graph

73
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,878
would be about that 30 to 40 days or so

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,560
assuming there's some levels in the soil

75
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,280
and to allow for that

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
really high demand phase to be when the

77
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
potassium is

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,159
most available so how do we spot a

79
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,760
potassium

80
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,359
deficiency potentially and it's going to

81
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,679
look like this in many crops

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,519
but potassium can move within the plant

83
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,239
so deficiencies are likely to show in

84
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,039
the older

85
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,360
leaves first it typically expresses

86
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,598
itself as a yelling of the leaf margins

87
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
or

88
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,719
edges of the leaves we can clearly see

89
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,479
that here

90
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,039
and also to a less extent but still

91
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,759
prevalent here on the leaf margins here

92
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,359
as well

93
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,039
so that's how you would spot potassium

94
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
deficiency but hopefully you catch it

95
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,919
early enough

96
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,680
where if you don't get into this

97
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,079
situation but if you are starting to see

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,439
this

99
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
you might want to check your potassium

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,598
levels because likely

101
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,239
they're going to be deficient in that

102
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,238
nutrient
