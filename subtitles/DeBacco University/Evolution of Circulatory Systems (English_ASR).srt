1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
okay here we're going to cut the

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:07,108
evolution of circulatory systems we're

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,120
going to go from a very basic here with

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:12,809
basically like a flatworm to very

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,669
complex system like our own now one of

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,108
the first evolutionary steps here was

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,289
the development of a gastrovascular

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,660
cavity cnidarians and flat worms have a

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,359
cavity that both function for digestion

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,829
as well as circulation so while they do

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,230
have a strictly tation circulatory

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,839
system they also kind of overlap here

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,460
with a digestive system so this is why

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,789
these are considered our most primitive

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,799
of organisms building from that we then

16
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,210
have organisms like this that have

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,179
developed what we call an open

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,939
circulatory system now what this entails

19
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,189
is there is no distinction between

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,849
circulating fluid such as blood and

21
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:52,259
fluid of body tissues which is limp

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,239
hemolymph is what it specifically

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,549
referred to as so there's kind of this

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,948
mixture here in these open circulatory

25
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,439
systems as such as our mollusk here for

26
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:04,378
example of the snail and arthropods is

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,319
RB below these open circulatory systems

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,000
the fluid called chemo lump is pumped

29
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,399
through blood vessels that empties into

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,920
the body cavity the human lymph returns

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,659
to blood vessels through openings now

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,728
what makes this so primitive

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,228
you may think oh just pumping blood and

34
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,599
lymph around well I'll just kind of

35
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,150
going into a category there's not really

36
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,759
like a very controlled or specific

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,530
system that's being pumped through see

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,799
here we have multiple hearts we're

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,780
having this kind of mix mixtures here us

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,520
Austria here are the openings and you

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,469
can see if there's many of them it's not

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,868
just one and this is why it's kind of

43
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,879
open because blood can flow to here to

44
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:45,060
here to come around here it's not very

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,920
organized closed circulatory systems

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,019
such as annelids in vertebrates they

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,599
have circulating fluid blood is always

48
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,149
been closed within vessels that's the

49
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,669
definition that's what makes it closed

50
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,710
this transports blood away from and back

51
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,509
to a pump in this case being the heart

52
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,819
you have our example here of our

53
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,569
earthworm these closed circulatory

54
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,000
systems

55
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:08,008
pictured in both of these images here

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,348
the heart pumps blood through vesicles

57
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,299
that's separate from the interstitial

58
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,889
fluid of the body so it's not only

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,260
organized with the vessel

60
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,179
but there's also a separation most

61
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,219
vertebrates and some invertebrates such

62
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,340
as the inlet earthworm as I pictured

63
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,680
here have any a closed circulatory

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,990
system now what these kind of blood

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,750
vessels look like and a more detailed

66
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,850
set such as verbs birds and mammals they

67
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,229
have a heart which is the pump blood

68
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,479
vessels which are the networks of tubes

69
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:40,310
then blood is the actual circulating

70
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:43,219
fluid now specifically we refer to these

71
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,379
vesicles that we have summons arteries

72
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:48,989
arteries carry blood away they away from

73
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:51,299
the heart veins return blood to the

74
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,420
heart and capillaries connect these to

75
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,340
us these areas we're having exchange of

76
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:58,889
nutrients and or oxygen in carbon

77
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,620
dioxide blood plasma passes through the

78
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:03,359
capillaries pressure forces the fluid at

79
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,610
the capillary walls some of this

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,890
interstitial fluid returns back to the

81
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,720
capillaries and Sembilan pencils are

82
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,488
returned to the venous blood and

83
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,639
specific sites so you kind of this

84
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,159
distinction between the lymph system in

85
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,559
our exact circulatory system even though

86
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,039
both do kind of work in cohort with one

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,750
another

88
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,609
so hopefully this gives you a little bit

89
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,680
of the timeline and different

90
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,130
complexities related to circulatory

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,129
systems
