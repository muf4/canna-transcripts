1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
okay here we're gonna look at how your

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,588
body goes about regulating blood calcium

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,879
levels so let's start with homeostasis

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,638
what does your body want to maintain

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,490
well normal calcium levels are ten

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,528
milligrams per dekaliter it's normal

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,179
calcium levels so your body's trying to

8
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:23,160
keep on a very consistent rate despite a

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,278
lot of changes so how does your body

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,980
regulate this well first off if we have

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:32,789
an increase in our calcium level say

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,159
plus ten milligrams per liter nothing at

13
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,320
higher than that the thyroid is gonna

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,479
release calcitonin which is going to

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,579
cause calcium reabsorption in the

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,269
kidneys to decrease which is going to

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,980
limit our osteoclast activity and this

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,170
ultimately is going to lead to the

19
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,959
calcium levels and blood to decrease

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,059
back down to ten so here we're seeing an

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,609
above ten we're seeing these chaining of

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:59,070
events that occur reducing the level so

23
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,780
then get it back around ten now the

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,210
opposite occurs we have a decrease in

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,239
calcium level the parathyroid glands

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,010
release PTH which is a hormone this will

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,798
cause osteoclasts to release calcium

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,049
from bone calcium is reabsorbed from the

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,390
urine by the kidneys and calcium

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,450
absorption and small intestine increases

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,368
v via vitamin D synthesis these three

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,439
events will cause calcium levels in the

33
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:24,688
blood to increase hopefully bringing

34
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,329
that level back up to the ten milligrams

35
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,889
particularly to that your body needs

36
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,868
this is a general overview we look at

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,759
this now in a little bit more detail so

38
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,170
this is kind of putting it all together

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,269
it's you're trying to maintain

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,478
homeostasis there's way to increase it

41
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:41,519
we want to if calcium levels increase we

42
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,078
want to lower them if they decrease we

43
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,719
want to raise them to help maintain

44
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,069
homeostasis now look at this a little

45
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,469
bit more detail we have blood calcium

46
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,449
concentration dropping so we kind of

47
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,890
have this kind of situation it's

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,859
occurring here is this decrease in

49
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,210
calcium level that's initially occurring

50
00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:00,659
now looking to some more detail the body

51
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:03,569
study this is a PTH which is that

52
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,759
parathyroid gland hormone and that's

53
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:08,848
being released into the bloodstream

54
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,378
that's causing an effect on the bone it

55
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,500
inhibits the osteoblasts

56
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:15,030
to missy osteo class bone is broken

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,849
releasing calcium ions into the

58
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,530
bloodstream this same hormone now in

59
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,259
addition to the blood also is affecting

60
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,240
the kidneys it's doing the kidneys to

61
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,009
recover wastes calcium doesn't want to

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,100
excrete that it wants to take that back

63
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:32,849
into the bloodstream this is causing

64
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,919
that movement of these ions to help

65
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,319
raise these levels up clear this initial

66
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,229
drop that your body's able to sense in

67
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,340
addition to the bone and the kidneys the

68
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:44,759
intestines will also be affected

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,770
these PTH hormone will also stimulate

70
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,929
the intestines to absorb calcium from

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,610
digesting the food this is important

72
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,340
because your body's doing whatever it

73
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,250
can help bring these levels up now

74
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,979
calcium levels will begin to increase

75
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,650
this may cause calcitonin to be released

76
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,530
high concentrations of calcium stimulate

77
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,300
these cells to release calcitonin castle

78
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,479
tone will put calcium into bone so in

79
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,890
this case we had low levels we did these

80
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,149
three different events we've now

81
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,809
increased our blood calcium levels

82
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,789
almost too high now we need to reabsorb

83
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,370
that and store that calcium in the sense

84
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:23,879
of calcitonin that then will ultimately

85
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,439
release with to the calcitonin in the

86
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,810
bone which is to make the osteoblasts

87
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,759
inhibit the osteoclasts and calcium is

88
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,759
ultimately removed from the blood and

89
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,649
used to build bone and then that can

90
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,149
cause the calcium levels to drop which

91
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,430
will then cause the sequence of events

92
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,890
to occur so just want to understand that

93
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,379
it's very complex and how the body does

94
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,238
regulate in this case just calcium but

95
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,479
there is always a way to in this case

96
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,060
raise our calcium levels and decrease

97
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,399
our calcium levels to help maintain that

98
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,180
very delicate balance we call

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,180
homeostasis
