1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
so here we're looking at comparing

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,099
coevolution in co-adaptation we see this

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,689
image here of this flower selecting for

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,759
a very specific pollinator or in this

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,250
case an insect so how are these kind of

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,469
coal valve and Co adapting together to

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,300
allow this perfect match to occur this

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,489
flower for whatever reason may want only

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,859
this particular type of insect to carry

10
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,679
its pollen so what's occurring between

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,460
these two species to allow this very

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,528
high degree of specificity so

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,539
coevolution is a term that describes the

14
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,939
long term evolutionary adjustments of a

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,219
species to one another this coevolution

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,109
is two or more species that exert

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,050
selective pressures on each other and

18
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:45,628
evolve in response to each other we see

19
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,788
a prime example of that here where these

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,189
flowers are a very small light a minor

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,929
and are very long which matches up

22
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,628
perfectly with the hummingbirds long

23
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,509
beak a bee would not be a great

24
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:00,420
pollinator for this but it's this flower

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,460
is designing its structures to

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,690
particularly match that of the

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,599
hummingbird

28
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,789
- coevolution to occur because each

29
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,519
species is evolved in response to the

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,469
other one important feature of evolution

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,019
is that the selective environment is

32
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:19,798
constantly changing to allow this to

33
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,780
occur over a long period of time now how

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,420
do we study coevolution alcoa Lucian

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,700
setting many levels adaptations of the

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,090
individual's interactions between

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,270
species and also broad evolutionary

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,420
patterns co-adaptation is the reciprocal

39
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,099
adaptations of two species this could

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,079
refer to species it could reach also

41
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:43,078
refer to adaptations possessed by

42
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:46,048
individuals and/or their genotypes and

43
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,879
so on so if you look at an example of

44
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,299
co-adaptation we have caterpillars that

45
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,459
are secreting honeydew for ants to drink

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,159
well why would they do this

47
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,709
well ants will go out of their way to

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,590
defend caterpillars against parasitic

49
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:03,599
wasps which can kill the caterpillars so

50
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,359
the honeydew secretion and defense are

51
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,250
Co adaptations the honeydew that is

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,030
supplied to the ants by the caterpillars

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,960
will allow or provide the caterpillars

54
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,640
with

55
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,219
physical protection from the ants from

56
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,039
parasitic wasps that can lay egg and

57
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:23,460
literally cause the caterpillar to die

58
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:26,370
this is an example of a co-adaptation

59
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,570
that's occurring so how this

60
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,409
co-adaptation and demonstrate

61
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,269
coevolution

62
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,609
well biologists often have a strict

63
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,430
definition for coevolution it's evidence

64
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,640
of parallel evolution between taxa which

65
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,360
is referred to broad definition or

66
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,539
classification is required so this does

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,600
co-adaptation demonstrate coevolution

68
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:50,609
adaptation is in the short term and

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,409
evolution is over the long term and here

70
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,840
we have different animal species

71
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,840
exhibiting different wings for flight
