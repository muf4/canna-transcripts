1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
here we're looking at cloning with the

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,508
easy clone which is a commercially

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,540
available product in this case isn't the

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,419
easy clone low pro 64 meaning that it

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:15,119
will clone up to 64 cuttings at one time

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,160
it's a form of aeroponic propagation

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,769
here and we'll go through just some of

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,240
the basics of this so some growers have

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,640
a love-hate relationship with the ez

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,618
clone it can be very efficient put in

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,000
quotes here it can be the best system if

12
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,698
there's attention to detail by the

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,099
grower so some people see this easy

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,500
clone is just too intricate too much

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,839
detail kind of like these small gears

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,308
and a watch here and too difficult to

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,870
figure out so I'm here to shed some

18
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:42,780
light on what it takes to actually use

19
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,909
this properly the key part is to

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,230
optimize the EZ clean conditions with pH

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,089
being the first priority

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,488
knowing the pH you maintaining is very

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,140
important if the pH is not monitored

24
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,659
this is typically result of poor to

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,929
non-existent routing example here at pH

26
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,640
of 4.96 I'll be much too acidic and this

27
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,960
would lead to poor routing so I think

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,579
this is where a lot of people go wrong

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,219
with the EZ clone is they're just not

30
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,099
monitoring or aware of what the pH is in

31
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,469
the environment on managing heat is

32
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,089
another issue so location cloners this

33
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,310
place can contribute to the reservoir

34
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,890
heat this is the pump water pump that's

35
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,329
used in the spray bar this pump also

36
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,489
does generate some heat so that's

37
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,989
important to keep in mind well let a

38
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,089
slightly warmer water temp is

39
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,649
advantageous but only to a certain point

40
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,060
so it's good that there's a little heat

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,890
generated but if it's earning a warm

42
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,450
environment that could cause some issues

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,820
here

44
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,829
an area that may only have bottom heat

45
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,239
or only exacerbate the problem so you

46
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,798
want to just be mindful of the area

47
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,890
putting it in knowing that this pump

48
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,049
will still produce a little bit of heat

49
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,909
blue labs blue lab guardian monitor here

50
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,740
is a great all-in-one tool you can

51
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,780
monitor the EC which is to dissolve

52
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,789
solids in this case abbott in

53
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,200
parts-per-million you can also monitor

54
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,350
this temperature and go from Fahrenheit

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,450
or Celsius also the pH here this can

56
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,919
also there's options to be linked to

57
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,409
remote devices you don't have to be

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,439
present to watch it this is a standalone

59
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,060
unit in the image here look to add to

60
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,128
the reservoir so plain water can work

61
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,469
nutrient solutions can also help speed

62
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,479
up the routing to popular products are

63
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,090
the clinic's solution pictured here and

64
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,189
also Olivia's solution

65
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,439
now which would in solution to use or

66
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,389
I've run trials on both when the clinic

67
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,099
takes an extra day or so to route in

68
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:24,208
comparison to the Olivia's leave it does

69
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,729
read quickest

70
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,469
however the clinics is pH stable while

71
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,959
Olivia's does require almost daily

72
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,629
attention to monitor and maintain a

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,069
proper pH clone X based on the

74
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,259
recommended used by the manufacturer

75
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,689
does cost less well this is slightly

76
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,250
more expensive clone X does produce a

77
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,620
clean solution that's very pump and

78
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,479
filter friendly well while the Olivia's

79
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,280
does have left over a particulate which

80
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,859
can clog a filter if you use it over

81
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,669
time and don't take that step of

82
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,380
cleaning that on a regular schedule we

83
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,879
do control an easy clone so it can run

84
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,189
without extra Committee added which is

85
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,629
great this is if the lighting is not too

86
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,759
intense in the heat is kept to a minimum

87
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,250
so in certain instances it may be

88
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,539
unnecessary to kind of add some misting

89
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,759
system if it's already in the warm

90
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,199
environment but watch the amount and

91
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,459
size of the water droplets you use

92
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,229
because it is possibly to

93
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,209
unintentionally over fill the reservoir

94
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,189
stopping the continual water spray of

95
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,739
the aeroponics that's needed to keep

96
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,269
that rooting environment going this is

97
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,370
why you see examples here the plastic

98
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,049
bag over and help water sheet away and

99
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,349
not get caught in the cloner and over

100
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:30,239
filling it this is just a result of the

101
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,709
environment that was placed in again

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,239
want to eliminate water from

103
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,920
unintentionally being entered but if

104
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,980
you're not adding extra humidity or mist

105
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,629
this shouldn't be a problem how long she

106
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,609
believes your cuttings in the cloner

107
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,139
well you want to see till the roots

108
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,910
emerge while plants can grow in the

109
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,679
system once roots are about the width of

110
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:48,329
the supporting foam they should be

111
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,829
removed so at this point this would be a

112
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,209
great time to remove these cuttings

113
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,950
sometimes you'll also in that route

114
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,120
earlier and some that route later the

115
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,759
advantage of this system that you can

116
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,420
remove individual clones when you feel

117
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,219
already lastly the basic setup while

118
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,599
this is in a greenhouse since cuttings

119
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,060
do not need full Sun this is not a

120
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,009
requirement on missing system this

121
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,299
misting bar here was used as the heat

122
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,039
this is a greenhouse

123
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,870
but also notice that the electrical

124
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,328
outlets locate up here and the monitor

125
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,918
are kept above than this bar keeping

126
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,959
them out of this high mist environment

127
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,759
and only keeping the cloner in that

128
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,108
misting environment here to eliminate

129
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,108
the stress on the seedlings
