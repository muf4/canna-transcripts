1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
okay here we're investigating some of

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,440
the pros and cons to cloning cannabis

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,789
plants so starting off with cloning

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,219
cannabis this is a vegetative

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:13,138
propagation process clones are

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,209
genetically identical to their parent or

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,769
mother plants also sometimes called the

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,410
stock plant this helps ensure

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,118
consistency and gender of the offspring

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,329
it's like the clone army in Star Wars

11
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,800
we're generating identical copies and

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,659
the benefits of cloning the goals

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,359
produced many identical copies of a

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,099
chosen individual this preserves the

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,929
chosen or desirable traits

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,659
unlike seeds that produce a high degree

17
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,460
of variability this ensures only female

18
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,828
plants are produced so only we won't be

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,539
wasting their times with the males so

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,219
that we're only getting the buds and

21
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,409
cannabinoid production that's very high

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,558
as a result this is a very efficient

23
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,509
production method then only in the sense

24
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,549
of the end product but also the process

25
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,899
to generate them in Lewis it needs two

26
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,939
sex plants because you're guaranteed

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,079
that they'll all be female and as long

28
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,759
as you're starting with a female plant

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,049
then they can be planted as soon as the

30
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,509
roots develop there's not a lot of lag

31
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,099
time in that seedling stage the time the

32
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,228
harvest can be reduced when compared

33
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,579
with the initial seedling delay when

34
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,379
starting with seed so you're not only

35
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,519
improving your time efficiency but

36
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,759
you're kind of making this a nice

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,489
repeatable process there are the

38
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,759
drawbacks that for all clones have or

39
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:22,890
lack resistance to disease so it can

40
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,989
it's possible to lose an entire crop due

41
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,478
to the lack of variability for the

42
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,679
example here of bananas the Cavendish

43
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,890
bananas that we're all familiar with

44
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,439
eating are very susceptible to a

45
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,879
Fusarium disease as a result since

46
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,828
they're all clones bananas are actually

47
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,390
clones of one another once the disease

48
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,339
figures one out it's able to kind of

49
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,340
spread in this Domino like effect and

50
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,960
wipe out potentially an entire crop and

51
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,460
see that here with this plants resistant

52
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,618
this plants not well if we were cloning

53
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,239
this plant all of the offspring would

54
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,430
also not be resistant to the particular

55
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,269
disease and as a result we could lose

56
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,430
them he cloning for sex so as this mean

57
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,849
well Suzie Vaughn to clone infer whether

58
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,759
that male or female plant but this does

59
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:07,530
this involve taking a clone early from a

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,628
plant and placing it in that 12 hours of

61
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,939
light and 12 hours of dark period this

62
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,199
will induce flowering very quickly this

63
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,199
will help you determine if it's a male

64
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,569
or female

65
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,280
earlier in development and can allow you

66
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,870
to make an educated decision whether you

67
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,539
going to keep or discard of that plant

68
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,189
the key is to label each plant ax to

69
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:26,319
take these cuttings from and where the

70
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,629
cuttings are going for accurate for

71
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,209
accuracy however PCR polymerase chain

72
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,430
reaction has made this obsolete for

73
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,920
large-scale growers however this can be

74
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,290
an expensive process some there's a way

75
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,179
to reduce cost or it is simply taking a

76
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:42,699
small clone from a plant that they grew

77
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,650
from seed flipping it to 12 hours a day

78
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:46,659
12 hours night to see what types of

79
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,189
flowers it produces and then deciding

80
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:51,180
whether or not going to keep or discard

81
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,180
that individual
