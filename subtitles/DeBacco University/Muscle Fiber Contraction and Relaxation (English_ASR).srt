1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,430
okay this is gonna go over muscle fiber

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,990
contraction and relaxation so we have a

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:08,609
contraction is what's going on here

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,550
we're bringing all our muscles together

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,919
and relaxation is kind of the opposite

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,080
effect of that now while this is gonna

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,118
focus on what happens for the muscle

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,500
fiber they're gonna be if you haven't

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,899
had exposure a little bit of an

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,198
introductory to the nervous system and

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,788
how neurons interact so I'm going to go

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,010
through this process and I'm gonna kind

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,269
of build on the images here so you're

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,920
welcome to pause the video and read

15
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,619
what's here I'm gonna try to help

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,689
explain this so starting with a muscle

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,419
fiber contraction sequence it's a series

18
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:42,209
of steps here looking at step one here

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,760
the neurotransmitter ACH which is

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,289
acetylcholine is released from the axon

21
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,589
terminal binds to receptors on the

22
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:54,600
sarcolemma

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:57,210
now what's going on here so our axon

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,359
which is our nervous system is releasing

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,948
a neurotransmitter and it's binding so

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,960
keep in mind our proteins it be very

27
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:05,879
specific binding that's occurring and

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,760
that's what what's worth noticing here

29
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:12,149
you may remember if you can err system

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,609
before this gap here is called a synapse

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,310
so we have our neurotransmitter being

32
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,530
released and binding here so as see the

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,868
Cullens being released and binding to

34
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,299
the receptors here since so far this is

35
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:28,650
what's occurring building on from that

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:31,320
the action potential is generated and

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,109
travels down the t-tubule so this

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,089
binding that occurs is now during an

39
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,840
action potential and it's traveling

40
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,689
along this structure called a t2 beulah

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,859
so again here's our axon we're going

42
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:45,989
through we're releasing our

43
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,478
neurotransmitter binding to the proteins

44
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,969
here and now this signal this action

45
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,868
potential signal is being transmitted to

46
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,489
a structure called the t-tubule

47
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:59,218
calcium ions now are very important in

48
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:01,709
this process so calcium ions here are

49
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:05,339
released from storage in the

50
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:07,828
sarcoplasmic reticulum predated sr in

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,330
response to the change in voltage so we

52
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,348
said that action potential comes here

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,790
down the t-tubule

54
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,219
well now that we have that voltage

55
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,259
change calcium is being

56
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,889
the calcium is typically related with

57
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:22,109
this +2 charge that's the charge that it

58
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,969
takes on and that's being released here

59
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,790
we see the same thing going on in this

60
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:28,259
image where we have the binding of the

61
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,669
neurotransmitter we have the change in

62
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,810
voltage and now we have a release of

63
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:36,209
calcium so the calcium binds to troponin

64
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,670
this cross bridge is formed between

65
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,909
actin and myosin resulting in a muscle

66
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:44,250
contraction so here's our actin thin

67
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,979
filaments and here's our myosin as long

68
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,639
as calcium ions remain in the sarcoplasm

69
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:52,829
to bind to troponin as long as ATP is

70
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,109
available long as these two conditions

71
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,570
in do exist the muscle fiber will

72
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,950
continue to shorten and what that is is

73
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,079
that slight filament we have our muscle

74
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,609
contracting a muscle can stop

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,300
contracting though when it either runs

76
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,430
out of ATP and/or becomes fatigued now

77
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,050
the video on the sliding filament theory

78
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,480
which we'll go over some more of this in

79
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,080
greater detail but that calcium ion

80
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,609
release we notice that release is

81
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,969
causing the sarcoplasm to bind to

82
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,950
troponin as ATP is available our muscle

83
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,629
fiber will go from this stage and it

84
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,539
will shorten to the sliding filaments

85
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:30,419
and it will result in this on the shape

86
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,889
here cause a contraction to occur now

87
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,429
keep in mind that was contraction let's

88
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:38,849
look at the relaxation phase this acetyl

89
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,520
co cool Lister race sorry

90
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,969
acetylcholinesterase hthe

91
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,650
is a protein and it removes

92
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,870
acetylcholine from the synaptic cleft

93
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,849
this is kind of like the opposite here

94
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,110
here's our acetylcholine little red dots

95
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:59,669
and here's our acetyl choline histories

96
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,920
a cynical Lin histories is the protein

97
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,719
represented by the blue molecule here

98
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,849
what's happening is that's binding

99
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,310
that's removing the see the coin from

100
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,639
the synaptic cleft that removal of that

101
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,069
is stopping this signal from occurring

102
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,479
calcium ions are transported back into

103
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,060
the sarcoplasmic reticulum

104
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,738
no sir returning back here to be stored

105
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,019
because they're no longer having the

106
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:25,620
voltage change down the t-tubule so

107
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,829
they're going back lastly triple myosin

108
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,060
binds

109
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,939
binds to active sites on the actin

110
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,129
causing the cross bridge to detach so

111
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,689
you notice we now have a lath of a cross

112
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:38,850
bridge because they have a lack of

113
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,189
calcium which is because of our binding

114
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,930
up of acetylcholine so this is kind of

115
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:46,050
the opposite effect here and this is

116
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,060
that relaxation phase very different

117
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,400
than the contraction phase so I know

118
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,970
this does involve a little bit of

119
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,009
neurotransmitters and a little bit

120
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,230
introduction to the nervous system but

121
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,509
it is very important when we're looking

122
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,250
at the contraction of muscles how they

123
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,969
recommend you watch my sliding filament

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,439
theory video lecture also to understand

125
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,490
a little bit more about what's going on

126
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,490
with the contraction process
