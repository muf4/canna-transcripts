1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
I'm here we're gonna investigate plant

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,969
hormones in the general sense I'm just

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,099
giving an overview of the impact that

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,678
certain ones can have as you can see in

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,048
the picture here hormones can impact

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,048
plant behavior dramatically if used in

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,000
the right amounts so hormones in general

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,039
hormones are organic substances produced

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,719
in small amounts that regulate or

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,090
coordinate metabolism growth in

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,618
morphogenesis there's a couple listed

12
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,050
here which I'll have separate videos on

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,539
described in more detail cytokines can

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,480
induce the growth of the shoots auxins

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,200
can promote route initiation

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,238
gibberellins consume late stem

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,070
elongation and others can trigger

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,259
velocity we're not going to focus on

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,289
this one too much here we're also going

20
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,049
to go over abscisic acid so basically

21
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,609
one processing just in the general sense

22
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:49,890
looking at a receptor that binds we have

23
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:50,820
this hormone again there's small amounts

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,039
but they're binding to a specific

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,730
receptor then there's signal

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,250
transduction

27
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,558
these are relay molecules the number of

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,509
molecule at molecules activate and be

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,308
increased exponentially this is why

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:04,739
hormones are needed such small amounts

31
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:07,319
because they can initiate a large

32
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,540
response through relay molecules these

33
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,389
really molecules can then impact a

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,150
cellular response by affecting the DNA

35
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,640
expression in this case so the activity

36
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,280
is initiated indirectly via the action

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,049
of secondary messengers notice this

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,549
small round val-kill is able to get

39
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,280
through the pore of the nucleus and

40
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,150
adjust the cell a response by adjusting

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,400
the gene regulation now we have some

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,170
different examples here of different

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,219
types of hormones keep in mind there's

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,920
two key categories there's lipid soluble

45
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,078
hormones or steroid hormones give the

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,850
details here key part is these are able

47
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,828
to go through the phospholipid bilayer

48
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:49,048
and enter the inner part of the cell

49
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:50,639
making directly initiate the production

50
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,320
of proteins within a target cell

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,780
because they easily diffuse that

52
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,118
cellular membrane the hormone cells to

53
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,728
bind to receptor in the cytosol and that

54
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,438
forms a receptor hormone complex

55
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:04,349
receptor : complex and enters in nucleus

56
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,898
okay here and that can bind to the

57
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,549
target gene of the DNA transcription of

58
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,500
the gene creates messenger RNA that's

59
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,739
been translated to the desired protein

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,340
within the cytoplasm lipid soluble

61
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,219
hormones

62
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,289
those are all considered steroids now

63
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,419
other ones are water silo horns and they

64
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:23,129
have a little bit of a different process

65
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:25,738
water so hormones can't diffuse through

66
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,620
the cell membrane these hormones must

67
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,170
bind to a surface membrane receptor see

68
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,390
here receptor that initiates a cell

69
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:36,149
signaling pathway within the cell

70
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,279
involving proteins these protein kinases

71
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,920
phosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,318
this activates the proteins in the cell

73
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,568
that carry out the chart is specified by

74
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,849
the hormone so there's a little bit of

75
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:50,068
extra binding site it needs to cry on

76
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,590
the external surface because water

77
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:55,018
soluble hormones can't go through the

78
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,000
philosopher lipid bilayer those lipids

79
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,219
remember those tails are hydrophobic and

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,110
it will repel that so these proteins

81
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,169
need to bind to a surface protein

82
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,299
receptor here are steroid hormones be

83
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:09,079
able to go right through water Cylons

84
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,670
need that extra receptor binding complex

85
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,370
this Centro's it again the lipid soluble

86
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:16,530
hormones see here an example of animals

87
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,209
would be you know I would a little bit

88
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,669
easier to relate to the same thing

89
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,229
occurs in plants lipid silyl can diffuse

90
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,358
right through the membrane the hormones

91
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,919
bind to receptor in the cytoplasm the

92
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,500
receptor home on complex enters the

93
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,849
nucleus and adjusting gene regulation

94
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,359
that dream regulations related to

95
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:35,818
transcription ultimately translation

96
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:38,069
resulting an inactivated protein water

97
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,929
soluble hormones on the other hand these

98
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:43,318
need to bind to the exterior surface

99
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,900
he's bind with a protein complex and you

100
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,719
can see in a roundabout way they are

101
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,530
also producing activated proteins but

102
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,379
they have a little bit of different

103
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,709
pathway that protein kinase activated

104
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,539
protein kinase requiring ATP and that

105
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,009
phosphorylation that's occurring is

106
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,560
generating the protein within the

107
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,419
cytoplasm we notice here were had seen

108
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,729
transcription translation with actual

109
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,129
DNA and gene regulation here we're kind

110
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:10,048
of sidestepping the nucleus and we're

111
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:13,500
just generating activated proteins

112
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,819
within the cytoplasm the five major

113
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,970
classes of plant hormones that we're

114
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,649
going to be discussing our auxins

115
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,519
typically for shoot apical meristems and

116
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,500
that's where they're typically found

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,709
they're for stimulation

118
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,329
vascular tissue and lateral buds

119
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,109
cytokinins they're produced in the roots

120
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:30,300
and transport

121
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,598
there they interact with auxins they

122
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,889
said they stimulate cell division

123
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:36,959
gibberellins they can be an apical

124
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,810
portions and they're responsible for

125
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,149
seed germination and internode

126
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,189
elongation ethylene is in leaves and

127
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,750
stems and young fruits considered its

128
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:47,780
obsession which is the dropping of

129
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,939
leaves the flower and the fruits and

130
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:52,948
fruit ripening in abscisic acid mature

131
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,530
leaves root caps is where it's produced

132
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,550
and it can suppress a bud growth it's

133
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:00,568
also important personal motto opening

134
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,009
this gives you a quick overview of

135
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,449
hormones in their function the word that

136
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,968
may be found at different sequences of

137
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,800
the plant you knows for germination only

138
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:10,259
tuber Elms are really the most active

139
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,908
where one look at flowering and fruit

140
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,098
development pretty much everything but

141
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:16,649
ik of cystic acid is involved in some

142
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:18,810
way that cystic acid is key for seed

143
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,968
dormancy a little bit for our obsession

144
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,459
with eskalene also plays a role in there

145
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:25,978
so you can see that just one hormone

146
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:28,799
isn't doing just one task and we evolved

147
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,300
in multiple different tasks we're going

148
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,069
to learn about each of these in a little

149
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,650
bit more detail so you can appreciate

150
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,810
some of the specifics that these

151
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:41,388
different hormones and their ratios and

152
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,389
concentrations can impact plant growth
