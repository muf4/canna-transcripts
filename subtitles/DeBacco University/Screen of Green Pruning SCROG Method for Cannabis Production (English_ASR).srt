1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,279
you may have heard about the screen of

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,359
green method

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:08,240
of cannabis pruning well if you want to

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:17,278
learn more this debaco university video

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:19,278
is for you

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,960
all right let's go over the screen of

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,198
green pruning method

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,199
typically refer to scrog method for

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,400
cannabis production here we can see some

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,640
setups right here

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,959
and as the name implies it does involve

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,558
some sort of mesh screen

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,880
so first off the production for indoor

14
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,320
method shall we say screen of green or

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,719
scrog is very productive

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,558
and is an easy way to grow indoors when

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,879
the number of plants may be restricted

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,280
by

19
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,320
laws so it allows you really to take one

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
plant and kind of

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,799
maximize its area keep in mind that the

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,198
screen of green method

23
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,159
is not to be confused with the sea of

24
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,839
green method

25
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,839
which has more plants and does not

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
really involve training as this method

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,600
does

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
if you want to learn more about the sea

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,039
of green method check out debaco

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
university here

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,040
we have some detail on that method for

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,040
this method though

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,040
a screen is typically used to support

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
the plants and while it may not be

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,000
a natural pruning method it can maximize

36
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,000
single plant production and here's kind

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,640
of an example of five days of growth

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
here

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,239
of here on the left and five days later

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,478
what the plants can look like

41
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,719
i did mention this is showing indoor

42
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,159
this can also be done and not so

43
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,478
common but can also be done in an

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,799
outdoor situation as well

45
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,519
so the screen mesh and placement of that

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,360
mesh

47
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,519
so what is a scrog what's the screen of

48
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,280
green a screen that is the main

49
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,798
character of this method we can see made

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,399
of many different materials

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
but all those materials will be sturdy

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,560
materials it's commonly

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,359
has wire to support the plant canopy

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,359
there can be

55
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,640
mesh can be ropes here but we want to

56
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,959
have some sort of structure

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,799
there this the mesh of the screen should

58
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,438
be at least two inches by two inches

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,360
and up to four inches by four inches to

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,239
allow for ease of plant growth as well

61
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,438
as support

62
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,438
the placement of the screen is

63
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,398
determined by the lights used strain

64
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,599
being grown

65
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,598
and training design chosen by the grower

66
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,598
so again exactly where that's placed

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,039
will be grower dependent

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,719
you can also see the importance of air

69
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,639
circulation that's why you see the fan

70
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,239
down here as well as a monitor down in

71
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,639
this location

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,000
now the area many different styles of

73
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,359
screening materials some use

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
plastic netting or mesh other use

75
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
stronger material like wire

76
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640
concrete wire is a good option versus

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
chicken wire chicken wire is a little

78
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,000
too fine

79
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,680
of an area there could be used but again

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
that wouldn't be my first choice

81
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,239
some growers used 50 watt hps per square

82
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
foot target for their screen to give you

83
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,280
an idea of the

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
leaf area to lighting watts coverage

85
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,318
but you want to see the following watts

86
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,000
to screen size and light distance

87
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,039
suggestions and again these are only

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
suggestions

89
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,000
so again if you're growing a typical

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
kind of thousand watt i'm going to keep

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239
it about 24 inches away

92
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,599
plus and you want to have about a four

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,560
and a half by four and a half screen

94
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,560
size just to give you an

95
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,318
idea there of the wattage of lighting

96
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,439
you may have and the screen size you

97
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,280
might be looking at

98
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,400
instituting now the light dispersion so

99
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,318
we're looking at the light how are we

100
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,158
going to disperse that light

101
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,759
to maximize the space and dispersion of

102
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,519
the light to determine how close the

103
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,039
light can get to the canopy

104
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,719
also keep in mind as i pointed out

105
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,840
earlier do not forget about air

106
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,280
circulation

107
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,439
note that distances should be checked

108
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,598
with a par meter to ensure consistent

109
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,120
light intensities across the canopy

110
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,959
regardless of your chosen

111
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,039
light source so you want to make sure

112
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
that all of the areas here

113
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,679
are getting an even an equal amount of

114
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,159
light you don't have any hot spots

115
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
now the plant number so plant numbers

116
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,919
are based on how much space the borough

117
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
wants to train each plant to take up

118
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,919
however in general the goal is to limit

119
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,399
the plant number and maximize the space

120
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,318
east

121
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
each plant takes up with this method

122
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,000
kind of the complete opposite or

123
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,680
contrast of the sea of green methane

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,519
less plants do require a longer time

125
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,519
into vegetative stage

126
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
more plants allows for shorter

127
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
vegetative time that's again

128
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,239
characteristics of the sea of green this

129
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
is this

130
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
screen of green as growers become more

131
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,759
skilled they can often reduce the number

132
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,158
of plants to be grown in the same square

133
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,759
for

134
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,000
area because a lot of it comes down to

135
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,679
as we can see here the training

136
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
typical era for a plant is one to four

137
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,160
square feet depending on the duration of

138
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,560
veg

139
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,079
and experience of the grower this is

140
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
another reason why it's so popular if

141
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,478
growers are limited in number of plants

142
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
they can grow

143
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,279
these screen of green allows them to

144
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,279
cover more area for each plant

145
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,719
now timing is critical consider we say

146
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,478
more experienced growers

147
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
timing the flip to flower that 12 hours

148
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,639
of light 12 hours of dark is critical to

149
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,120
maximizing the area for each plant

150
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,280
the general lewis rule is to wait until

151
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,759
the screen areas about 70 to 80 percent

152
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,279
full

153
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,520
before grower decides to flip their

154
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,279
plants to that flowering photo period

155
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,359
exact timing can be partially strain

156
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,198
dependent since we're keeping records is

157
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,400
a good idea

158
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
now training the plants you want to

159
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,000
start typically allowing

160
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,918
four to six inches to grow above the

161
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,439
screen height this acts as the plant

162
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,159
material be trained by pulling the

163
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,839
branches back

164
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,080
under the screen in a horizontal

165
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,839
orientation going under the screen is

166
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,359
advised as this limits the need

167
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,000
for additional support to keep the

168
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,560
plants in place but is more difficult if

169
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
the

170
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,079
mesh is very fine screening material

171
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
i'll try that two to four inch

172
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,599
mesh screening is recommended this is an

173
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,038
ongoing process of

174
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
branch training to direct the plants

175
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,439
that take up the empty or gap spaces

176
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,280
so growers need to be aware of where

177
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,560
those gap spaces are and where they can

178
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,478
kind of direct those

179
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
branches to go so you don't have any

180
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,599
empty spaces because you're paying for

181
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
that light anyway

182
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
however you want to keep the pruning to

183
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,399
a minimum as you want to have as many

184
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,120
branches to fill the screen area as

185
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,959
possible

186
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,399
and this shows a great kind of under

187
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,839
canopy view here

188
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,120
of what kind of it looks like under the

189
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,319
screen where there's no leaves but you

190
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,560
can see a lot of branches a lot of

191
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,800
twisting turning to again to maximize

192
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,199
that screen coverage area

193
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
now we're pruning those leaves printed

194
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,560
leaves should be done

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,319
if the leaf is shaded a bud site since

196
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
the main goal is to increase the light

197
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
intensity on the actual buds which will

198
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
overall will help maximize plant

199
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,279
production

200
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,038
however do so in moderation especially

201
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,318
early in the trading process to not

202
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,478
further stress the plant

203
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,160
potentially stunt its growth so again

204
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,918
this is where timing comes into

205
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
play a little bit and this is again

206
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,318
where grower experience plays into it

207
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
now with this screen of green with

208
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,840
clones or seeds or or both

209
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,599
some growers believe that clones are the

210
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,879
only way to go with this pruning style

211
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
and while clones may be a little bit

212
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,879
more predictable it does not mean this

213
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,079
method isn't limited only to clone

214
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,360
starting material

215
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,519
due to the time investment with the

216
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
training process if you're using seeds

217
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,038
feminized seed would strongly be

218
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,038
encouraged but keep an eye out still for

219
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,478
that one in 100 that might be male

220
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,000
because you spend a lot of time pruning

221
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,800
and training that before you even see

222
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,079
the flowers

223
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
so you won't be wasting your time

224
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,800
pruning or training a male plant that

225
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,478
ultimately will just be discarded

226
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,079
do not forget about ventilation again

227
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,159
this is very important with this

228
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,120
method above the plants as well as below

229
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,720
the plants

230
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,478
because you're going to establish a leaf

231
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
canopy pretty tightly through that

232
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:58,719
screen

233
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,720
so it's important not to prevent about

234
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
the ventilation the screen will often

235
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
act as a physical barrier

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,959
so above and below the canopy

237
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
ventilation should be considered we can

238
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,038
see the fan here for above

239
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,720
also fans below or advised sometimes

240
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,038
this will require two separate fans

241
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,240
even in small spaces because you're

242
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,680
creating basically this physical barrier

243
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,598
lastly when you're looking at this

244
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
method looking at the plant hormone

245
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,918
influence well this does increase the

246
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,000
meristem regions and requires pruning of

247
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,120
the with the intention of maximizing

248
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,879
branching of the plant

249
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
you can see here one plant but a lot of

250
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,199
different branch points coming out

251
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,680
removing the apical meristem or pinching

252
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,400
reduces the natural auxin levels

253
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
resulting in elongation in increase in

254
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,198
side branching

255
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,478
so again that may be advised to help

256
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,960
increase the amount of branching so you

257
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,000
can get

258
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,878
maximum coverage area of your screen

259
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,759
and maximize the area that your plant

260
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,199
will take up

261
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,439
to limit the number of plants you can

262
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
grow and again a little pruning a little

263
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,000
advanced

264
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,839
placement of the screen this method can

265
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
be very productive and this is why it's

266
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,719
commonly used

267
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
but lastly don't forget about that

268
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
ventilation so you decrease the odds of

269
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,359
getting diseases

270
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,359
building up in your plants
