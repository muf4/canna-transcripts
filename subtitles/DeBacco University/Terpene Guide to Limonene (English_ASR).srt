on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,798
going to cover the terpene

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,799

so first off the scent location in

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,160
properties well

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,519
it is a citrus so it's commonly found in

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,518

lemon limes and other citrus fruits

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,079
giving it that kind of citrusy like

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
scent

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,759
lemony is one of the substances that

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,200
penny

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,960
forms so it's kind of an interesting

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,079
connection to one of the other terpenes

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,239
discussed

additive to cosmetics as well as

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,119
cleaning supplies

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,200
because of the pleasant scent that a lot

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,959
of people associate with this

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,800
the medical benefits though it goes

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,799
beyond just pleasant scent lemony is

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,479
easily absorbed through inhalation and

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,479
even improves absorption of other

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,238
terpenes through the skin and body

29
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,718
tissue like mucous membranes

30
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,000
and also the epithelial tissue of the

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
digestive tract

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,478

antifungal and antibacterial properties

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,959
as well lemon is a natural insecticide

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
in the cannabis plant

39
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,319
which is the original reason why the

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
plant goes on to produce it

41
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,599
but here we can see a lot of benefits to

42
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,039
us

43
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,039
now if you're looking for what strains

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,479
potentially to be looking for

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
when we're looking at higher

46
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,280
concentrations of this particular

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
entropy

48
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,359
here are a list here so limiting again

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,879
those great benefits that it does have

50
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,118
this is kind of a nice little summary

51
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,000
slide there and best of luck if you're

52
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:39,680
looking at kind of

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
producing more of this particular

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
terpene the plant wants to for as an

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,519
insecticidal properties we're looking

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
for it for the kind of

57
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,519
citrus scent as well as the potential

58
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,519
for medical benefits
