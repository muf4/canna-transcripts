1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
as the title suggests we're going to be

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,039
investigating the stomach in a little

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,559
bit more detail in this video lecture so

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,178
the stomach and its gastric glands we're

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,919
going to focus on the stomach is a

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,350
sac-like portion of the track and it's

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,600
kind of lipid surface enabling expansion

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,240
you can get larger and smaller and

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,550
adjust to the contents that it may have

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,528
it needs an extra layer of smooth muscle

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,630
for mixing food its gastric juices it

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,268
doesn't just hold it and sat they can

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,329
kind of move in mix as two kinds of

14
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,949
cells parietal cells which are the cells

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,840
that are secreting hydrochloric acid

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,780
into cells which are secreting

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,430
pepsinogen so we see that examples here

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,379
are parental cells in our chief cells

19
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,890
those secreting the respective

20
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:49,799
substances this is very important for

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,049
our digestive process see a zoomed in

22
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,238
portion here notice that the stomach as

23
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,149
we look at it the interior layer here so

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,619
these deep pits areas well this is where

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,750
these secretions are occurring and

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,858
they're ultimately coming out here and

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,899
this is why it's important during the

28
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,299
mixing process not only to get the

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,400
hydrochloric acid pepsinogen out but to

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,220
allow that food to have some form of

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,460
mechanical the digestion as well as this

32
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,840
chemical digestion thalassemic stomach

33
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:17,699
produces about two liters of

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,130
hydrochloric acid and other gastric

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,269
secretions every single day so it's kind

36
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,368
of a staggering amount when you think

37
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,459
about it the gastric juice has a pH of

38
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,349
approximately two so it's very acidic

39
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:30,269
this pH kills most bacteria in jessup of

40
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,339
the food and also denatures food

41
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:34,978
proteins this is a good thing as we want

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,600
to start to break them down the mixture

43
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,289
of partially digested food and gastric

44
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,239
juice is called chyme if you remember in

45
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,000
our mouths when we start adding saliva

46
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,280
that we called a bolus and now when

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,828
we're mixing these gastric juices it now

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,149
becomes time time leaves the stomach

49
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:53,069
than the small intestine

50
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,659
through the pyloric sphincter remember

51
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,548
sphincters can open and close and that's

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,960
what's allowing a portion of this food

53
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,390
hopefully after it's been at least

54
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,618
partially digested to start entering

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,739
this small intestine

56
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,468
keep in mind it goes from esophagus to

57
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:10,199
stomach to small intestine not the large

58
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:12,568
intestine or gastric anatomy in general

59
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,649
it's during ingested food mechanical

60
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,329
breakdown

61
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,610
with ingested food disruption of

62
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,080
chemical bonds these very harsh acidic

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,319
environment and also the enzyme that

64
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,719
produces production of intrinsic factor

65
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,729
and this glycoproteins required for

66
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,889
absorption of vitamin b12 in the small

67
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,009
intestine so not only is it performance

68
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:35,059
from breakdowns it's also setting up the

69
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:37,769
ingested food items for the next step

70
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,500
the stomach reforms primary digestion of

71
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,150
proteins by pets in so some digestion of

72
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,969
carbohydrates but cell they're amylase

73
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,799
and lipids by the lingual lipase is

74
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,259
occurring what's important about the

75
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,480
stomach is that it becomes more fluid

76
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,699
and around about two years of day I was

77
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,969
just hydrochloric acid it's a low pH

78
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,530
around to pepsin activity increases so

79
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,479
we may think of enzymes always working

80
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,848
at a neutral pH and that's not the case

81
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,000
IFS antigens actually has improved

82
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:07,709
activity at a more acidic range protein

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,539
disassembly is starting to begin here

84
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,459
and although the digestion occurs in the

85
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,348
stomach nutrients are not absorbing

86
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,348
that's a very important point to make

87
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:18,810
here this is purely digestion both

88
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:21,719
chemical in mechanical but we have not

89
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,670
absorbed anything yet both acid and head

90
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,439
for hydrochloric and pepsin the form of

91
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,389
the enzymes in the gastric juices and

92
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,919
our muscular contractions also occurring

93
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,018
in the stomach

94
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,659
we've put important for the digestion

95
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,200
process digestion is different than

96
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:39,180
absorption so ulcers too much acid or

97
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,949
bacterias is kind of interesting the

98
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,810
hormone gastrin regulates the synthesis

99
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,000
of hydrochloric acid increases our

100
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,129
enzyme production overproduction of

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,318
gastric acid can occasionally eat a hole

102
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,409
through the stomach wall scalded gastric

103
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,659
ulcers these are actually quite rare

104
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:57,780
actually what's been shown is there's

105
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,459
actually this bacteria that will infect

106
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,280
the cell walls and that can cause ulcers

107
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,759
to occur over 90% of the

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,129
gastrointestinal ulcers are duodenal

109
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,959
ulcers and that's our small intestine

110
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,280
there it's caused by too much time in

111
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,959
the small intestine too much of that

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,649
acid escaping out of the stomach and

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:21,209
going in to the small intestine however

114
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:23,370
here this bacteria here is entering and

115
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,288
breaking down the mucous cell wall I'm

116
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,569
getting ultimately to those layers of

117
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:29,729
the epithelial tissue and

118
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,680
that break in that kind of barrier here

119
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,490
he's leading to that ulcers that burning

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,980
that occurs

121
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,720
so actually ulcers in the stomach while

122
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,939
originally thought to be solely caused

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,950
by high acid production hydrochloric

124
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,680
acid in particular it's actually been

125
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,959
related in many cases to the presence of

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
this particular bacteria that's causing

127
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,099
this h pylori is causing this kind of

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,639
eating away of that protective layer

129
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,550
causing ulcers in form so in this case

130
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,949
it would be better to take an antibiotic

131
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,100
than an antacid to help reduce the

132
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,229
presence of these ulcers lastly

133
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,970
heartburn or acid reflux what's

134
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,890
occurring here this strong acid this

135
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,600
burning feeling in the chest caused by

136
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,759
the stomach on the acid coming up the

137
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,189
esophagus this is typically due to a

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,839
faulty esophageal sphincter you see here

139
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,449
that acid is able to sneak its way up

140
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,739
causing that burning sensation this

141
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:21,899
occurs especially when you're lying down

142
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,550
and when you lie on your right side

143
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,989
because when it's more important on the

144
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,949
right side if that's kind of the way the

145
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:34,170
stomach's oriented it's easier for those

146
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:36,180
gastric hydrochloric acid and acids in

147
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,460
the stomach to kind of leak out that

148
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,759
esophageal sphincter if it is in fact

149
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,759
salt
