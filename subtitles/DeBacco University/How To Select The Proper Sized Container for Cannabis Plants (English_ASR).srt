1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
ever wonder how to select the proper

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,679
size container for your cannabis plants

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:16,399
well this debaco university is going to

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:17,839
help you with that very topic all right

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,919
let's get into the video so you can

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,278
select the right container size for your

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,439
cannabis plants

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,879
so first off there are factors that can

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,198
depend on this there's not one quick

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,640
really easy answer hopefully i'll kind

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,560
of go through and just give you some of

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
the basic rundowns here so you can make

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,439
an educated decision

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,119
first off you want to consider what

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,519
strain you're going to grow in the sense

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,519
that

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
how big do you plan on that plant

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,600
getting also the substrate you select

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,799
what's the water holding capacity of

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
that substrate

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,839
pruning method keep the plants small or

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
you're letting them grow

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
quite large that can affect the size of

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,160
the container that's going to be a best

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,839
fit

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,759
also your growing environment meaning

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
how large of an area do you have to grow

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,479
in

29
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,599
this can be both in square footage but

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,078
also you want to be thinking about

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
height

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
as well and how that impacts the

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,640
container you can see here a bunch of

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,879
plants growing together

35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
very variable sizes of containers

36
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,439
probably not maximizing the production

37
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,760
here

38
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,719
we also want to consider factors such as

39
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,079
the cost

40
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,760
the container and or the amount of

41
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,519
substrate you might be using

42
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
smaller containers can save costs but

43
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,438
will increase plant stress

44
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,200
duration of the growth cycle how old

45
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,639
will your plants be at harvest are you

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,519
looking for a quick turnaround time

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,840
should be something that's going to be a

48
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,599
little bit longer or grower preference

49
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
simply what do you like

50
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,719
what kind of size do you prefer what

51
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,719
kind of

52
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,959
substrate are you buying how is this all

53
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,280
going to kind of factor into things

54
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,280
so providing some general suggestions

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,478
and again underline the word here

56
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,960
general because it is just that i wanted

57
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,759
to provide

58
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,158
just some example here some suggestions

59
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,840
plant size and suggested container size

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
and they send use this as just a general

61
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
guide or at least a starting point

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,879
for your kind of 12 inches you're

63
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,079
looking at about that two to three

64
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,158
gallon container

65
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,679
for 24 inches you can up to a three to

66
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,840
five gallon container

67
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
for 36 inches or three foot tall you're

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,000
looking at six to eight gallons

69
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
four feet tall eight to ten gallons and

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
60 inches

71
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,159
or above a 12 gallon container would be

72
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,598
recommended

73
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,439
again this could depend on your pruning

74
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,079
style go back to your substrate growing

75
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,159
area

76
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
but at least if you are looking for an

77
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,199
area to start

78
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,919
this is where i would suggest you at

79
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,958
least start to see how well this may

80
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,878
work for you

81
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
i also have things provided here in the

82
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,079
metric system

83
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
so you can get again another idea of

84
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
height in centimeters

85
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,440
compared to the size of the container

86
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,119
expressed in liters

87
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,800
and this is a natural progression you're

88
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
looking at the larger plants typically

89
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,480
being grown in

90
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
larger containers now it does not mean

91
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,039
that

92
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,040
as a plant goes from 12 inches to 24 to

93
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,479
36 to 40 to 60 you're constantly

94
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,479
changing the containers

95
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,000
you might want to skip one start with a

96
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,439
little bit larger size maybe not let the

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
plants get quite as big

98
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,039
so again this does not mean you're going

99
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
to be transplanting uh this plant from

100
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,318
maybe

101
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
propagation to a 12 in when it's 12 inch

102
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,399
and

103
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,919
every foot increment from there so just

104
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,599
keep that in mind

105
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,839
now for commercial production setups as

106
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,359
we see here typically these will use

107
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,598
about a five to seven gallon

108
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
max size container for their plants and

109
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,959
will reserve larger sizes

110
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,280
only for mother or stock plants if you

111
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,519
want kind of a comparison for production

112
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,280
typically five to seven gallon sizes is

113
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,000
kind of the max that they're using

114
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,759
for their production plants in general

115
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,239
so again use that as just a general

116
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,759
guide

117
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,000
and hopefully this provides you with a

118
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,120
good starting point to help maximize

119
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,280
your production

120
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,879
by selecting the right container to grow

121
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,878
your cannabis plants in
