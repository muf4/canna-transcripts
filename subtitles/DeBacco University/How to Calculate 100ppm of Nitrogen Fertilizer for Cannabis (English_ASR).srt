1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
this is a question i'm often asked how

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,318
do you calculate 100 parts per million

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,638
of nitrogen fertilizer

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,000
well here at debacle university video

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,439
we're going to go through and we're

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
going to walk you through the process

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,199
and exactly how to go about calculating

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,719
so grab your calculator

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,719
and let's get into the video

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,919
[Music]

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,679
all right hopefully you got your

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
calculator and we're going to go through

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,480
how to calculate

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,119
our parts per million of nitrogen

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,960
fertilizer for your cannabis plants

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,479
so why 100 parts per million and ppm

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,480
does stand for parts per million

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,799
well typically the goal of nitrogen for

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,558
cannabis is 120 parts per million

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,320
so for simplicity we're going to go how

21
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,199
to calculate 100 parts per million will

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,679
be shown

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
in addition i will show 120 parts from

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,799
the example

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
this will allow you to see the multiple

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,599
examples so you'll be comfortable with

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,198
the process

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,359
and apply it to your own particular

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,238
growing situation so you know just

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,000
how much to add without over adding on

31
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,519
anything to your plants

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,198
so first off we have to start with how

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,118
do you read a fertilizer label so

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,599
fertilizers will provide three numbers

35
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,159
which are percentages the order is

36
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,839
important

37
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,760
it goes nitrogen phosphorus and

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,880
potassium since this example will

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,799
calculate nitrogen

40
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,399
we simply are going to be looking at the

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,600
first number so on this one it's four

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,719
percent nitrogen

43
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,759
and this one 17. so looking at this

44
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,519
example here

45
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,359
we're just going to use a standard jacks

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,560
a water soluble fertilizer

47
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,319
20 nitrogen 10 phosphorous 20

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
potassium we're going to again focus on

49
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,679
that first number here

50
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
because we're calculating nitrogen now

51
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
for actually fertilizing we can't forget

52
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,478
about those numbers

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,079
but for the purposes of this calculation

54
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,280
we're going to focus on the 20

55
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,359
nitrogen so first question how much

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
fertilizer do you add to one liter of

57
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,438
water

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,599
so you get a hundred per million

59
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,199
solution great question

60
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,039
well let's go through the calculation

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,118
steps here so

62
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
starting with that 20 percent nitrogen

63
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,280
the goal of 100 parts per milli of

64
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,718
nitrogen

65
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
so since the goal is 100 parts per

66
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,519
million how much fertilizer are we going

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,799
through and adding well our goal is that

68
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,478
100 parts per million

69
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
so note that 100 parts per million is

70
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
the same as 100 milligrams

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,639
per liter so we're doing a little metric

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,719
conversion here so our goal is to get to

73
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,598
that 100 so how much do we need to add

74
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,800
well we've got we want 100 milligrams of

75
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,238
nitrogen per liter

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,160
we have 0.2 grams per

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,878
0.2 grams of nitrogen per 1 gram of

78
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:33,199
fertilizer this is 20

79
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:35,439
so 20 of 1 gram is 0.2 grams so we have

80
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,399
0.2 grams of nitrogen from one gram of

81
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,359
fertilizer

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
we simply go through we multiply the top

83
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,040
we

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,239
divide by the bottom and as a result we

85
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,280
get we would add

86
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,319
500 milligrams per liter which is the

87
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,719
same as

88
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,318
half a gram per liter so you can go

89
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,080
through and make some modifications here

90
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,919
again our target here is 100

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
parts per million we have 20 percent

92
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,559
nitrogen which is where this number

93
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
comes from

94
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,239
multiply across the top divide by the

95
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,518
bottom we get

96
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,039
500 milligrams per liter or simplified

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,920
0.5 grams per liter

98
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,439
so if we're continuing on to question to

99
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,518
that continued question

100
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,280
if the ratios calculated previously was

101
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,120
0.5 grams per liter

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,158
how many grams do i add for a 50 gallon

103
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,200
tank well we have that ratio there of

104
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,679
half a gram per liter how when we

105
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,318
do a conversion from liters to gallons

106
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,640
one liter is the same as

107
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:39,119
0.24 i'm sorry 1 liters the same as

108
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,039
0.264 gallons we want to add

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,480
to 50 gallons so the question is how

110
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,000
many grams do we add

111
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,280
again multiplying across the top

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,080
dividing by the bottom we would get

113
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,919
94.7 grams per 50 gallon tank

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
so something might be more applicable to

115
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,280
a reservoir that a grower might be

116
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,359
utilizing

117
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
now let's go to question two how much

118
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,439
fertilizer would you add

119
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
to one liter of water to get 120 parts

120
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,840
per milliliter solution so now we've

121
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,438
upped the concentration

122
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,598
really to what's considered to be ideal

123
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,000
for cannabis so again we're still

124
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,560
starting with that same 20 nitrogen but

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,919
now our goal is 120 parts per million

126
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,000
you can see it's set up basically the

127
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,159
same way here we're noticing

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,358
except we've changed that 100 it is now

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,439
120.

130
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,599
we solved that 20 nitrogen so it's still

131
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,519
0.2 grams per gram of fertilizer

132
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
multiply everything in the top divide it

133
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,758
by everything multiplied in the bottom

134
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,639
we get 600 milligrams per liter or in

135
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,080
this case 0.6 grams per liter

136
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
and we continue that step a little bit

137
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,000
further if the ratio calculated

138
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,478
previously that was 0.6 grams per liter

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
how many grams would i add for 1 gallon

140
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,399
of concentrate tank

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to using a proportion injector set at

142
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,758
one to two hundred ratio

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,360
and touring gallons of irrigation water

144
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,879
to be used so now we're getting a little

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
bit more complicated here

146
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,199
now we're looking at using like a

147
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,120
dosatron or a chemi injector or some way

148
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,280
of injecting that fertilizer

149
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,519
so since 200 gallons will be used the

150
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,319
grower should add

151
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,959
454 grams into a one gallon concentrated

152
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,478
source

153
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,799
to make sure everything dissolves and

154
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,399
does not settle in this concentration

155
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,919
so how do we get that well we get that

156
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,918
0.6 grams per liter

157
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,279
we do our conversions here we're looking

158
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,120
at 200 gallons

159
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:22,000
well we want to have 454 grams uh to be

160
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,160
dispersed over that 200 gallons so we

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,600
take that one gallon concentrate

162
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,560
which is where the tube of our dosatron

163
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,520
would go into we'd mix in 454 grams stir

164
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
that up well

165
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,519
run it for the duration of time to get

166
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
out to our 200 gallons because a

167
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,038
1 to 200 ratio means 1 gallon of

168
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,879
concentrate will be used

169

ratio mixed

174
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
