1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
have you ever looked at a product label

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,960
of cannabis and wondered what all those

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,120
information is telling you well this

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
debaco university video will go through

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,039
and break down

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
a label to help you understand all the

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,480
nuances

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,198
that the information that the label can

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
provide you with

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,199
[Music]

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
all right let's get into understanding a

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
sample label for cannabis products

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,160
now they all may look slightly different

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
some may look like this we're going to

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,839
go over one that's a little bit more

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,920
kind of what you typically would see on

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,239
the outside packaging

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
so first off we're looking at a sales

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,439
page so

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,799
this may be what you see on a website

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,479
page and provide you with some of the

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,759
general information you can see right

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,679
here about the product

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,359
that serves best for comparisons to

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,600
other available products

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,719
kind of what the cost is is it in stock

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,480
how much

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,239
in this case thc levels thca levels

29
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,439
kind of that little comparison there

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,198
bringing into a little bit more of the

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,118
details of the actual label that might

32
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,118
be on a product like this

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,040
so that website information there are

34
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,760
often used for the initial selection

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
process

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
but then once you go through and have

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,760
that selection you might be getting a

38
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,199
product label

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
what is that product label actually

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,159
going to tell you so here's just an

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,879
example

42
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,200
of a product label we can see this one

43
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,239
clearly kind of evident here and labeled

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,519
with different parts

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,158
where i'm going to go through and break

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,200
down each of these 15 individual parts

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
in more detail

48
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,320
but this is an example of this kind of a

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,400
label may look like

50
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,399
and there's a lot of information that is

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,280
presented in a very small space very

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
efficiently

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
if you know how to read it so starting

54
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,478
here with number one there well

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,320
number one is the ct pharma logo so this

56
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,000
product is produced by ct pharma

57
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,519
this is their logo right here it's

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,879
always advised to have some company

59
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,798
advertising as you want

60
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,719
consumer recognition for your product

61
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,200
the intention is to have them associate

62
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,200
the consumers associate your company

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
with a quality product and that's why

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,640
it's kind of like top

65
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,679
and center moving our way down the label

66
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,519
to number two

67
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
this is related to the strain name and

68
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,359
also the product

69
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,959
name so in this case what is actually

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080
being purchased

71
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,319
in this case we're looking at a dry

72
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
flour example this does apply to other

73
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,238
cannabis related products as well but

74
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,079
this is referring to a dry flour example

75
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,680
so now we can get into working our way

76
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
down to number three here

77
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
we have the product potency and this t

78
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,159
32 percent

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
here refers to the product having 32

80
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,439
percent

81
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
thc and it would be officially confirmed

82
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,840
lab test and we'll talk a little bit

83
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,199
more about that

84
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,719
great there's ways to visually inspect

85
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,878
flowers and visually compare flowers

86
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,439
this is looking at the actual percent

87
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,639
of thc generated from the third party

88
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,479
lab

89
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,399
working way down here we see a color bar

90
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,318
indicator this isn't necessarily an

91
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,879
industry standard but for the ct pharma

92
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:50,479
here

93
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,239
indica is going to be a purple color

94
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,439
sativa and orange and a hybrid is going

95
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,800
to be a green color

96
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,560
makes it really easy for quick

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
comparisons however it's in not

98
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,959
necessarily an industry standard

99
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,400
don't think just because you're buying

100
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,280
something else that has this kind of

101
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,120
orange color

102
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
that it must be a sativa versus the

103
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,878
green the blue and

104
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,919
so the colors in this example for this

105
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,318
particular company

106
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,598
this is what they represent working a

107
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,000
little further down number five

108
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,759
type and approximate potency so while

109
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
many consumers will look at and

110
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,280
while important you should be looking at

111
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
more than just this more than just oh

112
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
it's a

113
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,039
sativa they're 31.93 thc

114
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
you need to be looking at getting into

115
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,158
even more detail

116
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,919
on there but it does provide you there

117
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,759
just you have some idea of

118
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,598
what you're purchasing and we can see in

119
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,798
other labels too

120
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,560
kind of their method of organization

121
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,120
might be a little bit different but this

122
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,039
is a nicely outlined label right here

123
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
okay number six we have the date tested

124
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,679
this is the approximate date that the

125
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
product was tested

126
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
by a state approved laboratory

127
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,079
so we can see here it definitely says

128
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,359
dates tested and it gives you the date

129
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,400
right here with the

130
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
month the day followed by the year

131
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,519
then we have the lot number so number

132
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,280
seven here lot number

133
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
the lot number is a combination of four

134
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,080
numeric digits that are given to a group

135
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
of products

136
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
that were manufactured in the same batch

137
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,519
there so they might be unique

138
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,799
different lot numbers especially with

139
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
different products so i don't think it's

140
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
only unique to canvas a lot of times

141
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
you're picking up here a candy bar

142
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,679
could see lot numbers also provided on

143
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
that packaging

144
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,000
then we get into the ndc of the national

145
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,918
drug code four digit national

146
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
drug code assigned to the product here's

147
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,120
a link if you want the directory

148
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,879
and when we're looking at number eight

149
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,680
here the ndc the number is given right

150
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,319
here

151
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
and that product code national drug code

152
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,879
i should say applies to a variety of

153
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
other products as well

154
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,719
so it's not just cannabis here in this

155
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,000
case we're looking at 0 5

156
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,080
0 1 5 0 being the product code for

157
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,079
advil there so again just kind of makes

158
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,439
it that nice way to have that comparison

159
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,599
and that standardization

160
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,959
all part of the required labeling

161
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
process

162
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,159
moving on to number nine here we have

163
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,120
the quantity and that refers to the

164
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,120
amount of product

165
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,120
per unit so in this case we're looking

166
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,319
at 3.5 grams you want to have an idea of

167
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,478
just how much product

168
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,918
would be it contained in this particular

169
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,279
packaging

170
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,038
we're going around here below here we

171
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,679
have the expiration date

172
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,199
so approximate date that the state

173
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
approved laboratory deems

174
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,800
the product expired so here we're

175
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,400
looking at that kind of

176
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,720
representative sample here looking at

177
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,959
giving about a year so here we have that

178
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,840
january 15 2021 the expiration date of

179
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,599
this product is listed as january 15

180
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,839
2022. might be through expiration dates

181
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,840
such as milk and other products as well

182
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,439
also present here on the cannabis

183
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,119
example

184
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,719
if we're looking uh kind of a working

185
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,439
way down here we have the contaminant

186
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
testing

187
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,800
so this confirmation that the product

188
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,079
has passed the microbiological test by

189
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,079
the state laboratory

190
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,120
as well as microtoxins heavy metals

191
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,120
chemical residues

192
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
here we see all paths that's great to

193
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,079
see on the label but we also want to be

194
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,439
confirming this

195
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,159
on the analytical report 12 is the ct

196
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,000
pharma

197
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
contact information so when we're

198
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,279
looking at kind of what's who's

199
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,719
manufactured it where are they located

200
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,399
it's good to see the company puts their

201
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
contact information on the label

202
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,679
that they're willing to stand behind

203
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,000
their products that's a great thing to

204
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
see

205
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,199
it's listed right here then the

206
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,439
cannabinoid

207
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
content a number 13 kind of little box

208
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,879
right here percentage of each

209
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,638
cannabinoid found in the product

210
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,478
they usually says percentages others may

211
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,280
do little color bars and bark

212
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,599
like a bar graph for comparison but here

213
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,000
we just see them stated as percents

214
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,439
then the terpenes located up here again

215
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,160
some go graphical here we're just seeing

216
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,160
the numbers

217
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,800
percentage for each terpene found in the

218
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,520
product as well as the total terpene

219
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,120
percentage uh right here in this

220
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,959
particular flower

221
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
unless we have the qr code simply scan

222
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,239
the qr code with your smartphone it will

223
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,319
bring you to the product page

224
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,079
and or analytical report so they

225
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
mentioned that analytical report very

226
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,639
important

227
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
on there because that's the original

228
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,439
document that these numbers were

229
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,519
generated from

230
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,279
and those analytical reports uh what's

231
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,639
why are they so important well

232
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,000
they provide you with information

233
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,038
regarding the actual test results

234
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,478
including the lab

235
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,399
the dates and the lot number it's kind

236
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,240
of like the official kind of paperwork

237
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,679
which hopefully the numbers from the

238
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,879
label were generated from you can

239
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
confirm that

240
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,399
also you can confirm what lab they were

241
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,240
using what license number

242
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,918
lot number and if you had any questions

243
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,879
you could contact the lab with this

244
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,879
information

245
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,240
and make sure that they can confirm that

246
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,639
they definitely did test

247
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
the product that you have that for just

248
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
a great way to be an informed consumer

249
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,079
check and balances is a great thing in

250
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,038
this way you can ensure

251
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,680
you're getting a product that is of

252
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,120
known

253
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,079
tested basis for the numbers that you

254
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,519
see represented

255
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,519
on that label
