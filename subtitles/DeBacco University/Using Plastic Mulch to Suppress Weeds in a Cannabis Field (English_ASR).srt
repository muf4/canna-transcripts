1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
so in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,640
going to be looking at using plastic

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,200
mulch

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,719
to suppress weeds in a cannabis field we

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,638
can see that in the image right here

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,400
where plastic mulch is being utilized

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,480
to help cut down on the weeds in between

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
plants planted in the same row

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,050
we'll look at this in more detail here

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,219
on this video

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,219
[Music]

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,480
all right let's get into using plastic

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
mulch to suppress weeds in a cannabis

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,879
field

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,640
well first off the benefits of plastic

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,679
mold why would we want to select this in

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
the first place

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,759
well it's a long used option worldwide

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,160
since the 1960s and it's used mainly

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,039
with

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,479
mainly with animal annual plants the

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,479
goal is to provide weed control

23
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,398
improve plant growth modified soil

24
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,519
temperature retain solid moisture

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,280
increase yields

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,199
of course this applies more than just to

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,759
cannabis it can apply to other plants as

28
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,878
well

29
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,960
sometimes just having onions grown in

30
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,799
plastic mulch can really help increase

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
their growth compared to those that

32
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,038
might be right next to them in a row

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,679
that is left with bare soil

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,280
plastic mulch in related to cannabis

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
production specifically

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
so when we're looking at plastic mulch

37
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,798
it's a good option if you're starting

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
with clones

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,200
due to their poor ability for cannabis

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,960
to initially compete with weed species

41
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,600
also the use of clones does not allow

42
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,199
for the use of post-emergent herbicides

43
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,640
so that's another advantage or reason

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
why you may want to consider

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,159
plastic mulch for your in-row weed

46
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,759
control

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
addition plastic mulch can increase the

48
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,519
soil temperature allowing for an early

49
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,759
plants to establish quicker

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,719
a warm set soil up gets that root zone

51
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,560
temperature a little bit

52
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,560
warmer a little faster which can be

53
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
particularly important in the early part

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
of the season

55
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,639
now the challenges with plastic mulch

56
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,200
because no system is 100 perfect

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,640
plastic mulch the removal and disposal

58
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,359
can be labor intensive

59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,280
and also expensive the general cost of

60
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,040
the material is also potentially cost

61
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,399
prohibitive to some growers

62
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
the estimated cost of up to 534 dollars

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,718
per hectare

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,520
in horticultural systems with a 2.4

65
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,399
meter spacing between bed centers was

66
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,959
observed

67
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,959
we also have to consider the disposal of

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,920
that at the end of the season

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,598
plastic mulches has waste management

70
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,359
challenges associated with it

71
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,719
so like where do you put all the plastic

72
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
mulch after you're

73
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,560
done with it yes it's hard to remove but

74
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,519
then you remove it and the question is

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
now what so what about recycling our

76
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
plastic mulches

77
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,839
well about 90 percent of used plastic

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,080
mulch that is

79
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
used in the united states mostly ends up

80
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
in a landfill

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,479
stockpiled or sadly burned it's often

82
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,919
not recycled

83
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,679
due to the limited sites and

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,399
contamination during usage

85
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,319
and simply the high cost of transport we

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
can see some sources listed here as well

87
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,560
as you're always welcome to look in the

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,879
description

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,318
for a link to sources listed by each

90
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,159
slide

91
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,238
now before you install plastic mulches

92
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,919
growers should be committed to a drip

93
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,719
irrigation method with a fertilizer

94
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,238
injector

95
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,239
simply that's going to make your overall

96
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
system much more efficient

97
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,759
since the soil will essentially be

98
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,238
sealed and i put sealed in quotes here

99
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,518
under plastic irrigation it will very

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,039
likely be needed so

101
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,560
here we see the drip tape here we see

102
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,919
the drip setup because you're kind of

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,039
sealing that environment out and that's

104
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,399
a great thing it's going to be very

105
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,000
efficient any water that

106
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
is in there but installing that drip

107
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
system will ensure you can irrigate

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
your plants in addition side dressing

109
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
with nutrients is also impeded with

110
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,439
plastic mulch so having a fertigation

111
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,518
system is also advised

112
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,519
however the soil should still be amended

113
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
if needed based on a soil test before

114
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,000
the mulch

115
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,040
is applied to the soil don't assume it's

116
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
going to cover it with mulch to add a

117
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,158
fruit and gator and it'll be all set

118
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
if soil does need a mending you are

119
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,399
recommended to do that before

120
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
laying your plastic mulch now the

121
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
options when we're looking at plastic

122
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
mulch

123
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
we want to consider the width how wide

124
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,840
will your rose be

125
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799
common widths of 36 and 60 inches but

126
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,640
others

127
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,040
options may exist and may better be a

128
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,679
better fit texture wants slick or

129
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,598
embossed

130
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
typically the embossed plastic has a

131
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,959
visible pattern on the surface

132
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
is more resistant to damage due to

133
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,039
punctures wind fatigue cracking

134
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,280
than compared to non-embossed mulches

135
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,318
also linear low density has a slick

136
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,158
surface appearance

137
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,238
but may have a linear pattern with the

138
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,560
goal to reduce the chance of tears

139
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,438
while in use another option you want to

140
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
be concerned of

141
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,000
is the thickness thickness varies from

142
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
point six mil to two mil or greater

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
be sure to use an adequate strength

144
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,079
material and typically a one mil to one

145
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
point

146
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,359
uh two five mil embossed plastic is a is

147
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,519
adequate

148
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
for most applications and is recommended

149
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,639
despite potential

150
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,720
increase in cost don't want to go too

151
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
cheap because you'll be just dealing

152
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
with a pain

153
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,280
and a mess to deal with it don't want to

154
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,959
go too

155
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,478
thick because you if you're only using

156
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,439
it for one year you don't necessarily

157
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,478
need to incur

158
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,160
that much of a cost now we also color

159
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,000
choices when it comes to plastic mulches

160
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
some of them get really crazy

161
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,279
the most common color option is the

162
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,439
traditional black color

163
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,559
but there are other coloration options

164
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,439
some growers

165
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
have the option for white and black

166
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,240
white on black which may be used with

167
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,719
either

168
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
side facing upwards depending on the

169
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,800
specific needs so keep in mind

170
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,479
how you utilize these mulches can also

171
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,919
impact potential plant growth

172
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,918
clear mulch is great for warming the

173
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,839
soil but has limited weed suppression

174
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,519
abilities so keep that in mind

175
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,038
aluminum are silver but not gray

176
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,198
reflective mulch reflects solar

177
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,599
radiation and research has shown

178
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,639
it can repel aphids which can spread

179
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
viruses

180
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,478
it can also have a cooling effect on the

181
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,159
soil and keep in mind it's aluminum

182
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,800
that's like a reflective

183
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
mulch aluminum or silver is not the same

184
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,840
as a gray coloration

185
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,599
some growers get the gray and they think

186
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,879
they're getting this nice aluminum type

187
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
color because it has a sort of kind of

188
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,199
gray appearance

189
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,960
but you want aluminum or silver you want

190
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,560
that really highly reflective

191
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,000
material and be sure when you're

192
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
applying this it's a cloudy day and

193
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,918
still

194
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,079
you are highly recommended to wear

195
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,799
sunglasses it's very very bright

196
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,639
other cold mulches as we see here may

197
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,079
affect plant growth in the positive ways

198
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,639
but more research needs to be done

199
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,240
in regards to cannabis so i can see it's

200
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
a whole wide range of colors

201
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,319
traditional black or silver is typically

202
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,000
what's recommended

203
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,600
lastly we're looking at the equipment to

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,199
go through with what we're looking at

205
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,560
committing to plastic mulches

206
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
you want to be mindful of your field

207
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,038
prep so you want to make sure your field

208
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
is

209
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,639
all set to go before you're considering

210
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
doing mulches you want to have a mulch

211
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,600
layer with drip irrigation wheel we can

212
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,960
see that right here

213
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
and then ideally at the end of the

214
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,719
season a mulch lifter can make the

215
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
laborious task of removing that

216
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
much much easier so again you can see

217
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,120
there's a lot of equipment especially on

218
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
the large scale

219
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,399
a lot of commitment to this mulch but

220
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,399
there is a lot of equipment simply

221
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,198
because it is pretty widely used

222
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,799
for the reasons mentioned here but also

223
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
keep in mind some of those drawbacks to

224
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,879
see if

225
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,600
is this the best fit for your

226
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,600
environment
