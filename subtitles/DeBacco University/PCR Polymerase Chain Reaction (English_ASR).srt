1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,640
okay here we're going to study PCR which

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,350
is short for polymerase chain reaction

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:10,649
the very brief summary of what this is

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:15,000
is we're simply taking a small amount of

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,429
DNA isn't gene in particular and we're

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,769
multiplying it so we have many many

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,390
copies this will often be used in

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,730
research this could be used for gel

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,039
electrophoresis which is a another video

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,339
topic to keep our heads we're taking a

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,189
very specific single or small amount of

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,859
DNA and we're just multiplying it in

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,219
this PCR is an efficient way to go about

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,539
this process so working with DNA is it

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,489
said we're going to PCR is gonna be for

16
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,979
amplification it's gonna use to increase

17
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,808
the amounts of DNA gel electrophoresis

18
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,569
in DNA fingerprinting are going to be

19
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:50,578
two other videos to help you understand

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,980
a little bit more of how scientists can

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,808
work with DNA gel electrophoresis is

22
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,669
going to be separating out of the DNA

23
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,218
and fingerprinting is going to be used

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,410
to identify individuals but you need to

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,308
go through the previous two processes so

26
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:07,679
when I start PCR another good video to

27
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:09,989
watch as far as how can a gene of

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,970
interest being multiplied provide you

29
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:15,118
with the link here keep in mind all of

30
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:18,840
the slides are available in the

31
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:21,840
description below so a PCR polymerase

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,240
chain reaction where is what this image

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,950
is attempting to shell is its amplifying

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,609
small amounts of DNA to literally

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,728
thousands of copies in commonly using

36
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:34,920
research labs so here we have a

37
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:37,289
double-stranded DNA as we know is our

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,019
five and three Prime's we're separating

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,960
that out or then replicating each of

40
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,609
these strands and then we're taking

41
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,798
strands from there or separating out

42
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,750
those do two strands and we're

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,820
multiplying it from there you can see

44
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,129
from this image here how quick we can go

45
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,629
from one to kind of an exponential

46
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,728
increase and if it's important about

47
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:01,589
this process and this was award the

48
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:03,090
Nobel Prize in 1993 so close chain

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,770
reactions starting with very small

50
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,750
amounts of DNA this is important these

51
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,000
very small amounts so there's only a few

52
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,159
molecules when we can amplify the DNA to

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,650
enough to detect by electrophoresis that

54
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,840
requires a lot of the same copy

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,769
and through these cycles it's an

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,700
exponential increase in that's important

57
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,370
so the basic steps

58
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,109
it requires primers so we need to have

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,939
our double-stranded DNA we need to

60
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,819
denature it which is causing it to

61
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,068
separate out primer annealing this is

62
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,199
our primers that are binding to our

63
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:36,298
double-stranded DNA and then primer

64
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,389
extension or basically going through and

65
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:41,579
extending out the eye DNA to multiply it

66
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:44,669
so short signal strands sequence of

67
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:47,579
complementary two to two regions on

68
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,318
either side of the DNA DNA or gene of

69
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,909
interest so what that means is the

70
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,979
primary needs to bind here and work its

71
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,289
way this way and this primer will bind

72
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,340
here and work its way to that way

73
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:58,679
remember they're working in opposite

74
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,299
directions because DNA is anti parallel

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,909
those five and three Prime's come back

76
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:04,439
again so the naturing stage there's

77
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,858
going to be a lot of information here I

78
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,539
provided a link down here some more

79
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:11,340
information I'm not going to go through

80
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,798
all of this I'm gonna give you the basic

81
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,390
steps I highly recommend you pause the

82
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,540
video and read through these bullet

83
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:20,039
points to help understand this image so

84
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,348
the DVD train stepper up here or

85
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,679
starting with step 1 we're heating DNA

86
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:27,539
to about 95 degrees Celsius and the DNA

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,010
strands will start to separate this is

88
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,739
going to simply break those hydrogen

89
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:34,019
bonds causing what was once bound

90
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,150
together to start to kind of separate

91
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,310
out it's important that these

92
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,230
temperatures are kept very close and for

93
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,939
the 95 if you see mentioned here because

94
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:44,310
if we overheat it we're going to

95
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,750
denature it to the point that we won't

96
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,519
get it back or we're going to break down

97
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,250
any proteins or enzymes that we're going

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,259
to need so these numbers are very

99
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,699
precise so we're taking denature

100
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,048
imitating our double strand we're

101
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,530
heating it up to the point it's starting

102
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,230
to fall apart a little bit the annealing

103
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,209
stage we're at step two now during this

104
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:05,729
stage we're starting to cool C 55

105
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,430
degrees again 50 to 65 is a typical

106
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:11,128
range we need our primers to be able to

107
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,549
bind to the DNA we need our primers to

108
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:17,129
anneal to that DNA we can notice here

109
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,199
some of the bases are listed can we see

110
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,089
it you in the opposite directions so yet

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,699
I highly recommend pause and we've used

112
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,519
some of these but it's the annealing

113
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,370
stage is the annealing binding of the

114
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,810
primers

115
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,360
the extension stage well as you would

116
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,910
guess we're primers have found and now

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,270
we're extending out to replicate that

118
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,780
DNA sequence these tack polymerase is

119
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:45,449
very important for PCR tack polymerase

120
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,099
is an enzyme protein that can tolerate

121
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,699
very warm temperatures

122
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,830
remember this is 72 degrees Celsius not

123
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,560
Fahrenheit it's very warm room

124
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:58,620
temperature is to cook around 72 degrees

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,899
Fahrenheit or 22 degrees Celsius to give

126
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,759
you just an idea of how warm this is

127
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,549
it's going through and copying it and

128
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,240
then we make two new DNA molecules and

129
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,480
repeat the same process so a thermal

130
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,600
cycler the three processes thermal

131
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,189
cycling are repeated 20 to 40 times to

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,590
bruce lots of copies of the DNA sequence

133
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,589
the new fragments of DNA are made in the

134
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:25,409
PCR also adopt templates this results in

135
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:27,449
a huge number of specific DNA segments

136
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,660
being produced in a relatively short

137
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,550
period of time so myself up here looking

138
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,740
down a little bit here's our single

139
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,290
molecule going through one cycle one

140
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,050
alkyl goes to two going through another

141
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,750
cycle this to Michael's go-to for those

142
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,800
four go to eight eight go to 16 after

143
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:49,649
ten cycles were repeating we get to 1024

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,620
after twenty more cycles we end up with

145
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,789
literally over a million molecules so

146
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,060
you could see how this exponential

147
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:59,280
increase does occur certain things we

148
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,410
need so that PCR tubes do not require

149
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,179
aren't very large they don't require a

150
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,420
lot of space so I have an example of one

151
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,139
right here just give you an idea of what

152
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:12,420
it may look like compared to what dime

153
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,009
they're not very big so if we aren't

154
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,810
talking a lot of areas that compared to

155
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:18,449
a dime we're not looking a lot a lot of

156
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,910
area here we're putting a lot into these

157
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,069
so the basic components are the DNA we

158
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,740
need the code to be copied nucleotides

159
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,599
because we need to make more DNA primers

160
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,819
to bind to the specific region we're

161
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,820
interested in but first to maintain the

162
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,129
pH for the enzymes to work efficiently

163
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:37,019
in magnesium chloride which affects the

164
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,819
peritoneal and intact clarice activity

165
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,899
again that tech polymerase isn't and

166
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,670
then that makes the complement

167
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,739
complementary strand

168
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,670
it's high-temperature time and doesn't

169
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,009
denature in these little PCR tubes this

170
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,430
is pretty easy here without evan gloves

171
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,050
on

172
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,870
you could see it can be very difficult

173
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,689
to open and close these and we don't

174
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,110
just do it once you can get literally on

175
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:03,389
entire bags of these and you can go

176
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,389
through and they're very stimulus it

177
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:10,439
says if it focuses on there it might say

178
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,990
thin wall and that's because you want it

179
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,899
thin because you want to temperature to

180
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,680
be able to exchange from the outside

181
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:21,689
environment to that inside measurement

182
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,860
so again here's our basic components we

183
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,230
see it all kind of mixed in here

184
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,810
Technomancer DNA or nucleotides primer

185
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:31,350
our buffer solution all this is

186
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,240
occurring in this small of to Steve you

187
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,100
an idea that exponential increase kind

188
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,629
of put in numbers to it here's a number

189
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,210
of cycles starting with basically one

190
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,740
copy of DNA theoretically and going

191
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:44,609
through about thirty to thirty four

192
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,530
cycles and you can see how large of it

193
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,990
increase that occurs typically around

194
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:51,478
30s with average are on it would only

195
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,639
take starting with one copy after 30

196
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,339
cycles you would get to this extremely

197
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,139
large number you could see only takes 20

198
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,329
cycles to get to literally a million

199
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,889
copies and that just goes to exponential

200
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:07,589
from there now puts it in a graphical

201
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:09,649
form and spins PCR is 2 to the N and

202
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,239
that's what's causing to be exponential

203
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:14,579
so discovered attack plummets this is

204
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,788
helmet made PCR possible it was

205
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,009
discovered and it's a bacteria in hot

206
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,569
springs so there's a hot springs here

207
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,550
it's a very warm temple hundred

208
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,689
thirty-four degrees Fahrenheit this tech

209
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,639
learners can operate under these

210
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:28,788
conditions about eighty degrees Celsius

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,409
it would deviate from most proteins

212
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:33,750
especially are naturally occurring DNA

213
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,310
polymerase so to discover these hot

214
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,059
springs in these bacteria able to

215
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,619
survive in there

216
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,559
they have proteins that are able to

217
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,620
maintain their function in at these high

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,969
temperatures so I mentioned was thermo

219
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,589
cycling and this kind of puts in a

220
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,779
graphical form that I think helps

221
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,570
explain it a little bit more so our

222
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,689
initial denaturing that heating up to 94

223
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,400
degrees Chris for about three minutes

224
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,380
and then the Denia turn process we're

225
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,600
going through our cycles we go home well

226
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:03,120
extend it for another minute we drop the

227
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,950
temperature down to 55 for 45 seconds

228
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,049
that's allowing the primers to bind or

229
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,790
anneal then we're heating it up to 72

230
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:10,349
degrees to allow that extension phase to

231
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:12,449
allow those primers to do their job and

232
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,790
we're repeating this 35 times in this

233
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,009
case you'll see it's a very end here it

234
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:20,099
says go down to 4 degrees Celsius and

235
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:22,470
hold for infinity what happens is you

236
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,450
might turn these PCR machines on at the

237
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,610
end of the day you basically

238
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,890
automatically run when they're all done

239
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,169
with their 35 cycles they go down to 4

240
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,669
degrees and just kind of hold it that 4

241
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:34,709
degrees is relatively cool temperature

242
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:38,219
it's basically just keeping it in

243
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:41,940
maintaining your PCR tube with hopefully

244
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,230
all of your amplified DNA sequence for a

245
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,580
long period of time so you can come back

246
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,940
and get it without having anything to

247
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,980
happen to it via that denature step

248
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,780
double strand into single stranded DNA

249
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,210
and kneeling as those primers are

250
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,339
starting to bind and step 3 is the

251
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,889
extension Phase II are seeing all this

252
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,450
nucleotides bind just to go back for a

253
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,519
second if you want more information it

254
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,300
did include a link to a PowerPoint and I

255
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,799
got some of these great images from that

256
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,750
cycle summary it's kind of the same

257
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,819
thing we've got there Preedy deterrent

258
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,049
just starting out then you're 30 cycles

259
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,520
again it depends on what you want to

260
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:19,019
amplify 95 degrees down to 52 degrees

261
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,240
for the annealing phase extension phase

262
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,919
you warm it up and extension to carry

263
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,990
out for again repeat the denaturing

264
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,059
phase so on and so forth just to give

265
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,240
you an idea this is a repeated cycle

266
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:33,329
process took little PCR attempt

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,220
sometimes so again this is different

268
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,430
protocols maybe four different DNA

269
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,730
sequences in particular the DNA change

270
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:45,059
death at 90 to 95 it can be changed on

271
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,100
how many c2g bonds occur northern if

272
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:50,039
those have three hydrogen bonds versus

273
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,690
ATT bonds there's only f2 that 25 to 40

274
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,730
cycles depends on the protocol you need

275
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,790
to follow and that stopped the reaction

276
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,769
at differing and holds for four degrees

277
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:01,879
for basically infinity or until you come

278
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:01,879
back and attend the machine

279
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,700
as I mentioned the temperature might

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,580
change with the primers in the is T's

281
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,810
and G's and C lines that you may have

282
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,750
annealing temperature been in that

283
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:14,889
primer sequence and there's a calculator

284
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,139
I'm going to go through and calculate

285
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,870
any here I want to provide you with that

286
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:21,909
so you could see the difference in a

287
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,399
kneeling temperature based on the amount

288
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:27,339
of G and C bonds that occurs so that

289
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,649
temperature that approximate melting

290
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,920
temperature temperature Milton soon as

291
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:35,199
times to for a and T bonds added to four

292
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:38,860
times for G and C bonds they have a

293
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,290
greater influence on the temperature

294
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,710
that would take to melt or separate that

295
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:47,529
DNA sequence so if G and C content is a

296
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,300
greater than or equal to 50% start to TM

297
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,789
for annealing temperature so you're

298
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:54,129
seeing that this is altering that

299
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:56,230
temperature the more G and C bonds the

300
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:59,860
greater the temperature is needed to

301
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,759
separate those those PCR machines have

302
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,700
been talking about this is what they

303
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:07,360
look like a bridal link to where look

304
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,000
where they're actually offered this is

305
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,789
simply heating and cooling that specific

306
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,029
cycle they are not the very cheap

307
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:18,459
despite what they may do I need an

308
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,069
example of one here over six thousand

309
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,500
dollars for one you see them commonly in

310
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:27,280
labs and they vary in price all over and

311
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,980
they all do different things however the

312
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,779
basic process is all the same some hold

313
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,629
more some that heated lids and other

314
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,549
fancy features but they're basically

315
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:40,029
going through that same heating and

316
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:41,769
cooling phase the history and

317
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,419
applications of PCR can exceed the

318
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:45,309
Sammis it was first reported at the

319
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:51,129
replication of single strand DNA from a

320
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:53,199
template was basically discovered then

321
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,759
you could see all the way up to 93 when

322
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,370
it was awarded the Nobel Prize in

323
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:59,919
Chemistry and now they're very commonly

324
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,610
used in genomic research article testing

325
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,750
human identification and pathogenic

326
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,519
identification if you want another

327
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,429
summary video on this I provided a link

328
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,990
down here hopefully this is helpful of

329
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:12,989
going over what PCR is
