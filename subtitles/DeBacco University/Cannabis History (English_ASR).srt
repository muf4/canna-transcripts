1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,970
here I'm gonna provide you with a very

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,140
brief history on the cannabis plant also

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:08,820
give you some resources where you can

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,980
kind of see a little bit more of the

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,059
timeline or lineage for this particular

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,190
crop so first off cannabis hemp in

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:19,739
particular it was used about 6,000 to

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,500
7,000 years ago archaeologists found

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:25,439
hemp fabrics in northern China that date

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,390
back to as much as 7,000 years ago an

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,129
interesting note though is that evidence

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,429
of hemp clothing only dates back about

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,979
2,000 years ago so this difference in

14
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,238
time supports the idea that the main use

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,099
of the plant may have been their

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,988
psychoactive compounds and that

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,289
necessary textures or their fibers

18
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:45,179
either the properties were likely used

19
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:47,759
either a medical standpoint or in a

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,649
ritual and again at the bottom in some

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,799
of the slides I have some links for some

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,929
further information did ancient people

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,198
use canvas well the odds are very strong

24
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,869
that yes they actually did a 2500 year

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,329
olds - of 13 old marijuana plants were

26
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:06,359
on earth in an ancient tomb in northwest

27
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,939
China is he here very clearly distinctly

28
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,709
seen the tomb where scientists found the

29
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,239
cannabis plant stick it's kind of see

30
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,919
the different layers how they different

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,188
organize things there's a close-up of

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,519
the shroud line drawing of the contents

33
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,139
and ultimately the bottom layer here so

34
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,859
you can see this shows kind of the

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,930
shroud and close-up view here so again

36
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,450
very interesting that dates back that

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,240
far they're going to give you that

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,400
overview NCR Labs has published a

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,519
history of cannabis use and they're just

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,680
excellent Google Doc link here to one of

41
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,780
their sheets realize this is a publicly

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,270
viewable Google based sheet that covers

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,030
many major events worldwide from a

44
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,949
Massachusetts based lab in more recent

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,349
history details provided that includes

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,868
the day of the particular topic that's

47
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,789
presented links of sources articles are

48
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,649
provided for each event so this is an

49
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,689
excellent resource so I invite you to go

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,180
take a look at that so you can brush up

51
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,449
and see some of the extensive history of

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,069
the cannabis use now I mention the

53
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,509
history would be you know remiss of me

54
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,729
did not mention the Emerald triangle

55
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,799
which is a region in Northern California

56
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:15,359
it's one of the largest cancer

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,980
producing regions in the United States

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,050
it's made up of three counties Humboldt

59
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,669
medicinal and Trinity counties appear in

60
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,520
Northern California

61
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:28,319
cultivation being started in 1960s it

62
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,270
became exponentially larger with the

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,719
passage of the California proposition

64
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,870
215 back in 1996 which legalized the use

65
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,060
of cannabis for medicinal purposes in

66
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,009
California what makes this region in

67
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,199
part so prolific was its growing season

68
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:49,169
matches or supports outdoor growing of

69
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:52,139
cannabis very well for long season ocean

70
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:55,129
near the ocean this also helps these

71
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:58,859
counties become established as major

72
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:01,109
cannabis producers fast forward as a

73
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,300
farm bill 2018 where Congress pitted a

74
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,050
legalized hemp which is defined as less

75
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,260
than 0.3 percent THC with the December

76
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,760
12th passage of the 2018 farm bill well

77
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,109
as this translate to with a farm bill

78
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,329
removes him from the Controlled

79
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,370
Substances Act and allows farmers to

80
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,410
pursue federal hemp cultivation permits

81
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,450
while individual states can regulate the

82
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,389
industry within their borders as they

83
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,759
see fit was seen as a major victory at

84
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:30,359
moving this forward and allowing an

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,500
expanded grow of this so what some are

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,200
saying about the farm bill it's

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,639
absolutely world history what Congress

88
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,549
did is going to change the future for

89
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,179
the industry in the world what makes

90
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:45,780
this so historic is that back in 1937

91
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:48,239
there was a draft or there was a drafted

92
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,629
bill that was implemented that basically

93
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,480
made hemp cultivation illegal now it's

94
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:56,430
exciting 2018 and beyond it's exciting

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,379
to finally have defined rules governing

96
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,900
the sale of CBD products in the United

97
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,180
States and now with hemp set to be

98
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,730
treated as an agricultural product the

99
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,560
US FDA or State Department's of

100
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,569
Agriculture will provide oversight in

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,209
the plants cultivation so this now

102
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,280
allows this essentially to take off even

103
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,840
more than it has already in a lot of

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,209
states and the federal government to be

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,430
able to regulate it and treat it in a

106
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,490
manner that will allow people to grow it

107
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:27,199
to allow continued scientific research

108
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,199
on this down this plant
