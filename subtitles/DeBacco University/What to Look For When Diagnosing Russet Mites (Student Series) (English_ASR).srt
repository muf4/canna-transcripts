1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,639
this debaco university video will tell

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,559
you what to look for when diagnosing

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,960
brusset mites however we're going to

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,638
toss it over to my student connor and

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,880
we're going to let him kind of guide you

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,279
through what he looks for on canvas

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,278
plans when it comes to identifying

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,719
russet mites there's other videos on

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,320
this on the channel i'll put those in a

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,960
link in the description but for right

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,198
now let me turn over to connor us to go

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,199
over what to look for for russet mites

13
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:37,039
[Music]

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,160
so on canvas plants what i personally

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,960
look for

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,959
on on the new shoots of the the plant

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,960
itself on the new growth

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,239
um i'll use like a low

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,558
magnification

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,558
dissecting scope to

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,759
really get in there usually like one to

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,359
two times

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,558
um and what i'm looking for is little

24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,960
tiny grub like larvae

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,358
almost like like a maggot that is

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
covering the the new growth ball that is

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,920
um

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,960
forming on the plant

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,159
and

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,919
what you'll actually see is not only

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,359
just larvae but you'll see

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
a few adult

33
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,679
live

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
larger

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,640
mites

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,600
almost look like spiders running around

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,879
kind of tending to the larvae and laying

38
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,759
new larvae

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,640
um well normally on like the small

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,799
like new buds that are forming on the

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,239
actual leaves you'll see them too

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,600
especially in the internodes of the

43
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,359
leaves

44
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:38,078
where the leaf actually connects to the

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,319
the stem of the the plant itself

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,438
right there that little green spot is

47
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,438
where

48
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,758
i find to be the the highest traffic

49
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,758
area

50
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:52,959
[Music]

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,438
so on the actual plant itself

52
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,199
these insects and their larvae are not

53
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,199
that visible to the eye but what you can

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
see with your eyes is the damage that

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
they cause to the actual plant um i'll

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,679
usually notice it on the lower leaves

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
first

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,200
um it'll be

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,118
as you can see here this weird kind of

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
color

61
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,598
green almost like a tannish burnt brown

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,439
orange color

63
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:20,000
on the new nodes of bud growth plant

64
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,239
for example on this branch right here

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
you can see this weird almost folding of

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,840
the outer rim

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
of the plant leaves

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
um

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,959
on multiple occasions here and even on

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
the new growth if you look it's already

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,360
coming in pre-folded

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,400
i call this tacoing

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
and this is a true identity identicator

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
of

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
russet mites on him

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
and what you also notice when you have

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,360
russets is a weird odd discoloration of

78
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,359
the

79
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,560
initial new growth spots almost like a

80
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,238
tannish even on this one too you can see

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,759
a tannish almost burnt orangey tinge on

82
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,080
the plants

83
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,519
compared to say

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,280
some nice green growth like over here

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,959
it's a lot more lighter green almost a

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
yellow blood growth

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,080
and you'll also notice on the leaves

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
itself

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
some stippling and some damage and

90
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,359
that's caused by the larvae feeding on

91
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,679
the actual

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,680
plant structure itself

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
over here is another good example

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,719
you can see that how almost orange and

95
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,039
burnt it is compared to

96
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,719
a new healthy growth right here well as

97
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,959
you can see here on this healthy plant

98
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,878
on my in my left hand you have nice

99
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
straight internodes

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,878
nice healthy white

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
almost white green growth

102
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,239
then you look over on the russet

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,439
infected plant

104
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
and

105
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,799
the growth is not straight it's curly

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
almost burnt

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
you see slight orange here on the

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,360
internodes

109
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,280
and overall just looks like there's

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,519
something off about the plant

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
and on the new growth up here

112
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
on the on the healthy plant

113
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,680
look at how straight those leaves are

114
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,759
very nice and healthy and

115
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,560
has a lot of pressure in them but over

116
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,318
here almost getting wilt and curled

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
leaves and the new growth

118
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,000
and that's caused by once again the

119
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,359
feeding of the larvae on the plant

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,840
structure itself

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
hindering our yield in the long run
