1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,750
ha diffusion and osmosis two very

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,489
important concepts to understand and to

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,099
be able to distinguish the difference

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,429
between the two quick summary is

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,500
diffusion is movement of particles from

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,679
a high concentration to a lower

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,670
concentration to make it evenly spaced

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,099
out here and as Moses is the movement or

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,039
change of water through a semipermeable

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,579
membrane let's dive in more detail here

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,100
so I'm with diffusion so diffusion here

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,829
we have a bunch of blue molecules here

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,770
our extracellular spaces are diffusing

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,239
across our semi permeable look at

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,730
bilayer and over time they become evenly

16
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:50,968
distributed and the outside inside of

17
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:54,479
the cell good see here our little tin

18
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,969
spheres here slowly diffusing throughout

19
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,459
these molecules become more evenly

20
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,780
spaced out so it's a net movement of a

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,420
substance from an area of higher

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,430
concentration to an area of lower

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,540
concentration down a concentration

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,390
gradient so high concentration to low

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,820
concentration so you could think of this

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,069
if you're I'm gonna go watch a movie and

27
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,289
you're waiting to get into the movie

28
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,569
theater they have the doors closed

29
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,868
you've a very high concentration and

30
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:26,819
you're passing through the doorway here

31
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:29,280
ultimately getting an even amount of

32
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,828
hopefully that are on the inside and on

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,659
the outside there so that can be a way

34
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,188
of everyone that's in the movie theater

35
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,290
and those that are still outside waiting

36
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,209
for other movies to come and that could

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,340
be a way to think about this diffusion

38
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:46,169
process key part here is it's a

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,090
selectively permeable layer now this

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,000
diffusion process it can be simple

41
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,540
channeled or carrier mediated the

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,640
general process is the same channel and

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,170
carry mediated diffusion is specific and

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,780
subject to saturation

45
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,879
so what these two require is this

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,700
protein channel for example or this

47
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,379
carrier protein simple diffusion just

48
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,050
occurs with no energy and it just kind

49
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,000
of happens way to think about simple

50
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,800
diffusion if someone sprays perfume in

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,050
one side of the room

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,070
to work its way all the way over to the

53
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,770
other side of the room

54
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,239
channel or carry mediated involves these

55
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,420
carrier proteins and we're looking more

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,879
specifically on a cellular example here

57
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:29,879
here specific to size Chow and

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,650
interactions with the channel so example

59
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,229
this channel is transferring these small

60
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,450
green molecules and that these lighter

61
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:40,799
or oval-shaped ones it's very specific

62
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:43,560
to just these types of molecules this

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,620
other carrier protein is specific to the

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,000
lighter green wool shaped ones what

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,409
means is that you might say subject is

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,319
saturation make some channels

67
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,719
rate-limiting is if there's only a

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,939
couple of these proteins in the plasma

69
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,189
membrane it's gonna limit and there's

70
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,319
only so many that can get through it in

71
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,969
one particular time subject to

72
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,060
saturation if they're all busy doing

73
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:08,810
their job it's going to be slow to get

74
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,280
all those molecules to diffuse across

75
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,400
here we're looking at that saturation

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,689
point if it's not a lot of solutes and

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,610
they can all diffuse quite well so

78
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:21,539
diffusion in solutions all molecules are

79
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,070
constantly in motion

80
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,530
remember only an absolute zero are

81
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,439
things not moving we have yet to reach

82
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,419
Absolute Zero molecules in solution move

83
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,759
randomly and the random motion causes

84
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,389
the mixing concentration is the amount

85
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,310
of solute in a solvent in concentration

86
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,119
gradient is the more solute in one part

87
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,670
than another so we see the example here

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,039
we had a piece drop of dye here it's

89
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,708
very concentrated slowly over time it

90
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,929
diffuses without any mixing the simple

91
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,670
moving of those molecules around cause

92
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,980
that dye to get moved around into next

93
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,238
same thing here dye crystals in this

94
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,549
case are at the bottom and they're

95
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,319
getting easily mixed over time now if we

96
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,850
heat up though in this case if this is

97
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,959
water if we heat up the water this can

98
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:09,209
occur at a faster rate diffusion in

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,819
solutions our solutes move down the

100
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,409
concentration gradient molecules mix

101
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,329
randomly solute spreads throughout the

102
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,159
solvent it eliminates concentration

103
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,400
gradients here we have a concentration

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,380
gradient over time we have basically an

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,870
equal amount on both the left and right

106
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:28,408
side and this occurs just through them

107
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,300
movement of the water molecules

108
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:33,788
factors affecting our diffusion rates

109
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,300
you can see here distance the particle

110
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:39,128
has to move so going back to our example

111
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,500
of the perfum if it's a very large room

112
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,990
it's gonna take a longer time for those

113
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,870
further away in the room to be able to

114
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,449
smell the perfume molecule size the

115
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,158
small amount feels will move faster big

116
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,860
molecules take a lot of energy to move

117
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,569
and it can be a lot slower small

118
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,379
molecules can move a lot faster and

119
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:01,598
diffuse a lot quicker temperature as we

120
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:04,870
mentioned before more heat faster the

121
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:07,149
motion gradient size the difference

122
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,129
between high and low concentrations so

123
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:11,948
the greater the difference in this case

124
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:13,990
the more concentrated the dye is that's

125
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,210
going to affect our diffusion rate

126
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,310
there's a the difference between high

127
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:20,168
and low concentrations it's very dilute

128
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,319
it's going to take a little bit longer

129
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:25,028
for it to kind of work its way through

130
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,189
in electrical forces opposites attract

131
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:28,360
like charges repel for dealing with

132
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:32,409
something that's positive and negative

133
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,060
charges so diffusion across the membrane

134
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:36,129
each solute diffuses down its own

135
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,769
concentration gradient will be a net

136
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:41,528
diffusion purple molecules towards the

137
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:44,560
left in the example here you can see

138
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:46,449
they're moving towards the left through

139
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,110
the solute that was initially greater on

140
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:53,110
the left side so here we have 20% solute

141
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,598
10% solute see the movement in this case

142
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,158
it's going to be mainly to the left this

143
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:59,649
leads to dynamic equilibrium

144
00:05:57,158 --> 00:06:01,329
he says the solute molecules continue to

145
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,508
cross membrane but equal rates in both

146
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:07,079
directions so at equilibrium I don't

147
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:09,939
want to think things stopped moving a

148
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,218
the molecules are still moving but for

149
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,620
every one that moves to the left one

150
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:17,288
moves to the right so there's no net

151
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,569
change this is dynamic equilibrium no

152
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:21,519
net change in the amount of purple

153
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,319
molecules on the left and right even

154
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,758
though one might be moving to the left

155
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,740
or moves to the right sitting with the

156
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,300
water molecules well most of the right

157
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,000
one was to the left so there's still

158
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,838
things that are moving but the net

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,848
effect is zero facilitated diffusion

160
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:38,288
this diffusion of sizes semi purple

161
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:40,810
membrane with the help of a special

162
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:41,500
transport proteins large pool molecules

163
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,970
and ions

164
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,670
pass through the phospholipid bilayer

165
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,430
they require these proteins this is the

166
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,170
facilitated diffusion typically teachers

167
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,350
were called faculty and we're

168
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,449
facilitating faculty comes through or

169
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,060
facilitating your learning process if

170
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:01,269
you need a little extra help we are like

171
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,790
the carrier proteins in the phospholipid

172
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:05,459
bilayer helping move this confusing

173
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,770
amount of information randomly around

174
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,239
through and getting it ideally to you

175
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:15,490
where you can learn it and then use it

176
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,050
for your own future studies facilitated

177
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,990
diffusion two types of transport

178
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,579
proteins here help ions and large polar

179
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,560
molecules diffuse to cell membranes

180
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,000
channel proteins provide a narrow

181
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,850
channel for the substances to pass

182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,350
through care proteins physically bind to

183
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,960
one side of the membrane and release it

184
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,060
on the other side as you can see here is

185
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,529
our binding that's occurring carrying it

186
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,750
through and transferred it to this side

187
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:41,409
this is enabled our channel proteins

188
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:43,050
simply just a channel allowing these red

189
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,310
molecules to be able to pass through

190
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,500
carrier proteins are physically grabbing

191
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,139
and curing them across from one side to

192
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,589
the other this is an example of a

193
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:55,329
channel protein here so last part of our

194
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:57,159
facilitated diffusion it's specific each

195
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:59,620
channel specific to transport certain

196
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,360
ions or molecules only passive the

197
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,639
direction of net movement is always down

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,319
the concentration gradient and saturates

199
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,870
once all transport proteins are on use

200
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,728
diffusion can no longer increase beyond

201
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,978
that point assuming it's very

202
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:14,050
specifically in helping students it's

203
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:16,168
passive it's down low as the

204
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,370
concentration gradient from an area

205
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:21,159
higher concentration to lower and

206
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,019
saturates all the transport proteins are

207
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,970
in use that's as quick as the rate can

208
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:26,560
go all the teachers are busy helping the

209
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,830
students as as quick as we can help

210
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,408
people Osmos is a little different

211
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:34,949
diffusion of solvent across a

212
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:38,139
semipermeable membrane in living systems

213
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,789
solvent is always water so as most of

214
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:41,918
its the diffusion of water across a

215
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:45,338
semipermeable membrane here sorry they

216
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,929
got cut off here we have the amount of

217
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,089
molecules on the left and right staying

218
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:51,639
the same but we have the amount of water

219
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,370
shifting the water is trying to make the

220
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,278
concentration at each equal even though

221
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,078
they can't pass

222
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,078
this particular semipermeable membrane

223
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,759
as Moses again that movement of water in

224
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:07,129
this case for biological systems more

225
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,318
solid molecules lower concentration of

226
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,300
water molecules the memory must be free

227
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:13,068
material to water and selectively

228
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:15,588
permeable to the solutes in this case

229
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:17,659
the solutes can't move but the water can

230
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,459
water molecules diffuse across the

231
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:22,129
membrane towards the solution with more

232
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:24,409
solutes lung increases on the side as

233
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,699
more solutes we see here here's some

234
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,429
more solute it's useless

235
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:30,979
water's gonna move across because the in

236
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:32,870
this case this is alpha salt cannot we

237
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,240
see an increase in the height of water

238
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,740
in this tube versus the side same thing

239
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,019
here we have more molecules on this side

240
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,159
and over time it's part two

241
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:45,259
more water moves across so diffusion and

242
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:47,600
osmosis a great comparison between the

243
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,730
two here think of dye mouthfeel simply

244
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,879
spreading out as Moses is a movement of

245
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,920
water here an important concept

246
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,438
concentration gradients tend to even out

247
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,659
in the absence of a membrane diffusion

248
00:09:57,438 --> 00:10:01,308
eliminates concentration gradients here

249
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:03,860
it's evenly distributes a homogeneous

250
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:05,838
mixture when different solute

251
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,759
concentrations exist on either side of

252
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,709
the selectively permeable membrane

253
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,720
osmosis moves water through the membrane

254
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:15,018
to equalize the concentration gradients

255
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,389
in this case here we have our equal

256
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:20,240
amounts of blue in yellow here we're

257
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:23,180
cousins mixing to occur and we can in

258
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,980
green here shows here different water

259
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:28,008
Heights again we're trying to make the

260
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,039
same number of molecules per area on

261
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,778
both sides as a result we've reduced the

262
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,969
water and it moves over to this side

263
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:38,120
here it is equally spacing things out

264
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,250
this is like students when they enter a

265
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,500
room they all equally spaced out over

266
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,818
time here we're keeping the same number

267
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,828
of students on the left and the right

268
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:47,448
side and we're simply giving these

269
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:50,208
students a bigger room and he's a

270
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:52,159
smaller room to make the amount of area

271
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:55,878
or square footage that a student may

272
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,499
have equal in both cases hopefully that

273
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,470
was helpful in describing the difference

274
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:04,509
in similarities between diffusion and

275
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,509
osmosis and how it relates to biology
