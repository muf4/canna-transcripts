1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,250
so here we're looking at brief overview

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:08,970
of cell theory and comparative cell size

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,400
the image here shows scaling all the way

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,920
down to an atom in small molecules and

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,490
how they rate in comparison to say a

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:20,550
bacteria an animal cell or human hair

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:22,320
and what lies in between those two over

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,929
here there's a room entry picture of

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,028
what the first image of what cells look

10
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:30,629
like so starting first with the cell

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:33,210
structure in 1655 the English scientist

12
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:35,009
Robert Hooke coined the term cells he's

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,920
this very rudimentary microscope and

14
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,689
this is the image that he saw and what

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,939
he looked through there he coined the

16
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,909
term cells because he felt what he was

17
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:47,250
looking at here looked very similar to

18
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,429
like prison cells and that's the term we

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,948
use today but he seeks structure of

20
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,570
cells so all cells have this same basic

21
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:55,530
structure now keep in mind there's

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,198
animal cells

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,808
there's also plant cells but basic

24
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,759
structure is this flexible plasma

25
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,579
membrane that surrounds the entire cell

26
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,399
and it's in both animal and also plant

27
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,750
cells the interior the inside is filled

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,150
with semi fluid material called

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,519
cytoplasm and that's true for both cell

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,590
types here inside our specialized

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,599
structure called organelles and these

32
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,880
are the and also the cell's genetic

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,039
material so we'll talk about more of

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,069
this in other videos but there's these

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,020
organelles and eukaryotes and they are

36
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,228
specialized structures that occur

37
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,840
through the cells so cell theory

38
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:36,569
detailed study of how the cell began

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,759
so 1655 was the first kind of

40
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,279
visualization of that there's kind of a

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,228
low Baron and 1830s he's trying to get

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,719
this kind of cell theory starting to

43
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,478
develop it's the unifying concept in

44
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,950
biology it in originating from work from

45
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,989
these scientists so Robert Hooke again

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:02:01,170
was first other biologists she lighted

47
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:03,449
and chuan and Fick row are three other

48
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,969
scientists that were important to

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,159
develop this cell theory again this is a

50
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,780
very early concept trying to get an idea

51
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,900
you know what is actually what these

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,979
actually structures are and this is kind

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,950
of what they came up with

54
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,109
it's kind of a summary here the cell

55
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:21,000
theory has three components the first

56
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,900
one is all organisms are composed of

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,180
cells and it says you can't 18:30 it's

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,750
late 1836 when it was kind of first came

59
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,090
about number two all cells come from

60
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,909
pre-existing cells this is eighteen

61
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,379
fifties so all cells come from

62
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:39,209
pre-existing cells one already get a

63
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,370
cell it had to come from another cell

64
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,500
that that the vision process that occurs

65
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,239
yes it does bring apart the question

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,239
well where does the first cell come from

67
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,950
but in theory the cell theory here we're

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,209
only looking at where did ourselves come

69
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:53,699
from well they came from pre-existing

70
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,620
cells the third part of the theory is

71
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,169
cell there's a small structural and

72
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,390
functional units of organisms there are

73
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,629
the most simple they're the most basic

74
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,699
structure now we can have very different

75
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:06,930
amount of cells or types of cells but

76
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,818
they're the smallest structural

77
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,189
functional unit of our organisms

78
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:12,810
yes cells may have a nucleus do may have

79
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:14,549
mitochondria me of other components in

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,370
them but the cell itself is a small

81
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,349
structural functional unit they're still

82
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,939
composed of other things but that's our

83
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:25,409
but there's a very small functional unit

84
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:27,389
organisms and cells and give you an idea

85
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:30,509
of just kind of how things kind of come

86
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:33,659
about we have our sperm and egg here

87
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:35,449
very small single-celled go into our

88
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,310
larger human fetus we're getting our

89
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:40,768
pluripotent cells are massive cells and

90
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,069
then those can come together to form

91
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,950
these circulatory systems this could be

92
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:50,310
heart tissue nervous systems so on and

93
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,439
so forth here's a kind of a zoomed in

94
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,870
picture of that original image when we

95
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,000
have our Adam's DNA basis that proteins

96
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,519
are getting a little bit bigger viruses

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,289
are a little bigger than that genes are

98
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,450
bigger than viruses bacteria are bigger

99
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,310
than the genes our animal cells are

100
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,318
bigger than that our human hair here

101
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,598
would be the largest in this scale

102
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,638
lesion here so just give you an idea of

103
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,518
what things look like in comparison to

104
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,639
one another visualize themselves again

105
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,250
they're very small heavy atoms here very

106
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,610
small proteins are kind of the next size

107
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,038
up ribosomes viruses prokaryotic and

108
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,629
eukaryotic cells will be separate videos

109
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:30,269
in each one of these prokaryotes

110
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,860
we could think of like bacteria we think

111
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,649
of that as more rudimentary more basic

112
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,780
cells and in eukaryotic cells these are

113
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,209
the ones that contain organelles like to

114
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:42,059
find nucleuses or if you're a plant cell

115
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:43,289
chloroplast the mitochondria present so

116
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,050
that's our eukaryote cells and they're

117
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,330
bigger for that reason there's this

118
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,819
great link here with some coffee to

119
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:53,609
carbon it says carbon being the carbon

120
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:56,670
atom a very simple basic small small

121
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,230
structure all up to coffee so if you go

122
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,550
this website here we'll take a look at

123
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:05,520
it learn next that you tada

124
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,040
edu you decide to have a coffee bean we

125
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,019
see these little tiny things here and a

126
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,020
grain of rice well down here there's a

127
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,759
little sliding scale here and you can

128
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,699
start to zoom in so you notice the

129
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,289
coffee bean we're zooming in helping

130
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,199
that coffee bean looks like to a grain

131
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,580
of salt for comparison the green of

132
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,959
salts quite large compared to these

133
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,229
things it's been zoom in see some of

134
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,359
those so here's our grain of salt we're

135
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,420
seen these kind of a media started

136
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,000
starting to be here so Krista the meters

137
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,870
are pure Paramecium there's a human egg

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,819
cell compared to a sperm cell look at

139
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,160
our skin cell photoreceptors rods these

140
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,420
are in the back of our eyes all right

141
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,070
getting smaller here red blood cell

142
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,129
baker's yeast how small they are in

143
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,509
comparison to the X chromosome see some

144
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,219
also some wealth in some mitochondria

145
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:58,139
how that looks compared to the red blood

146
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,810
cell well if we zoom in even further

147
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,959
ecoli lysosomes which we'll learn about

148
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,850
we do organelles a couple other small

149
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,629
things here different viruses here being

150
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:15,080
small HIV influenza but wait there's

151
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:20,430
more hepatitis virus ribosomes

152
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:23,779
antibodies tRNA hemoglobin yes it gets

153
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:26,280
even smaller phospholipids glucose

154
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:30,149
adenine should sound familiar water

155
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:32,909
molecule all the way down to a carbon

156
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:36,179
atom so this is the smallest form if you

157
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:40,140
zoom on the way back out I have a cool

158
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,069
gonna trip going from carbon atoms to

159
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,740
the amino acids

160
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,540
so the glucose the phospholipids tRNA

161
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,150
how big the antibody looks right now in

162
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,460
the hemoglobin well size of the relative

163
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:53,569
thing this is there a ribosome we'll

164
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:56,909
learn about those we do organelles

165
00:06:53,569 --> 00:07:00,959
viruses again there's different types of

166
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:04,650
viruses this giant thing over here well

way out to coffee so this is just kind

of the neat way to be able to look at

173
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,650
and compare the relative size of things

174
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:28,139
and how small that certain things are

175
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,899
and in the great scheme of things how

a nice little comparison looking to get

reason why these cells need to be so
