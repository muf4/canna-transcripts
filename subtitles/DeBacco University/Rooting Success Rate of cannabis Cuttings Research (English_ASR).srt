1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,160
while many growers will tell you how to

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,759
root cutting successfully

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,519
very rarely do you see anyone that

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,320
relates it to scientific published

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,320
research

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
and hopefully you've come here to debaco

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,919
university for just that

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,759
that's what we intend to provide here of

9
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,320
the rooting success rate of cannabis

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,879
cuttings

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,719
research to give you the best methods to

12
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,118
increase your odds of success

13
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,839
at rooting new clones or vegetative

14
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:30,509
cuttings

15
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:33,280
from a cannabis plant

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,600
[Music]

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
all right let's get into the video here

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,359
so first off here is the article if you

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
want to find a little bit more

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,679
details or information uh we're going to

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,559
provide you here with kind of

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,200
some a brief overview of this particular

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,839
article

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
in this video lecture so first off

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
realize that there's many

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,959
variables here growers often wonder what

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,280
the impact would be of different rooting

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,198
conditions if conditions are favorable

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
there would be very likely to be some

30
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,039
degree of rooting however the goal

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
for growers is to maximize the

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,118
production that's the whole

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,159
intention here is to do some show you

34
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,000
some comparisons

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,920
but show you how to maximize your

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
routing potential there in your cannabis

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,799
clones

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,719
so first off looking at canvas plant

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,200
material and factors explained and this

40
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,438
is again a part of that study

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,960
so canvas was actually used as part of

42
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,319
the study so it's always hard to find

43
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,239
that let's try to provide

44
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,158
here cuttings were taken at the length

45
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,920
of about 13 centimeters with three fully

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,118
expanded leaves from stock plants

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
cuttings were taken at the ends of

48
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,920
axiary limbs and cut at a 45 degree

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,159
angle

50
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,799
each cutting was rooted in a 5.7

51
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,759
centimeter wide 5.7 centimeter tall

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,720
peat jiffy pot containing pro-mix a pg

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,719
organic growing

54
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,239
substrate so again this gives you just

55
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,679
some background for this

56
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,078
study full factorial complete randomized

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
design with four factors rooting hormone

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,839
leaf number

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,079
cutting position and leaf tip removal

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
two levels per factor in 10 replications

61
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,959
per factor combined

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,639
so this was a pretty extensive study

63
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,078
that really touched on many of the

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
things you hear growers say should i cut

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,438
the leaves not cut the leaves

66
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,759
how many leaves should i have this study

67
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,598
gets into that for leaf number cuttings

68
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,639
either had one fully expanded

69
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,519
leaf removed two leaves remaining or

70
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,119
were left with three total leaves for

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
cutting position cuttings from terminal

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,719
shoots were taken from either an apical

73
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,719
position basically node 10

74
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,318
or higher on the plant or from what was

75
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,878
determined to be a basal position which

76
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,280
is below

77
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,719
node 10 on the plant for a leaf tip

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,479
removal treatment the portion of the

79
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,959
leaf tips about one third of the leaf

80
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,799
area

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
was removed from fully expanded leaves

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,360
or the leaves were left

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,080
uncut and lastly for the rooting hormone

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,920
factor we're looking at the base about

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,719
five centimeters if each stem was dipped

86
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,280
into either

87
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,840
0.2 percent endo-3 butyric acid gel

88
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,719
or in zero two percent will extract

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
rooting gel

90
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,239
for another source of comparison so

91
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
again these are probably some things

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
you've heard from a lot of growers

93
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
let's look at some of the data provided

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,719
to get into what the results showed from

95
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,319
this study so it's also important

96
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,158
understand the propagation environment

97
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,439
so this can also play a large factor

98
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,598
into your

99
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,280
cloning and rooting success so trays

100
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,759
were randomly arranged in a walk in

101
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,199
a growth chamber and initially misted

102
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,000
relative humidity in the

103
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,359
first zero to four days was 95 percent

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
from five to eight days that was reduced

105
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
to eighty percent

106
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
and for nine to twelve days that was

107
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,000
reduced further to sixty percent

108
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
temperature was maintained about four 24

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,439
degrees celsius

110
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
for day and night for the entire period

111
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,719
fluorescent lighting was used to

112
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,238
maintain an 18-hour photo period

113
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,239
and the light intensity was slowly

114
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,400
increased the par readings from that

115
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,640
zero to five days again at 50

116
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,680
micro moles six day six to date nine

117
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,199
eighty and day 10 to day 12 115 of

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
poverty on those micro moles

119
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,119
in meters per second to give you an idea

120
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
of the conditions

121
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
the harvest determination so the bottom

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,000
of the trays was observed

123
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,159
a daily from seven days after

124
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and onwards for for treating roots and

125
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,519
cuttings were harvested at

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,759
12 days when approximately 50 percent

127
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,759
or more of the cuttings showed visible

128
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,120
roots at the bottom of the tray so again

129
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,280
these are some of the parameters

130
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798
that were set forth for the experiment

131
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,358
and the results then

132
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,120
are based off this so the rooting

133
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,839
assessment you know looking at how well

134
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,918
those plants

135
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,839
may have rooted or may not have rooted

136
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,959
well successful rooted cuttings were

137
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,799
assigned to either

138
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,560
two classifications based on the degree

139
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,720
of advantageous roots

140
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,879
a root quality index abbreviated in this

141
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
study rqi score of one

142
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,120
or two was assigned by a third party

143
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,478
without knowledge of applied treatments

144
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,199
based on visual reference

145
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,839
that's the top image right here so

146
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,800
here's a

147
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,719
one and here's a two but far before our

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
qi measurements the substrate was washed

149
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
and rude cuttings

150
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
with ro water to again allow for a good

151
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:54,959
visual inspection

152
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
because that's how the roots were

153
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,719
assessed visually and that's how the

154
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
study was conducted

155
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,600
reading success rate of cannabis

156
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
cuttings if we look start at some of the

157
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
data here

158
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,918
the rooting success rate of cannabis

159
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
cuttings with about 80 cuttings looked

160
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,000
at here

161
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,319
the cut leaves had about one third of

162
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
leaf tips removed to give you an idea

163
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,599
cuttings from terminal shoots either

164
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,399
april cuttings again greater than

165
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,160
node 10 and basal cuttings less than

166
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,879
node 10 and those apocalypse are equal

167
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
to or

168
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,478
greater than node 10. rooting hormones

169
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,839
there's a synthetic hormone

170
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,918
or an organic hormone which is

171
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,279
willow-based bars within each factor

172
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,680
bearing different letters

173
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,599
are significantly different at p less

174
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,600
than

175
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,600
0.05 using chi-squared contrast

176
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,360
so measured in a binomial scale in which

177
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,360
any visible advantageous root formation

178
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,199
was considered rooted to calculate

179
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,038
as percentage of cuttings with roots in

180
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,038
each treatment so what does this

181
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,159
background say about the data provided

182
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,959
right below me

183
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,400
well we can notice if we look at the

184
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,519
leaf number whether you use two leaves

185
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,359
or three leaves

186
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,359
statistically there was no difference

187
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,120
between those whether using a basal

188
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
cutting or an apogee cutting again

189
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,639
no statistic difference between those

190
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,560
however

191
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,160
with cutting the tips or not cutting the

192
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,959
leaf tips there was a significant

193
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
difference

194
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,799
and to get the increased rooting success

195
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,759
it is suggested here by the data

196
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
to not cut the leaves there in addition

197
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,439
to whether applying the organic or the

198
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,959
synthetic rooting hormone

199
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,120
in this case the synthetic hormone

200
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,000
definitely had a much greater

201
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,038
rooting success than the organic one so

202
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,720
again leaf number

203
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,800
where you took the cuttings from not

204
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,160
major difference at least statistically

205
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
based on this study

206
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
uncutting the leaves and using synthetic

207
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,799
hormone definitely did make a

208
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,199
statistically difference

209
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
improve improvement in rooting success

210
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,038
we're looking at the loop root quality

211
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,919
index of the cutting so again 80 were

212
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,439
used

213
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,279
looking at the cut and the uncut leaves

214
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,800
here we're looking at

215
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,318
the bars within each factor being

216
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,038
different letters anything different at

217
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,120
p

218
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,800
less than 0.05 using chi-squared

219
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
contrast we can see the

220
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,079
again same basic pattern here we're

221
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
looking at leaf number

222
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,439
and synthetic pattern here providing

223
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,479
definitely the greatest

224
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,240
difference there reading success rate

225
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,318
so where we're looking at where we took

226
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,120
those cuttings this is a

227
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,400
number of 40 individual plants here cut

228
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
leaves had about one third of these tips

229
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,519
removed

230
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,800
cuttings from the terminal shoots again

231
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,719
the apical

232
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
equal to or greater than node 10 basal

233
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
cuttings less

234
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,879
are under node 10. and again the same

235
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,240
statistical analysis applied there and

236
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,038
here we see the example

237
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,918
of looking at the basal or apical here

238
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,598
shoot tips

239
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,120
looking at whether you cut or uncut the

240
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,879
leaves as if the leaves were cut

241
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
in this case if you do cut the tips of

242
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,800
the leaves the apical

243
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
area did show an improvement in rooting

244
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,598
success

245
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,119
however if you leave them uncut it

246
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,519
doesn't matter where you take them from

247
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,840
statistically there is no difference in

248
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,359
the rooting success rate

249
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,799
so what's the research summary here what

250
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,038
have we learned from looking at all this

251
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
data and how can apply that to our own

252
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,478
potential cannabis clones well rooting

253
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,120
hormone of 0.2

254
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,279
iba gel delivered higher rooting success

255
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,199
rate than the 0.2 percent will extract

256
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,119
so that would be advised to use

257
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,879
cutting 30 of the leaf tips reduced

258
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
reading success rate so it is not

259
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,199
advised to cut those uh leaf tips

260
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
number of leaves three leaves had a

261
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,160
higher root quality compared to two

262
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,199
leaves without influencing rooting

263
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
success rate

264
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,639
and the position of cutting on the stock

265
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,598
plant did not influence either reading

266
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,598
success rate

267
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,878
or the root quality you might want to go

268
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,839
back to some of the previous slides or

269
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,560
pause the video

270
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,519
to look at those charts presented in a

271
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,879
little bit more detail

272
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,959
yourself but lastly to maximize rooting

273
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
success what's the quick general summary

274
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,879
here

275
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,639
we want to take plant material from

276
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,479
either the apical or basal positions

277
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,679
that doesn't matter you want to make

278
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,320
sure the cuttings have at least

279
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,239
three fully expanded leaves you do not

280
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,000
want to cut the tips of the leaves off

281
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,959
at any point that will again reduce your

282
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,559
rooting success

283
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,159
you might dip the cuttings in iba

284
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,719
reading hormone to help

285
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,639
increase your and maximize your rooting

286
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
success and quality cuttings

287
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,879
that you can produce and here it is

288
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,639
supported with scientific research doing

289
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,799
comparisons between different methods

290
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,759
growers may use and hopefully you found

291
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,319
this helpful

292
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:07,838
and it will improve your rooting success

293
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,839
on the clones that you take
