00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,240
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,359
here i'm going to go over the cut and

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
stick method of

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,559
cannabis cloning and hopefully some tips

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,759
and tricks

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:17,170
to make sure if you're trying this

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:20,240
method you are successful at it

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,520
[Music]

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,518
all right let's get into the cut and

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,198
stick method for cannabis cloning

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,358
well first off we want to make sure we

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,000
have the necessary materials

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,840
to be successful so with cloning or

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
vegetative propagation in general

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,280
healthy mother or stock plant is

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,879
important regardless

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,640
of what method we're using definitely

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,239
for this method as well we want to have

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
a growing substrate we want to have a

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,679
rooting hormone

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
method of labeling and documentation in

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,439
a favorable propagation environment

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
so that growing substrate can be

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,119
variable some people will choose oasis

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,479
some people choose root riots some

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,320
people choose rock wool some people

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,279
choose sands people who choose

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,039
stairless media all of those can work

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,558
rooting hormones to the example here of

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,160
clonex there's many other different

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,759
types of reading hormone all of them

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,438
tend to fall into the category of the

33
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,280
plant hormone auxin

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,679
and then proper method of labeling and

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
documentation so here we see the labels

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,960
labeling the clones we also want to have

37
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,118
a backup for that

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,158
no excuse to be taking clones and forget

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,719
which one was which

40
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,880
have redundancies within your system and

41
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,438
also a favorable propagation

42
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,039
environment to encourage those clones

43
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,438
that are going through a stressful time

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
to go through and root well so they can

45
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,118
be transferred to the next step

46
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,519
now what does the environment look like

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,799
well here's just some examples here of

48
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,158
getting into what the

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,720
kind of environment you should be

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,719
shooting for or aiming for your targets

51
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,759
so first off your temperature 78 to 82

52
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,719
degrees fahrenheit

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,319
or 25 to 28 degrees celsius moisture

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,039
level around 90 percent

55
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,039
relative humidity at least to start and

56
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,680
you want to be decreasing that as

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,920
the clones are progressing and then

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,640
light levels 200 to 350

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
par reading approximately diffused light

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,599
is fine because they are going through

61
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,519
kind of that stress

62
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,959
typically i do not recommend cutting the

63
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,560
leaf tips i like to remain

64
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,478
keep the leaf tips there it actually can

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
help increase the odds of your routing

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,440
success

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
another video on that on this channel

68
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,719
but here we can see just the general

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
conditions now for 90

70
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,840
how do you know you're approaching 90

71
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,598
percent well if you're using humidity

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
dome there should be moisture on

73
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,119
that dome now that substrate that i had

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
mentioned

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,439
when i take the cutting that's about six

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,120
to ten inches long you can go shorter

77
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,878
but that's a good kind of healthy clown

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
especially if you're starting out

79
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,840
then you want to apply a ridding hormone

80
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,439
and then you literally stick it into the

81
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
media that's where this gets its name

82
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,318
the cut

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,439
and the stick method now i said that

84
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,280
humidity dome

85
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,680
you could use a large humidity dome over

86
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
entire tray or you could simply invert a

87
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
clear cup here

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,759
to increase the humidity around that

89
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,239
clone particularly on the early on

90
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,959
portion of the routing process so

91
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,200
hopefully this

92
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,878
if you're looking at propagating canvas

93
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,958
clones vertically with this

94
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,799
cut and stick method hopefully this

95
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,519
provides you with some basic information

96
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519
to increase your odds of success
