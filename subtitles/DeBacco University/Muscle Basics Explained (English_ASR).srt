1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
this debaco university video will be

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,040
explaining the basics of muscles we'll

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,800
get into some of the slight into the

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,080
details but hopefully give you a good

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,080
overview of understanding

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,559
[Music]

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,879
all right let's get into muscle basics

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,759
explained here well first off why do we

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,439
see striations in our skeletal muscles

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,519
well this is because the microfibrils

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,320
are densely packed in their rod-like

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,799
contractile elements called myocytes you

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,039
can see that kind of right here in the

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,519
image they make up most of the muscle

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,759
volume and myofibrils are perfectly

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,600
aligned within the fiber they do create

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,759
this repeating series of a bands and i

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
bands so this i band is a way to

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,558
remember it light

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,600
i is in light so you have that i for the

21
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,078
i bands and then the dark or the a bands

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
right here so dark has the letter a in

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,960
its second letter and that's

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,679
can help you remember that dark a bands

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,920
light i bands on there

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
so sarcomere is in this banding pattern

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
well there's thin filaments that don't

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
overlap the thick filaments in the

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
lighter h zone

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,759
the m lines appear darker due to the

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,080
presence of the protein desmond the

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,599
smallest contractile unit of the muscle

33
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,359
is a sarcomere as we can see right here

34
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,519
the region of the myofibril between the

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,280
two successive z discs

36
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,359
so we have a z line here and a z line

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,680
right here that is your sarcomere right

38
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,359
in that defined region the regular

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,880
organization of these sarcomeres gives

40
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,959
skeletal and cardiac muscles their

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,560
distinctive striated appearance remember

42
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,640
smooth muscle does not have these

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,478
striations and these are composed of

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,799
myofibrils made up of the contractile

45
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,438
proteins the fibrins are the two types

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,439
there's thick myosin and those thin

47
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,279
actin filaments

48
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,879
now sarcomere is sliding filament theory

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,879
so there will be another video on that

50
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,359
specifically but during contraction

51
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,078
medicine ratchets along the actin

52
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,078
myo filaments compressing the eye in the

53
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,078
h bands so i think of it is basically

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,959
there's a sliding that's occurring if

55
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,000
you have your fingers here and you're

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,679
sliding even though we have a thick and

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
thin filament we have this sliding

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
that's how you get the term sliding

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,599
filament theory the ab hand remains

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,640
consistent throughout as the length of

61
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,079
the myosin myofibrils does not change

62
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,479
we're having this if you can kind of see

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
here the h band is very spread out here

64
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,799
and here it is contracted because we've

65
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,120
slid over there more information on the

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
sliding filament theory video

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,039
so this myofibrils this banding pattern

68
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,519
that we see those thick filaments extend

69
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,919
the entire length of the a band whereas

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,560
the thin filaments extend across the i

71
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,039
band and part way into that a band

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
region you can see that right here the z

73
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,519
disc are queen-shaped sheets of proteins

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,598
basic connections anchor the thin

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,680
filaments and connects the myofibrils to

76
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,560
one another you need an anchoring point

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
because you're going to be pulling

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,479
things together so that anchoring point

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,239
so it's allowing that to go through and

80
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,679
contract

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,519
now if you've heard of tendons and

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
ligaments and use those interchangeable

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,480
terms that's in misnomer because

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,560
technically a tendon is a flexible but

85
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,759
an elastic cord of strong fibrous

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
collagen fiber attaching muscle directly

87
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,158
to bone

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,920
so tendon is muscle to bone

89
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,000
in contrast that a ligament is a short

90
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,000
range of touch flexible fibrous

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,199
connective tissue that connects two

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,120
bones or two cartilages together and

93
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,598
holds together a joint so we have heard

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,599
the acl well that l portion is referring

95
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,759
to the ligament because that is

96
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,359
physically linking those two bones

97
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,959
together where a tendon is going to

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
attach that muscle in this case the

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,560
hamstring here to the bone region

100
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,719
so how do muscles work in a very basic

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,360
sense well skeletal muscles are attached

102
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,359
to bones by straps of connective tissue

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
again called as tenants i mentioned

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
bones pivot about the flexible joints

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
pulled back and forth

106
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,280
by attached muscles keep in mind an

107
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,680
important point is that muscles can only

108
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
pull never push they can only pull

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,360
things together they don't push in the

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
other direction antennas allow for the

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,239
movement in the opposite direction so

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,360
whichever a muscle or group of muscles

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,560
does another muscle or group of muscles

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,680
undoes this so if one is pulling in one

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
way you're going to have another group

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
that's going to pull in the opposite

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,040
direction because the other side muscles

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,839
will relax causing that joint to be able

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,479
to

120
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,079
rotate amongst that fulcrum

121
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,519
so how do muscles work we need a point

122
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,680
of origin and we need a point of

123
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,680
insertion so origin is the muscles the

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,918
end attached to antenna by a stationary

125
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,918
bone it's in a fixed position that

126
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,519
origin the insertion is the end it's

127
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,519
attached to the bone that moves during

128
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,279
the muscle contraction so if we're using

129
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,680
my arm as an example this would be your

130
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,758
you know origin up here the insertion

131
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
will be down at the elbow joint here

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,360
because that would be allowing those

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,439
bones to move

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,840
now antagonists as i mentioned before

135
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,000
muscles in a movable joints are attached

136
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,159
in opposing pairs it's the antagonist

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
flexor retracts the limb and extenders

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
will extend the limb so if we look kind

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
of right here we have our movement here

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,560
flexors are retracting the limb pulling

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
pulling this up in this direction

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,918
extenders are extending that limb and we

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
see that here with the hamstring

144
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,560
compared to the quadriceps so having the

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
kicking motion here like for soccer

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,519
flexors are the hamstring pulling the

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,120
leg

148
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,799
back and then the extenders or

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
quadriceps would be extending that

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
forward allowing the individual to kick

151
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
the ball

152
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,159
now two types of muscle contraction or

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
two main categories i should say we have

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
the isotonic which is the muscle

155
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
shortens

156
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,000
thus moving bones you know the isometric

157
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
which is muscles that not shorten but

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,918
exerts a force so think of this if you

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,600
had a pail of water if you're picking up

160
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,359
that pail of water and lifting it up

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,520
well that muscle is shortening there

162
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
we're lifting that three kilogram weight

163
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,879
isometric as if we just kind of hung our

164
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,399
arms straight and we have stood up and

165
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,000
our mouth and our arms were still

166
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,478
straight but we're still exerting a

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
force to support the weight of that

168
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,159
bucket of water in this case the six

169
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,400
kilogram weight

170
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,199
so normal versus atrophy muscles if you

171
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,038
sadly have any add any accident and put

172
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,120
you know an arm in a cast or a leg in a

173
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,800
cast that can lead to an atrophied

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
muscle and that's muscle mass that's

175
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,400
reduced

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,038
simply because of not being used or

177
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,359
disused although atrophy due to disuse

178
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,560
can often be reversed with exercise and

179
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
physical therapy

180
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,839
muscle atrophy with age referred to as

181
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,000
sarcopenia is irreversible so as you get

182
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,799
older your muscles overall will simply

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,720
atrophy as a product of age

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
so muscle metabolism energy for a

185
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,280
contraction here respiration is release

186
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
of energy from sugar to make atp

187
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,478
remember there are two pathways

188
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,600
aerobic uh and anaerobic so anaerobic is

189
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,758
without oxygen aerobic requires oxygen

190
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
aerobic is preferred because there's a

191
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,160
great much greater amount of atp

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,519
adenosine triphosphate that's generated

193
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,199
however when you work out when oxygen

194
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,439
gets low aggressive workout you're going

195
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,439
through your body will generate lactic

196
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,639
acid fermentation pathway would be

197
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,399
favored to generate some atp however

198
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,680
keep in mind that when your body does

199
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,679
use atp protons hydrogen ions are

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,840
produced resulting in an acidic

201
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,560
environment it's an acidic environment

202
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,399
that causes your muscles to burn lactic

203
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,160
acid is slowly converted to pyruvate in

204
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,159
the in the liver so you'll have that

205
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
breakdown process but that burning

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,880
muscle feeling is really not directly a

207
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,319
derivative of lactic acid but it is a

208
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,000
derivative of the simple acid form there

209
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,000
other videos on this channel on lactic

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
acid fermentation more detailed but that

211
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,800
burning feeling is really just protons

212
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,959
that acidic feeling not because directly

213
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
because of lactic acid

214
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,918
if you ever had your eye kind of

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,439
twitches a little bit here where we kind

216
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,680
of get that little twitchiness of the

217
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,079
eye this can be cause of stress limited

218
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,400
sleep or high caffeine consumption

219
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,680
probably might be uh factors

220
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,318
contributing to you while you're

221
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,240
watching this particular video

222
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
uh at thanksgiving if you want to have

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,918
good uh table conversation you might

224
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,800
notice there's white meat and dark meat

225
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,878
looking our chickens and turkeys

226
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,598
uh we're looking at this

227
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
myoglobin which is muscle hemoglobin so

228
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,360
white meat is fast twitch muscle fiber

229
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,279
short energy burst

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
but it does tire quickly it does have

231
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,439
lower fat content but slightly higher

232
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,240
protein content this would be the turkey

233
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,079
breast if you're looking at the bird

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,160
dark meat if you prefer dark meat that's

235
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,478
your slow twitch muscle it can work for

236
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,240
very long periods of time it does have

237
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,639
high oxygen requirement and therefore a

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,680
high myoglobin content higher fat

239
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
content but is also mono and

240
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,718
polyunsaturated fats slightly higher

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,278
cholesterol this would be found in the

242
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,959
turkey legs wings or thighs so if you're

243
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,320
having that thanksgiving conversation

244
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,439
remember white meat would be the breast

245
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,959
of the turkey and that's going to be

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
your fast twitch muscle short burst of

247
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,199
energy for the um turkey dark meat if

248
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,560
you prefer that was your slower twitch

249
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
muscle for the turkey and that's going

250
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,199
to be the legs wings and thighs

251
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
if you have an interest there hopefully

252
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,600
this provides you a very basic overview

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,600
of muscles and develops a greater

254
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
understanding
