1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,599
so welcome to this tobacco university

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,400
video we'll be looking at identifying

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,160
chemicals

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,679
with spectrometry we're going to get

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,320
into some of the details but this is

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,638
that quick

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,519
overview we have a light source this

8
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:12,959
sample

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,798
we have a dispersion element we have a

10
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,080
detector and we're going to generate

11
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,439
at the end a spectrum here so first off

12
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,879
we have to understand color because

13
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
we're going to be looking at different

14
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,719
wavelengths and light is a form of

15
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
energy and travels in a wave

16
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,799
and the light's wavelength measured in

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,560
nanometers between nm

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,079
determines the color so you can see here

19
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,000
the red wavelength

20
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,679
has a red coloration and then we have

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,359
the green and we have the blue

22
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,280
we have all these different wavelengths

23
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,600
red has a longer wavelength

24
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,439
than the blue example here and that

25
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,160
allows us the separation

26
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,718
of colors you see the uh kind of also

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,718
represented here in the upper portion

28
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,160
now the color that you see so the color

29
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,559
that you're interpreting for looking at

30
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,639
this

31
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,238
ladybug here we're seeing a red color

32
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,679
well white light's coming in

33
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,320
and this bug is absorbing many of the

34
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,479
colors

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,759
however red wavelength light is being

36
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,280
reflected

37
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,280
so keep in mind that objects typically

38
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
selectively absorb specific wavelengths

39
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
of light

40
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,320
the color you see is the color or

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,319
wavelength that is being reflected

42
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,519
in the case of a white surface all white

43
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,039
light is coming in and all the

44
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,200
wavelengths are being

45
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,320
also reflected off that surface and we

46
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,079
interpret that as

47
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,279
white coloration so we take a white

48
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,478
light and put it in a prism you can

49
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
separate out into the different

50
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,959
wavelengths

51
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,519
we see start seeing colors we're seeing

52
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:33,759
the color that is reflected

53
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:36,158
now the basics of kind of the spectro

54
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,920
the spectrophotometer is that it

55
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
measures the absorbance of

56
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,478
a solution as light of a specified

57
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,079
wavelength is passed through it

58
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,679
so what does that look like well here we

59
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,398
have a light source that goes through a

60
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,520
lens

61
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,040
and it goes through a prism and

62
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,399
basically separates it out into

63
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,040
different wavelengths

64
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,640
we then have a machine that can select a

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
very specific

66
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,519
wavelength from there so here we're

67
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,040
seeing we're selecting that kind of

68
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,718
yellow wavelength here

69
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,880
then we have our sample solution in a

70
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,640
cuvette and we have a detector and we

71
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,679
have a digital meter

72
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
or display here so we're observing or

73
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
we're

74
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
seeing what gets passed through we know

75
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,479
what the machine knows what was

76
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,959
basically

77
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,840
sent then we're looking at passing it

78
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
through the sample

79
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
and we're detecting to what is basically

80
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,520
passed through

81
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,919
that sample so what does a spectrometer

82
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,239
look like well this is an example of one

83
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,759
here and they have sensors that

84
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,800
determine the amount of a specific

85
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,120
wavelength of light

86
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
is being absorbed by a chemical solution

87
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,360
if no light is absorbed the absorbance

88
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,199
meter will read

89
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,680
0.00 as wavelength is

90
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,199
being adjusted the absorbance will also

91
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
change this will be a difference

92
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,878
in that absorbance reading results can

93
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,239
be graphed to develop an absorption

94
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,399
spectrum for a given

95
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,239
chemical and what does an exorbitant

96
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
spectrum look like this is a very basic

97
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,878
example here

98
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,639
but this simply acts as like a

99
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,719
fingerprint for a chemical

100
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,759
this can also allow for comparisons to

101
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,919
occur since

102
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,759
two different substances to determine if

103
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,280
they're the same substance or if they're

104
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,199
the same substance

105
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
and then known to unknown also for a

106
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,560
chemical comparison there

107
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,959
so based on the absorbance spectrum

108
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
generated will tell us the similarity

109
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
of two substances particularly if two

110
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,039
are unknown whether or not they're a

111
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,239
match

112
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,919
for each other so we're looking at

113
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,080
preparing our chemicals for the spec

114
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,759
analysis chemicals must be in a liquid

115
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
form which may require dilution so it's

116
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,439
important to keep in mind

117
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,878
cuvettes must be used that match the

118
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,799
experiment and there's different types

119
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,280
of cuvettes available

120
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,200
use distilled or tap water depending on

121
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,080
the material you're being tested

122
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,719
keep in mind we often will use just the

123
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,879
kind of

124
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,799
the chemical solvent as what we call a

125
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,878
blank so this is a

126
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
cuvette that just simply has the

127
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,239
chemical solvent which is being analyzed

128
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
and dissolved in

129
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,319
the known or unknown sample and this

130
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
allows kind of for that correction of

131
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,639
any potential data noise

132
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,639
now proper cuvette handling so keep in

133
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,438
mind that because this is such a precise

134
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,878
procedure

135
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,878
we want to be very careful on how we're

136
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,318
handling our cuvettes

137
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,639
we want to ensure that we're using the

138
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,238
proper cuvette materials for step one

139
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,238
and then we also want to avoid direct

140
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,039
contact when handling the transmission

141
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
sides

142
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,679
so when we talk about transmission size

143
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,280
what does that mean well if we look at

144
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,799
our cuvettes example here

145
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
you can see there's definitely two clear

146
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,478
sides and two more opaque sides

147
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,439
the clear sides are the ones that's

148
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
going to be that lights going to be

149
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,319
projecting

150
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,399
through so we want to avoid contact with

151
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,000
those we want to be sure that before

152
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,758
we're placing that into the

153
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,199
machine here we're wiping that cuvette

154
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,040
with tissue paper

155
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
before placing there to ensure there's

156
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,439
nothing on the outside that's going to

157
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
conflict

158
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,040
with the ability to get an accurate

159
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,959
reading of our sample

160
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
and when we're using the

161
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,478
spectrophotometer here i want to follow

162
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,319
the directions since each is unique

163
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,758
however the basics that apply for all of

164
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,240
them is you want to let the machine warm

165
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,919
up

166
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,439
that can be very short duration or very

167
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,198
long duration make sure you're allowing

168
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,879
that sufficient time for that

169
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,160
i want to enter the desired wavelength

170
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,000
that we're going to be studying insert

171
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,919
the cuvette containing a blank solution

172
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,120
making sure the clear sides are where

173
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,279
the light is passing through we don't

174
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
want to insert it the wrong way

175
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,198
and then we want to zero that solution

176
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,800
we want to repeat the basic process

177
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,639
for the samples we first start with the

178
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
blank that kind of controls

179
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000
any of the solvent takes out any of that

180
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,960
noise and then we want to proceed with

181
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
our samples

182
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,239
there some are digital some will have

183
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
knobs some meters

184
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,560
so just keep that in mind there when

185
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,280
we're creating that absorbance

186
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,120
spectrum so with a sample plot the

187
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,918
absorbance versus wavelength

188
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
keep keeping the same sample the same

189
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,399
the wavelengths will be changed and the

190
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
resulting

191
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,719
absorption reading should be documented

192
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,399
so we're noticing as we change our

193
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
wavelength here in this example we're

194
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,679
also having a change in absorbance and

195
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,439
we're documenting that

196
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
the goal here is to determine the number

197
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,240
of peaks the sample may have

198
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,800
which will aid in developing an idea

199
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,759
of specifically what substance we might

200
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,759
be dealing with
