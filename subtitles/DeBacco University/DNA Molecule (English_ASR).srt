1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
okay here we're gonna learn a little bit

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,819
more about the DNA I'll kill you see I'm

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:09,480
inside the characteristic double helix

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:13,469
shape and then as we progress to here we

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,210
see our nucleotides binding together we

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,219
know that this is a DNA molecule because

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,230
the presence of tiny dining to adenine

8
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,269
guanine cytosine yeah but we're gonna

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,189
focus a little bit more as the specific

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,739
binding that's occurring now you will

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,140
notice arrows going from five down the

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,000
three prime and here from again five

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,920
prime pointing to three prime one

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,420
pointing down when pointing up this is

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,399
weird eating it's the termed anti

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,820
parallel we'll talk more about that we

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,439
do DNA replication moving on to the

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,689
double helix molecule what's holding

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,689
these two strands together is actually

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:48,179
hydrogen bonds the hydrogen bonds are in

21
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:51,000
thymine and adenine they are two

22
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,789
hydrogen bonds holding those nucleotides

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,289
together the nucleotides guanine

24
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,300
cytosine are held together by three

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,460
bonds three hydrogen bonds in particular

26
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,659
so all two bonds is strong enough to

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,149
hold the two strands together

28
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,759
of course three bonds are stronger than

29
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,368
two bonds way to kind of remember this

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,380
is C has this curved shape as does a G

31
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,390
they have a similar curve shape

32
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,519
therefore they're bye-bye and tighter

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,228
and stronger so there's three hydrogen

34
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:21,030
bonds auntie remember only has two we

35
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,280
see that depicted here these hydrogen

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,868
bonds hold the bases together where's

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,090
the thymine adenine we see two bonds

38
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:29,129
there's a cytosine and guanine we see

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,170
three bonds keep in mind we can identify

40
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:34,649
this as DNA because of the presence of

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,930
diamine now these Hydra bonds are

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,700
important while the hydrogen bonds are

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,799
biologies weak bond it's a good thing

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,250
that they're weak makes it very easy to

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,780
unzip the double helix for replication

46
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,019
also for reading different genes that we

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,689
want to replicate but then it allows for

48
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,810
an easy reason to kind of store and keep

49
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:57,029
our double helix our DNA structure

50
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,920
together it's very important it doesn't

51
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,290
fall apart because it is the genetic

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,728
information so we want these hydrogen

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,799
bonds to kind of allow to open up a

54
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:07,739
section of DNA to recap here read a gene

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,120
and we want them to kind of reseal up so

56
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:14,280
that we don't lose our DNA structure now

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,489
replicating DNA there's two strands of

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,439
DNA helix are complementary no it

59
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,989
doesn't mean they're identical one

60
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,030
becomes a template of the other and each

61
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,219
can be a template to replicate the whole

62
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,280
molecule what does that mean is where we

63
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,098
have a G it'll be a see down here a seed

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,640
of G and a do it you because in this

65
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:38,219
case we are making an RNA so we usually

66
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,439
call them not identical is it's

67
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,840
complimentary its what is G minor C what

68
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,930
is C minor the G this is why it's called

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,329
a complementary stand this is a template

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,379
strand this is binding here and in this

71
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:55,590
case so this is a double helix of RNA we

72
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:59,399
see to yourselves with no thymine

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,989
present so an interesting note is that

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,640
the ratio of a to T and G to C fix the

75
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,370
stability of the DNA molecule as a

76
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:11,488
mention two bonds versus three months

77
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,129
ATT remember has two months G to C has

78
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,719
three bonds for biotech procedures the

79
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:17,250
more Judas IBAs the higher the

80
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,500
temperatures needed to separate out the

81
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,810
strands we talked about DNA and

82
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,909
separating out a double helix strand

83
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,979
here there's a lot of G and C bonds

84
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,409
there's going to be more or higher

85
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:32,009
temperature required to be to separate

86
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:34,469
that out many organisms that can

87
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,659
withstand high temperatures have many

88
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:41,370
key to see bonds within their DNA

89
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:43,680
molecule lastly here when does our DNA

90
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,109
replicate well it replicates when our

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,180
cells go to reproduce to produce

92
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,000
identical copies here the case of

93
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,269
mitosis and Gami production the

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,060
production of sperm or egg or pollen

95
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,949
grains through the process of meiosis

96
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,239
this is when we're kind of particularly

97
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,969
want to break those bonds and

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,849
reformulate to carry on that genetic

99
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:07,378
information to the next generation

100
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:10,259
whether it be through gametes so the

101
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:12,959
process here of pollen are sperm cells

102
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:16,098
or egg cells or producing identical

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,098
copies of ourselves
