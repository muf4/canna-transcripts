1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
on this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,200
going to go over understanding watts

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:17,118
volts and amps for cannabis production

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,480
in relation to utilizing grow lights

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,079
so you think it's as easy as plugging

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,118
the light in let's go over and

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,198
understanding

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,480
some of the watts volts and amps you

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,000
might have in your grow lights

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,160
so you can be efficient with your

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,879
production so first off

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,119
amps looking at the generalness here of

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,719
the amps refers to the flow

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,199
of the current think of it as the flow

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,960
of water in a pipe the flow rate of amps

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
will determine the available amount of

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,439
electricity to the electrical system

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,719
the number of available amps determines

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,558
the amount of lights that can be

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
operated at one time

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,399
very important if you're in a larger

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,920
grow area to know how many amps can you

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
supply how many grow lights can you

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,559
support

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,398
for your area growers need to know what

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,000
amp service they have available and also

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
what electrical appliances

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,159
they have in addition to the grow room

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,600
lights to know how many lights can be

30
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:08,560
safely supported if or if a

31
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,839
system upgrade is needed so while we

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
think about our lights and that is an

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
important consideration

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
do we have any water pumps also to

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,478
consider do we have any

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,640
other things that are consuming

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,799
electricity that we need to be aware

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
of to don't just think about the lights

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,118
we have humidifier dehumidifier

40
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,239
you know water pumps all sorts of other

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,920
things that may require

42
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,798
electricity we also have extra amps are

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
a good thing

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
so keep in mind that if whatever your

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,079
system is you don't want to push your

46
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,438
electrical

47
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,158
system to the max for example while 1000

48
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,798
watt

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,600
light operating at 120 volts requires

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
8.3

51
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,559
amps growers should allow and calculate

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
as if it was consuming

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000
10 amps as this will reduce the chance

54
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,679
of system overload

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
and increase the reliability of the

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
electrical system so you might be

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
familiar with your panels here

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
knowing how many amps knowing where the

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,280
circuits are

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,280
what's kind of the rule of thumb when

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,079
you go through and calculating this well

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
the general

63
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,759
in general when calculating for a

64
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,159
thousand watt grow light 120 volt

65
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,878
circuit uses 10 amps 240 uses about 5

66
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,759
amps to be about

67
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,799
half the total of amps as the volts

68
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,959
there double

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
also operating any circuit at 80 percent

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
of capacity is a good idea

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
in the sense that it will reduce the

72
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
chance of burning anything out

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
it'll allow some wiggle room in case

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,920
there's increased amount of

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
energy consumption at initial startup so

76
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,719
again it's just

77
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,238
always good to play it on the safe side

78
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,000
don't push it to the absolute

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,680
theoretical max

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,759
so mention volts there let's talk about

81
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,120
them a little bit more volts does

82
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,959
relate to amps so the higher the voltage

83
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,878
the less amps that are needed to operate

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,519
the device but it does not mean they

85
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,159
will cost

86
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,080
less to operate common misconception

87
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,000
when the operating voltage is increased

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
the number of amps or the current will

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
also decrease

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
but the amount of power or watts what

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,439
required will remain

92
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,560
the same so again this is often kind of

93
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,479
this misnomer there

94
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,759
of should i go run on 140 volts or 200

95
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,280
240 volts run it in 240 i'm consuming

96
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,120
less amps as we can see

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
you know right right here if i'm running

98
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
120 volts 10 amps

99
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
240 only five but keep in mind the

100
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,199
wattage

101
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
still a thousand watt light in this

102
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,399
example would still be the same and

103
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
that's what you're charged with

104
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
so again running one versus another is

105
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,559
not going to reduce any sort of

106
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,000
cost when we're looking at energy

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,640
consumption

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,080
so mentioning those watts here watts

109
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,238
does refer to the power

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,680
needed or used most growers would

111
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,959
calculate their growing space and then

112
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,840
determine the number of watts

113
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
needed to sufficiently light that area

114
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
to provide

115
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
50 watts per square feet foot over a 10

116
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,319
by 10 area

117
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,158
the grower would need to supply about a

118
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,479
thousand watts of lighting

119
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,479
just to give you one little math kind of

120
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,039
quick comparison there

121
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,479
now we're comparing watts efficiency so

122
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,840
this is kind of where it comes into you

123
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,878
know a lot of the new lights a lot of

124
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,479
lights are stating

125
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,560
their efficiency which is a great thing

126
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,238
for growers to be able to compare

127
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
so watts can also be used to determine

128
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
the growth space overall efficiency as

129
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,120
many growers will talk in grams per watt

130
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,559
produced

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
to compare different lighting options

132
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,039
the lighting efficiency in terms of par

133
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,200
which is again

134
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,039
photosynthetically active radiation per

135
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,759
watt is often used since this

136
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,479
offers an effective way to compare the

137
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
efficiency of different lighting options

138
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,680
not only looking at the lighting but

139
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,319
looking at the bulbs used

140
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,959
looking at the type or style of lighting

141
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,360
looking at the reflector being used

142
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,039
what type of grow area do their walls

143
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
are their grow tent wells or mylar walls

144
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
or the lenses being used

145
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,799
and what the power supply is all these

146
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
can have an impact there on the total

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,439
watts use efficiency

148
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,040
now what's the both scenarios if grower

149
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,439
has a thousand watt grow light

150
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
in situation one grower has 120 volt

151
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,319
system

152
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,120
they will need 8.3 amps to support this

153
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,599
light

154
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,160
if the grower has a 240 volt system they

155
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,360
only need half of that or 4.16 amps to

156
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
support that light

157
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
so again it's important to keep that in

158
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,879
mind that the

159
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
volts can impact the amount of amps that

160
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,879
are needed but essentially in the end

161
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,638
you're looking at a very similar

162
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,399
watt consumption and that's usually what

163
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,918
you're charged with so that's not going

164
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,279
to reduce your overall cost

165
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,959
and make sure you buy the right you

166
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,239
purchase the right light

167
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,239
for your electrical service

168
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,680
now 120 or 240 volts this gets again a

169
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
lot of attention here of which one's

170
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
better which one should i

171
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,160
choose i don't know this one's reduces

172
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,038
my amps

173
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
so when operating grow room on 240 volts

174
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,360
you can operate twice as many lights on

175
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
the same

176
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,680
amperage than if you're operating on 120

177
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
volts so typically larger operations

178
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,519
will stick with the 240 volts

179
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,519
with either voltage the lighting system

180
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,079
will still require that 1000 watts or

181
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,478
power

182
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,680
so essentially both voltages will cost

183
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,599
the same to run

184
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
with the 240 usually allows growers to

185
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
run a few more lights there

186
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
now keep in mind you just can't buy one

187
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
and decide you're going to flip the

188
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,198
other

189
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,038
there are different outlets so the

190
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
manufacturers have come to a consensus

191
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,839
to make it

192
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
easier to prevent people from plugging

193
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,799
the wrong light into the wrong socket

194
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,478
you'll notice that there's different

195
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,038
shapes to the outlets to prevent you

196
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,599
from making that mistake

197
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,120
now watt hours so companies bills based

198
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
on the watts so

199
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,840
different voltages do not save money

200
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
directly so just keep that in mind that

201
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,799
just because you're using less amperage

202
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
does not mean it's going to cost you

203
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
less

204
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,879
to run so the appliance wattage versus

205
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
the operating time in hours versus the

206
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,360
watts used

207
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
so little calculations here that you can

208
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,439
apply to your own specific lights that

209
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
you might be using

210
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,959
so when comparing watts lights and volts

211
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,559
there are these mathematical equations

212
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,239
just provided you with a couple

213
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
kind of the triangle here is very common

214
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,879
this kind of provides you with the same

215
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
information here

216
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,879
watts divided by volts is amps watts

217
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,240
divided by amps is volts

218
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,759
watts equals volts times amps so again

219
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
just a little comparison there

220
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,280
if you wanted to go ahead and do some

221
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,680
independent calculations

222
00:06:53,279 --> 00:07:00,000
for your own specific growing conditions

223
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
this is the information you would go to
