1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,000
here on this debacco University video

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,080
we're going to go over hemp russet mites

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,240
identifying them and how you go about

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,320
controlling them if you do identify them

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,320
on your cannabis

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,800
[Music]

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,839
plants all right how let's go over how

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
to identify and control hemp russet

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,640
mites on cannabis plants so first off

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,759
that General description and they are

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,960
small just to give you an idea I guess

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,840
we go back here to the actual

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,558
measurements they are very very small

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,719
this is evidence of one right here we

15
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,799
can can see them right here um on the

16
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,160
leaf itself cannabis is the only

17
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,280
reported host for hemp russet mites and

18
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,799
attempts to establish it on related

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,239
plants in the Cannabis basically general

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,839
family canca uh such as Hops and

21
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,439
Hackberry have so far been unsuccessful

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,680
so it's kind of very specific to um hemp

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,039
cannabis while this may not uh be

24
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,159
studied very well there are indications

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,478
that is related to the Tomato russet

26
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,319
might so if you're looking for something

27
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,840
to compare to that might be a source of

28
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,279
at least Initial Ideas uh for methods of

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,640
control hoset mites can likely survive

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,960
year round in indoor production

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,239
environments and possible on outdoor

32
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,919
plants as well as those indoor plants

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,359
hemp mites can crawl only very short

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,000
distances and uh immature stages are

35
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,040
particularly immobile so keep that in

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,560
mind they're going to be a little more

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,360
localized in at those stages however

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,960
adults are capable of crawling fall in

39
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,879
and may move to the edge of leaves where

40
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:36,559
they can then be picked up or carried by

41
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,438
air currents enclosed areas fans can

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,000
quickly spread mites as well so just

43
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,639
because they themselves cannot fly uh

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,680
because they're so small it's very easy

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,879
for them to get picked up uh in wind or

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,560
fans and be dispersed that way indoor

47
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,438
small breezes can distribute the mites

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,519
uh through a field um so indoor we have

49
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,239
those fans outdoor small breezes easily

50
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,840
to spread them even though they

51
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,640
themselves may not be able to fly so how

52
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,439
do we go about a ifying hemp mites um on

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,439
on the actual plant well they can

54
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,118
develop on the upper Leaf surface as

55
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,079
shown in the image uh as you can see

56
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,919
here but the highest numbers are found

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,879
typically on the under side of the leaf

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,559
infestations can result in a dull Leaf

59
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,318
coloration reduced Leaf size and also

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,519
reduction in plant growth kind of see

61
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,399
that stunting going on right here Leaf

62
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,680
Edge curl can be an indication but this

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,560
same visual cue can also be result of

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,959
many other situations so just because

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,598
you have Le Cur doesn't mean you have

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
russet mites but it is something you

67
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:37,318
should be considering and at least

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,319
scouting for when you go about managing

69
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,560
those uh russet mites what should you go

70
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:43,598
about to do to manage them as Industrial

71
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,199
Hemp is relatively new legalized crop

72
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,598
many MDES utilize for specialty crops or

73
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,119
field crops have not yet been registered

74
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:54,158
so be sure to check your local and

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,360
current regulations studies on Citrus R

76
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:58,560
mites in Florida in Israel show that the

77
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,879
interruption of broadspectrum pesticide

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,598
applications for more than 3 years may

79
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,798
increase populations of pricious mites

80
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,959
an industrial hemp making judicious use

81
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,799
of pesticides may be an effective tool

82
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,640
to reduce hemp russet mites oil-based

83
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,640
MDES may have some Effectiveness since

84
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,919
they have been shown to be effective

85
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,839
against spider mites and we talk about

86
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,399
that leaf curl leaves May curl upward

87
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,120
near the pedal so down here we're seeing

88
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,239
relatively normal flat appearance to the

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,360
leaves but we are seeing near that P

90
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,239
pedal near that kind of central portion

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
we are seeing that tendency for them to

92
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,719
kind of upwards can also see the yellow

93
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,560
yellow kind of variegation here on the

94
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,598
edge yellows to the margins Um this can

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,959
also be an indication of potential

96
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,759
nutrient deficiency but also worthwhile

97
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,640
to check with that kind of high-end uh

98
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,759
loop to be able to go through magnifying

99
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,958
glass to check these also for rites even

100
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,399
though they don't have the traditional

101
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
kind of little leaf curl at the pedial

102
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,480
still we're checking that Underside for

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
those very small mites because if you're

104
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,318
dealing with an insect versus a nutrient

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,039
deficiency

106
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,438
that's going to change how you go about

107
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,519
managing your potential issue in your

108
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:09,280
cannabis plant uh in a much different

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,000
direction you want to make sure you're

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,318
putting time and effort into the most

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,360
effective method of correcting whatever

112
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,878
problem you have but it starts with an

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,879
accurate diagnosis
