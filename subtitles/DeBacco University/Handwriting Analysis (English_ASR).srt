1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,198
so hopefully you've been taking some

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,278
notes and you can kind of

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,519
apply some of this handwriting analysis

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,679
to something you recently have written

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,519
to be able to appreciate some of the

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,679
details within your handwriting

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,120
more than you may have realized so

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,320
starting with each person has a unique

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,599
handwriting style if you ever looked at

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,278
your friends or anyone else's you

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,800
probably know this to be true

12
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,480
everyone has natural variations which

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,039
can be due to writing instrument

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,640
mood the age the time restraints

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
audience is writing for you might be

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
sloppy might be

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
messier this could all play into exactly

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,799
the style

19
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
of the particular handwriting you're

20
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,879
looking at so factors that kind of

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,399
in general that will influence

22
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,760
handwriting would be the size of your

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,799
fingers your hands your arms

24
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,558
they're small they're large the muscular

25
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,439
makeup that can be impacted by your

26
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,759
sports or

27
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,199
work or hobbies that you may have

28
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,039
education where'd you learn

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,399
to write did you learn certain nuances

30
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
or details

31
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
style and personality are you in a rush

32
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,319
are you detail-oriented

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,238
these are all factors that influence

34
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,558
someone's handwriting

35
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,759
and when we look at an examination of

36
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,198
handwriting

37
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,000
given an adequate amount of handling

38
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,798
samples there will not be identical

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
features so every person has a range of

40
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
natural handwriting variations

41
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
because no one writes like a machine

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,400
it's not the exact same

43
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,920
font so to speak so this is important to

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
remember when you're looking at making

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,240
comparisons if you're not looking for an

46
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,159
identical perfect perfect identical

47
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,118
match you're looking for some of these

48
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,719
characteristics

49
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,159
and consistencies within these

50
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,519
characteristics

51
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,759
so one characteristic you're looking for

52
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,759
a letter form this includes letter shape

53
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,118
curve slant size continuous stroke

54
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,560
incorrect appearance

55
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,040
typically for this you're looking at the

56
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,320
letters g y h and k

57
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
i can see some examples here of g y h

58
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,478
and k

59
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,799
and how they may look with different

60
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,560
people so the letter form what's the

61
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
curve what's the slant

62
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,799
um is it how far is it slanted what

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,719
letters are slanted

64
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,799
these are just some definitely things to

65
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,519
be looking for the general form

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
of the letters you also have to consider

67
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,478
line of form and this includes the

68
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,438
smoothness of the letters and darkness

69
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,399
of the lines

70
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,758
of different strokes so how are they

71
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,598
writing it can be you know this can be

72
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,439
very messy and you know maybe not be

73
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,719
able to read what name it is

74
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,800
but they'll be again these

75
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,400
characteristics can be carried through

76
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
looking at line form if it's written on

77
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,680
a piece of paper that does have

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,919
lines that can help it can affect

79
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520
certain things as well as the darkness

80
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,479
of the lines and strokes and the pen

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
pressure that the person

82
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,679
may be utilizing we have the

83
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,280
formatting as kind of our last and main

84
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,719
at least characteristic to kind of look

85
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
at we'll go to these in more detail in

86
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,359
other videos

87
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,800
but format includes the spacing between

88
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
the letters the words the lines the

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,480
placement of the words

90
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
and also the margins are there gaps

91
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,439
between the handwriting are there no

92
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,878
gaps

93
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,519
between the words are there gaps or

94
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,439
they're kind of following a margin line

95
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,439
all different characteristics when

96
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,598
you're looking at the handwriting sample

97
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,800
to consider whether it's a match to

98
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,199
something you're trying to make

99
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,719
because they won't be identical how many

100
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,639
of these characteristics match up

101
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,400
and to what degree do they match up will

102
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,399
help you analyze someone's handwriting
