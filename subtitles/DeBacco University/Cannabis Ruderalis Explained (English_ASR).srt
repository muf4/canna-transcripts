00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,799
going to go over and explain some

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,759
explanation to cannabis reuteralis as

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,759
you may know as autoflowers

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,640
[Music]

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,400
all right let's get into cannabis

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,399
reuteralis and a little explanation

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,839
about them so what's their general

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,239
origin well

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,198
these are native to areas of asia

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,719
central eastern europe as well as russia

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,399
rudor alice is believed to be a

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,399
descendant of the indica genetics

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,520
however originally cannabis reuteralis

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,679
was considered a wild breed of cannabis

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,320
so reuteralis is based on its northern

17
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,640
region of origin had to adjust to these

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,399
harsh climates and conditions and the

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
shorter growing seasons this is part of

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
the reasons why it has this

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,440
characteristics that it does

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,359
it has been brought indoors and

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,679
influenced new hybrid varieties and

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,479
continues to be integrated because of

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,878
its auto flowering ability so the plant

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,078
morphology in general uh one to three

27
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,158
feet tall so it tends to be a much

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,599
shorter plant thick and sturdy stems and

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
this is in part because of the harsh

30
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,519
environment you had to endure its shaggy

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
growth pattern and it automatically

32
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,239
flowers after about 21 to 30 days of

33
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,079
vegetation and that can of course be

34
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,879
dependent on the exact type that you're

35
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,280
growing harvest is ready in 70 to 110

36
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,000
days from seed and the buds tend to be

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,359
smaller but well supported by the plant

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,879
so again keep this in mind you're really

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,759
not going to find clones because they

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,359
are flowering based on days old uh

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,200
regardless of the photo period and

42
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,519
that's why for some growers these are

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
considered to be advantageous

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,239
so popular cultivate locations uh for

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,919
these uh the key that reuteralis

46
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,599
flowering is based on that days old

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,879
again and not that photo period so

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,959
they're commonly referred to as what's

49
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,199
called autoflowers they're commonly used

50
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,879
in late plantings in outdoor locations

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,118
mainly due to the naturally changing

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,359
photo periods of the sun their small

53
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,478
size makes them great for indoor or tent

54
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,078
or

55
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,159
growing locations as we see in this

56
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,679
image right here and due to the general

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,280
popularity breeders are utilizing these

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,280
plants to cross with some more other

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
high potency options to create the best

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,719
of both worlds great potency without the

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,319
need of kind of having that photoperiod

62
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,000
dependency

63
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,519
so common realist cultivar is just a

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,759
couple mentioned here lightning

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
autoflower and problematic cbd as well

66
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,679
as many many others as i said they're

67
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,280
being bred into more and more so

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
hopefully this might this explanation

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
provided some good information and

70
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,598
something you're probably going to see a

71
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,598
lot more of
