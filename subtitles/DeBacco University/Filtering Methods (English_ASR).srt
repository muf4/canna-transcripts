1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,719
go here I'm gonna go over different

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,609
types of filtering methods even though

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,049
the basic idea might be the same

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,419
there's different methods to approach

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,160
and that will depend on the protocol or

6
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,469
the materials you're looking at

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,750
filtering but here we have a feed here

8
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,278
we have a barrier and then we have the

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,410
filtrate so we're seeing that these

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,109
larger molecules are being stopped these

11
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,368
falah ones are allowed to pass through

12
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,199
looking at filtration in general

13
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:28,050
separation technique used to isolate

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,539
solids from liquids or gases using a

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,989
selective medium might be most Ameritech

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,770
with coffee and filter paper associated

17
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:39,750
with isolating coffee grounds filtration

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,850
terms the suspension is the initial

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,140
mixture or solution and the fluid that

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,879
passes through the filter is called the

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,439
filtrate and that's what's kind of

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,579
getting through the pores here and

23
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,509
that's ultimately what you're collecting

24
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,189
and they container down below here

25
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:56,218
common forms of filtration will include

26
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:59,009
brewing coffee your kidneys form a

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,289
filtration process very important vacuum

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,019
cleaners are filtering out and aquarium

29
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,269
filters are all again examples of areas

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,728
that you might be familiar with

31
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,469
filtration the filtration methods

32
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,500
there's different methods exist to best

33
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:15,359
match the given as the situation example

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,519
is the solid suspended or dissolved in

35
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,140
the fluid that may influence what type

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,359
of method you choose to use in which

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,420
would be the best to allow the greatest

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,359
extraction at separation in general

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,400
frustration uses gravity to filter the

40
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,009
mixture solids remain in the filter

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,259
while liquid will pass through and might

42
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,599
be further doing some sort of labs like

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
this we're putting the bunch of you know

44
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,559
liquid and solid suspension and then

45
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,310
you're lying overtime to gravity pull it

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,509
through and collecting that liquid below

47
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,030
but there's other forms

48
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,799
so there's vacuum filtration now

49
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,769
Buechner flask and a hose are used to

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,140
create a vacuum here to pull the fluid

51
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,420
through the filter typically with the

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,040
aid of gravity so this is and said if we

53
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,960
were waiting forever for gravity kind of

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,549
pull this through with this set up with

55
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,658
this being sealed here and pulling kind

56
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,000
of a vacuum to some extent you're then

57
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,349
hoping this process along and you saw

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,150
gravity you're still working with

59
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,679
gravity but you're kind of speeding that

60
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,019
up and this is great

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,909
for substances that may take a very long

62
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,680
time to filter if you are just used

63
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:21,389
gravity then we go into hot or cold

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,859
filtration so different temperatures

65
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:25,468
will be utilized if you want to

66
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:28,079
encourage that would be cold filtration

67
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:30,688
or minimize and be consultation crystal

68
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:33,540
formation so if you're looking at you

69
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,888
know heating something up here that's

70
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,539
going to minimize the formation of

71
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,760
crystals if you're going to be using a

72
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,620
cold way here's an ice bath that's going

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,449
to encourage the formation of crystals

74
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,650
through the filtration process then we

75
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,208
get out of different types of filter

76
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,129
paper this is where qualitative filter

77
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,709
paper is used in applications that are

78
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:53,518
routine separation to occur or determine

79
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,739
identifying of those materials and

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,569
there's quantitative used where the

81
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,109
precipitate is to be covered typically

82
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:01,828
with vacuum filtration and to identify

83
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:04,109
specific materials

84
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,409
how are the quantitative filter paper is

85
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:09,799
more precise is more expensive so if you

86
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:12,149
don't need that high level of detail

87
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,609
typically you'll be using a qualitative

88
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,109
filter paper there and they're labeled

89
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:19,049
right on the box qualitative or

90
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,359
quantitative again quantitative used for

91
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,040
specific purposes qualitative a little

92
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,040
more broad-based and less expensive
