1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,599
okay here we're look at the importance

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,798
of documentation cleanliness and

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,740
organization are related to growums we

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,750
see a nice well-organized area here

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,000
where we have documentation not only on

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,800
the door we have it well labeled we have

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,480
a key card to get in we have a

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,589
whiteboard here indicating the plants

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,710
that are in there when they were potted

10
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:25,379
up when they were flipped and when they

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,539
are expected to be harvested and we see

12
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,329
track records right here in a bin

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,210
located right outside this flower roof

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,009
number four great way of having this

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,530
documentation climates and organization

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,179
all wrapped into one here now

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,340
documentation is important because it

18
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,140
should be easy to follow in a logical

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,460
format and it would do much thought and

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,649
should just kind of hit the main points

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,870
here and see a nice organized layout

22
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,058
here a little description initials time

23
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:52,198
and what was done for all tests and

24
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:53,820
times there should be an accompanying

25
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,929
initials to know who was responsible for

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,189
that great way to hold accountability

27
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,840
information should be posted as we can

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,058
see here easy to access going into this

29
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,618
room all people should also be aware of

30
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,019
the location of what's the called the

31
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,909
SDS sheets those are the safety data

32
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,938
sheets for anything that's being applied

33
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,920
good things to consider also if you're

34
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,079
in an area and working to know where

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,700
those are located so that you know what

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,789
products are being applied and it's

37
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,590
important for Health and Safety images

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,150
can also be included as well this can be

39
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,490
another way to go to document things but

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,228
also include captions and use that as a

41
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:31,978
supplement for this written

42
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:34,140
documentation now calendar it's not only

43
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,478
important to document what you do but

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,700
it's also a good idea to know where you

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,340
expect or at least hope to be and when

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,990
so kind of predicting the future you

47
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,368
could see here when these plants were

48
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,890
potted up when they were turned and

49
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:49,469
flipped into from veg to flower and

50
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,670
their anticipated harvest state and also

51
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,390
the number of plants of different

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,159
varieties publicly posted here also with

53
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,200
documentation and binders here that may

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,469
correlate with the room as well this

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,868
could be also ideas of you know the

56
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:05,280
bulbs of the the room how old those are

57
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,649
when they were changed what the

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,159
reflectors are looking like a whole host

59
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,459
of things

60
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,289
irrigation events so much information is

61
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,800
good to collect so that you're able to

62
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:16,620
replica

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,500
a successful pattern or just one that is

64
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,629
not successful Clem this is important it

65
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,009
applies to outdoor field grown plants as

66
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,560
well so don't think it's just for indoor

67
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,000
operations cleaners should be continual

68
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,009
not just once a week Oh every Monday we

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,960
clean no it should be consistent and

70
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,399
clean does that mean sterile listen we

71
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,140
have to take bleach and bleach the walls

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,969
and everything but just going through

73
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,529
and sweeping up collecting everything

74
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,639
and putting in a known location is a

75
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,789
good idea

76
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,159
tools for defined areas is also a great

77
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:46,079
suggestion but there should be steps to

78
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,389
disinfect and limit cross-contamination

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,740
with those tools simple alcohol solution

80
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,289
and keep on hand to be used on a regular

81
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,820
intervals is recommended we see here

82
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:56,689
kind of a sticky paper so when you walk

83
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,769
through this door this captures

84
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:00,900
potentially anything that might be on

85
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,180
the shoes or on the soles here of

86
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,730
individuals Footwear so again something

87
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,680
that should be changed freely on a

88
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,299
regular basis so we're not building up

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,000
and accumulating a bunch of potential

90
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,840
soil particles I'm here keeping the area

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,090
clean as just another step there simple

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,650
hygiene mean yes that is me washing

93
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,060
hands before and during a grow area if

94
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,039
you have a larger area with multiple

95
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,050
rooms repeat the process as you change

96
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,419
from room to room always trying to limit

97
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,670
potential for contamination assume every

98
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,559
room you enter is contaminated even if

99
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,479
it's quote not it'll just keep you in a

100
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,520
good pattern of practice consider

101
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,560
yourself a carrier to disease and you

102
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,390
want to limit cross contamination we

103
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,909
want to limit any direct contact between

104
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,919
rooms make sure you haven't washed up in

105
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,659
between if you've - includes Yourself

106
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,969
tools and guests that might be visiting

107
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,459
your facility here wearing a full-body

108
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:53,400
suit here the booties are the gloves the

109
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,439
hairnet all this just kind of limits the

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,659
chance that I if I carry of carrying

111
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,300
anything I infect the plants that I am

112
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,709
visiting and inspecting the environment

113
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,630
in general continually keep an eye on

114
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,920
the environment around your plants have

115
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,289
a designated area where the leaves are

116
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,449
disposed of and also clean this area out

117
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,400
daily to avoid a source of disease in a

118
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,810
grow space don't have a nice bin here

119
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,340
where all the discarded leaves go and

120
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,620
just leave it here to be changed once a

121
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,168
week go through bag this up and remove

122
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,899
that on a regular basis also you could

123
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,728
have again multiple rooms here multiple

124
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,439
areas of disposal go through and clean

125
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,849
this up insurance isn't breeding disease

126
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,480
it gets picked up in the ventilation

127
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,550
system

128
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,670
and spread to the entire room you can

129
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,960
see a nice clean floor here as well

130
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,220
clean and organized I can see the high

131
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,839
pressure sodium lights kind of tint the

132
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,300
color a little bit but you see down this

133
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,369
whole row very clean it's also easy to

134
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,230
spot potential errors it should be easy

135
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,720
for anyone to follow this clean is

136
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,460
coming this in organization so you know

137
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,750
where you may be missing or running

138
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,789
short of something new treats in

139
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,500
particular one plate doesn't look like

140
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,090
the others what might be going on bureau

141
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,339
issued with the emitters or something

142
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:57,989
going up to watering clean floor also

143
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,399
allows really detection of plant that

144
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,379
may be dropping more leaves than normal

145
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,539
that can just get you to inspect that

146
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,600
plant a little bit more I catch any

147
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,980
potential problems early daily tasked

148
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,480
when it changed Footwear clothing when

149
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,340
entering your grow area to reduce

150
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,980
potential for contamination check all

151
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,560
systems fans lights co2 water so on and

152
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,730
so forth here on there's glasses because

153
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,519
these are high pressure sodium lights

154
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,980
for a grower comfort and also you can

155
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,839
see different sized gloves here to

156
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,910
ensure always changing out gloves with

157
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,560
each room check the plants but also

158
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,120
don't forget to check the undersides of

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,649
the leaves as well they'll just kind of

160
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,360
look at all the tops of the leaves and

161
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,279
these mine flowers are going through and

162
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,040
doing inspections to remove any dead or

163
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,389
sick leaves that you notice Prevention's

164
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,629
better than control keeping the area

165
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,879
clean is a key to disease pest

166
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:47,040
prevention this includes also the blades

167
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,920
of the fan the water tanks the walls the

168
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,290
floor everything we don't want to just

169
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,610
limit it to just checking one thing soil

170
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,990
surface the players to see them the

171
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,300
walls the fans of tools equipment

172
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,639
leaving yourself need to be considered

173
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,400
as far as preventing any potential for

174
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,899
contamination lastly if you do have a

175
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,419
problem room or one that may be

176
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,489
experiencing an issue I just chose this

177
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,080
picture randomly here but if you do have

178
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,210
rooms of various clothing this always

179
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,490
start with the cleanest rooms first and

180
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:16,439
work your way towards the dirtier rooms

181
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,759
or areas there's a help limit the

182
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,029
spreading of disease to your entire

183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,310
operation most people want to go the

184
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:25,109
room that's got all the disease first

185
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,730
take care of that but then that disease

186
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,650
assume is on you and you're transferring

187
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,300
that to your other ones so always start

188
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:33,659
with the cleanest room and progress to

189
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,520
the dirtiest room soon you're not kind

190
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,710
of adding any infection cross

191
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,359
contaminating those spores that might be

192
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:41,069
in the dirty room into your clean room

193
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,170
and all this

194
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,819
taking into consideration is that

195
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,009
connection between the importance of

196
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,409
continual documentation clearance an

197
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,980
organization for an efficient Quirrell

198
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,980
operation
