1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
so i'm going to go over a little bit of

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,150
how we learn and think to give you some

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,219
insight into this

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,219
[Music]

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,519
well first off we may recognize patterns

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,600
or think a pattern

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,759
exists is kind of one way we think we

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,920
can recognize patterns

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,599
which is can be very beneficial when we

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,439
start a car for example

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,879
a certain pattern or sequence we want to

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,719
become familiar with

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,079
so we know when something goes wrong

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,600
patterns can also be essential for

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,759
survival knowing that

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
goes from green to yellow to red lights

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,878
can be very important for safety of us

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,640
and others however sometimes we run into

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,280
issues where we may try to find a

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
pattern

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,359
in one that does not exist or we can run

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
the problem where we

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,719
may fail to see a pattern that does

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,238
exist

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,439
so these are important considerations

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,599
when we're looking at patterns and

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,679
trouble we can get into

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
in addition storytelling can help fill

29
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,679
in gaps for individuals but often

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
stories can go unchecked you want to

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,558
make sure we're fact checking and be

32
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,000
able to back some information

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,959
up the scientific method is a

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,478
kind of ongoing process that requires

35
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,079
observations hypotheses

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,400
and theory testing to develop

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,239
conclusions now how do you relate this

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
well studying three hours

39
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,359
uh once is not as effective at setting

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,599
20 minutes

41
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,560
three times a day for long-term memory

42
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,959
retention

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
which is very important when you're

44
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,319
taking notes during your studying

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,799
you should rephrase and rework the

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,719
material this will help you know

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920
be able to remember it for a longer term

48
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,840
and also develop

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,759
connections with that material you want

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
to review your notes and write

51
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,840
questions when and where did you have

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,640
them now yes there can be moments of

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,719
frustration

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,000
and this is just part of the learning

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,158
process keep

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
at it trust me it'll work out in the

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
long run

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
now there's null and alternate

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
hypothesis so in scientists i mentioned

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
the scientific method

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,759
what about these null and alternative

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,599
hypotheses how do we test these

63
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,840
well the null hypothesis is a statement

64
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,118
of the hypothesis simply not being true

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
and the alternative is the opposite of

66
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,639
that the example here fertilizer will

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,080
not make the plants grow better or

68
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,878
fertilizer will make the plants grow

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
better

70
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,519
we see that listed out here we see the

71
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,919
grass being fed fertilizer

72
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,439
will that help it grow or will it not

73
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,280
when we're looking at

74
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,199
the running a trial we also want to

75
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,759
observe the results

76
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,799
and document those results but when

77
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,439
we're documenting

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
and making observations for results it's

79
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,039
very important that those results are

80
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
only valid if there's a comparable we

81
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,479
call a control group

82
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,399
to make sure the same results would not

83
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,679
occur without the test intervention

84
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,039
for example we had the fertilizer when

85
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
the plants grow well anyway well it

86
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,280
wasn't the fertilizer that made the

87
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
difference

88
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,479
look here how scientists think they have

89
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,760
two main

90
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,759
forms of reasoning the first form of

91
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,840
reasoning is looking at what we call

92
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,919
deductive reasoning this accepts a

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,680
general principle based on observations

94
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,839
so if all humans are mortal and albert

95
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,640
einstein is a human therefore he is

96
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
mortal inductive reasoning is looking at

97
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,679
an observation

98
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
and going to a broader generalization

99
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,719
the poll shows 75

100
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,560
of students at school x takes the bus to

101
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,719
school aaron goes to school x

102
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,719
therefore aaron probably takes the bus

103
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,479
to school it's a deductive reasoning the

104
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,878
premise is true the conclusion must be

105
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,560
true

106
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,719
inductive the premise is true the

107
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:28,878
conclusion is probably true

108
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:28,878
keep in mind these distinctions
