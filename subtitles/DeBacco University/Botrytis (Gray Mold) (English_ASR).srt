1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
all right show me the images here is

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,330
botrytis also known as gray mold and

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:08,699
might be familiar with it on

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,320
strawberries that have gone bad and this

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,178
is kind of what it looks like the zoomed

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,929
in a little bit more almost at the

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,550
microscopic level here but we could see

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,100
that there's clearly an evidence of this

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,899
kind of greyish kind of mold look let's

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,810
make very powdery when touched and it

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,989
can as a result easily spread so this is

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,640
a disease we want to be mindful of so

13
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,649
when we're looking to identify it some

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,320
girls call it bud rot but scientifically

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,079
it is botrytis a scenario and it can

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,320
cause more extensive problems as it

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,840
spreads it spread very quickly in a lot

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,189
of that comes from direct contact the

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,500
indica cultivars tend to be more

20
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,299
susceptible to this disease and it's

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,878
indicated by this white grey see

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,828
fuzzyness appearance at we City can

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,750
create fine dust as released when moved

24
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,480
it can spread the this fungi to

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,058
neighboring plants so early is reducing

26
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,209
one infected tube if you find one sadly

27
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,338
you're going to find that many more

28
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,469
where to look will can affect all plant

29
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:08,989
parts so it's in its evident by that

30
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,640
grade cotton like look on her parents

31
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:13,798
which is evident by Brown and necrotic

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,450
which is dead regions that are occurring

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,520
and we see that clearly evident here

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,320
well it can occur anywhere what's

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,359
commonly found in dense areas of the

36
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,548
plant particularly the buds because kind

37
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,590
of protected there and it needs this

38
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,229
kind of moisture content to be able to

39
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,540
thrive so as a result well technically

40
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,609
occur anywhere looking at these areas

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,710
that are to be protected in areas of

42
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,780
higher moisture content these are areas

43
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,539
typically where it will first appear and

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,129
where you should be inspecting first how

45
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,659
to prevent that well because it's found

46
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,640
in high humidity conditions with poor

47
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,219
air circulation want to avoid these

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,909
particularly conditions to reduce or

49
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,349
discourage the formation of metritis

50
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:55,530
early detection and sanitation are

51
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,539
important because it can spread so

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,310
quickly so the earlier you can find even

53
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,860
small amounts of it the quicker you can

54
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,780
take corrective measures for outdoor

55
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,530
operation avoid overhead watering if

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,450
that's possible

57
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,628
this one is can overwinter and dead

58
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,530
plant tissues or anything that needs to

59
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,659
be removed

60
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,680
don't just put it to the edge of the of

61
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,989
the area your grill

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,170
physically remove it to a distant

63
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,579
off-site location in dealey for control

64
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:23,399
you want to discard an effective plant

65
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,769
debris upon detection have a way to dry

66
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,150
leaves out quickly so on the sides can

67
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,158
be an option but typically aren't

68
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,319
advised especially on the buds because

69
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:34,019
of residuals that could occur so that

70
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,969
key part is the 5-minute remove it dry

71
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:37,408
the leaves out try to discourage its

72
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:40,068
formation in the first place and

73
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:43,699
hopefully that will offer you effective

74
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:43,699
season-long control
