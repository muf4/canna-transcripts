1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,490
okay here I'm going to provide a brief

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:08,220
overview of cellular respiration focus

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,849
mainly on glycolysis kreb cycle and the

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,530
electron transport chain here so the

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,179
quick overview of seller respiration is

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,549
controlled sequence of steps with

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,560
releasing energy from sugars essentially

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,660
glucose is converted back to carbon

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,599
dioxide way to think about celery

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,550
respirations it's the opposite of the

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,830
photosynthetic process celery

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,289
respiration occurs in active cells

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,238
meaning both plant and animal cells in

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,429
the mitochondria the organelle where

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,828
this process takes place so if you look

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,558
at kind of the equation in glucose plus

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,299
six oxygens through the process of

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,839
cellular respiration yields carbon

19
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,089
dioxide water and energy again this is

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,370
occurring in the mitochondria heat and

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,770
ATP or energy are being essentially

22
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,189
released and it's taking in glucose and

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,309
oxygen

24
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,718
okay that's made for the process of

25
00:00:55,308 --> 00:01:00,539
photosynthesis and it's releasing carbon

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,600
dioxide which is then needed or combined

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,030
with sunlight or solar energy in water

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,680
to form the glucose and oxygen that then

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,140
the mitochondria need to use and the

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,140
circle goes around and around so if you

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,310
can memorize the photosynthetic reaction

32
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,728
if you simply put the arrow the other

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,450
way we'll notice we have is the cellular

34
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,739
respiration equation now we're gonna

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,969
take the general sense of this but want

36
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,179
to have you comparison because

37
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,039
respiration occurs kind of in two ways

38
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,159
aerobic in the presence of oxygen or is

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,689
also anaerobic when there's no oxygen

40
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,868
aerobic is when there's oxygen present

41
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:40,649
it's very efficient produces a total of

42
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:43,859
38 ATP's 36 our gain there's a little in

43
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,560
ATP investment there the final products

44
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,719
are water coming outside in 34 ATP

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,540
molecules you might be wondering I just

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,629
said 36 is what we gain for ATP right

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,549
well the final product is 34 to those

48
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,218
ATP's come from the anaerobic portion

49
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,439
initially started when it's aerobic

50
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,978
we're talking to mitochondria remember

51
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:09,118
ATP's are adenosine triphosphate in

52
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:11,550
anaerobic without oxygen we have very

53
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,379
low efficiency morally gaining a total

54
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,719
of two ATP's

55
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,879
implants at ethanol carbon oxide and

56
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,680
four ATP's were produced and this is

57
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,689
kindly called like fermentation we see

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,830
here with the fermentation of wine our

59
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,349
grapes into wine

60
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,170
that's an anaerobic respiration process

61
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,210
in animals you generate lactic acid

62
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,119
their heads sore muscles and feel that

63
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,860
you know sore muscles after a tense

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,409
workout that's because your muscles went

65
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,390
through and generated lactic acid that's

66
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:42,030
an anaerobic process and that acid is

67
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,709
what you feel on your muscles and it's

68
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,509
kind of like sore and you're stretching

69
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,960
and that's what you're feeling it's the

70
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:51,269
literally burnin effect it's an acid and

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,770
anaerobic portion of respiration occurs

72
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,820
in the cytoplasm respiration both types

73
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,040
start out in this with the same

74
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,620
glycolysis glycolysis is the first step

75
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,379
in the breakdown of glucose to extract

76
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,569
energy for cellular metabolism no oxygen

77
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,049
is needed this generates small amounts

78
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,939
of energy

79
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,280
now our glucose can be broken down to

80
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,259
our fructose or a pga tour pyruvic acid

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,509
I'm not gonna get into all the details

82
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,090
here please realize that this is a very

83
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:22,139
complex sequence of steps that's

84
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,180
involved perfect acid which is without

85
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,889
oxygen of fermentation does not yield

86
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,230
much energy it's a take-home message

87
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,750
here most is tied up at the end alcohol

88
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:33,560
or the acid ethanol would be an example

89
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,960
plants convert ethyl alcohol or ethanol

90
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,819
animals produce lactic acid so you can

91
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,490
see here's our ethanol with our floor

92
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,019
plant with waterlogged roots and there's

93
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,700
our muscles after vigorous exercise

94
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,340
we're producing a lot of lactic acid

95
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,469
only 7% of the energy in glucose

96
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,229
molecule is removed in a fermentation

97
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,180
process so there's a lot of

98
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,419
disadvantages there's only two ATP's

99
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,550
gained nad plus becomes fill electrons

100
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,589
quickly can't make more ATP that's the

101
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,689
disadvantages so you millander why would

102
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,009
this even occur in the first place well

103
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,870
there's a couple of meanders in the

104
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:09,239
sense that glycolysis can actually occur

105
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,700
very quickly produce thousands of ATP's

106
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,870
in a few milliseconds it doesn't require

107
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,879
oxygen because it can occur in

108
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,399
environments that lack oxygen so this

109
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,139
availa during ATP's quickly is important

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,819
when you're at vigorous exercise because

111
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,519
your muscles aren't able to get oxygen

112
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,300
efficiently enough so in ordinary

113
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,620
some energy

114
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,000
your body's gonna go through this

115
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,790
glycolysis process

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,110
sadly the aftereffect is that acid that

117
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,610
is produced now when in the presence of

118
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,860
oxygen we have something called the

119
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,470
citric acid or Krebs cycle this is

120
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,020
aerobic respiration 39 percent of the

121
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,510
energy is stored as ATP versus only 7%

122
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:53,289
of fermentation so much more efficient

123
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:55,779
high energy yielding 36 ATP's are gained

124
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,340
for one glucose molecule 602 s are

125
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,319
converted to six carbon dioxide's

126
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,089
and reminders also six water molecules

127
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,180
are produced we have to balance our

128
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:06,519
equation so it's high energy found a

129
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,900
nice little overview movie animation if

130
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:09,939
you want to view that you're more than

131
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:12,939
welcome to this is showing just

132
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:15,699
glycolysis pyruvate oxidation the citric

133
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:19,719
acid cycle how these are all involved in

134
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,279
aerobic respiration lastly for those who

135
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,350
really want to know about the citric

136
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,750
acid cycle or the Krebs cycle and the

137
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,600
complexities this is a image of that

138
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,639
keep in mind because it is a cycle we do

139
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,970
see this kind of rotating event where we

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,349
need to regenerate what we started with

141
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,169
intensive purposes I want you to know

142
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,330
just the general information about the

143
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,560
respiration process and in this video

144
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm not going to get into all the

145
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,680
specifics
