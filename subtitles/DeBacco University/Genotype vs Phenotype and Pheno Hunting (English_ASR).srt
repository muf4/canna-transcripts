1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
okay here we're gonna be looking at

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:06,120
genotype versus phenotype and how

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,489
understanding this difference will

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,960
relate to this term called Fino hunting

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,589
which is often used in the cannabis

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,000
industry so genotype is the genetics of

7
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,679
the organism it's referring to the

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,350
actual DNA sequence the actual

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,608
double-stranded DNA sequence now to say

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,460
what it looks like in its phenotype

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,340
genotype or the actual genetics of that

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,469
organism phenotype is the observable

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,539
characteristics of that organism and it

14
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,549
can be the result of interactions with

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,890
the genotype and the surrounding

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,379
environment so phenotype is how it

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,469
physically looks genotype is referred to

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,719
the actual genetics so we get to this

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,910
term female hunting well it's it's short

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,530
for phenotype hunting this is referred

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,119
to as searching for a particular plant

22
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,579
that is demonstrating a desirable trait

23
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,538
out of a large population so there's a

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:57,179
large population here high degree of

25
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:59,070
genetics high degree of looks and we go

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,820
through a process of selecting for

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,438
certain phenotypes certain

28
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,099
characteristics that we see in a

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,228
particular plant and want to breed that

30
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:14,459
particular trait further and replicate

31
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:17,340
that Sophie no hunting or cloning or

32
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,899
tissue culture could also be used unless

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,969
we have the chosen individual this will

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,159
ensure that multiple plants exhibit that

35
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,658
desired trait so once we feel oh honey

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,670
we find that one that we're really

37
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,530
interested in we then will clone that

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,140
particular one just like a copy machine

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,519
here we see two duplicates in some cases

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,049
it's material can be used for breeding

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,578
to help increase the odds of

42
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,640
transferring one trait remaining with

43
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,309
another so in certain types some people

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,469
will phenotype certain males looking at

45
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,340
breeding there are times that phenotype

46
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:50,009
hunting is for females particular plant

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,478
morphology or a particular or Roma's

48
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,209
produced or something unique or

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,769
different however one word of caution

50
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,539
with phenol hunting is looks can be

51
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:58,649
deceiving

52
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,659
since you're selecting traits based on

53
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,879
phenotypes this may result potentially

54
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,250
for a high degree of variability so even

55
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,319
though two things may look the same

56
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,848
looks can be deceiving as we see here we

57
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,430
only need to have a page that kind of

58
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,829
course perspectives there because two

59
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,960
traits may or look

60
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,570
like or we may see something that looks

61
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,189
like what we want that can be sometimes

62
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,370
deceiving let me go through and

63
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,659
propagate it or breed it further so an

64
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,879
example of this when you fee know if

65
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,199
anything goes wrong there was a time

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,109
when breeder who were looking for to

67
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:35,189
improve bonsai plant diversity and the

68
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:39,630
search was on to find a new bonsai plant

69
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:41,969
in a new small dwarf plant for container

70
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,379
gardening for example many people

71
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,300
thought they hit the jackpot when they

72
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,150
went to the beach because there were

73
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,830
many trees there bonsais size despite

74
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,200
being very old so they able to determine

75
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,360
they had a bunch of these older trees

76
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,179
species that were very small and be very

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,110
conducive to a container garden they

78
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,450
don't want a tree that's going to grow

79
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,130
full size so a lot of breeders took

80
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:04,069
these plants and thought they kind of

81
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,780
hit the jackpot there with finding

82
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,870
varieties that were for whatever reason

83
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,969
old but still very small

84
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,469
the downfall was when these plants were

85
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,599
brought into greenhouses to kind of

86
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,909
propagate they began to show normal

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,949
plant behavior so what was actually

88
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:23,400
happening is all at the beach where

89
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,629
saltwater and a lot of stress winds poor

90
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,310
soils

91
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:30,269
this was actually stunting the trees

92
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,069
giving them a bonsai phenotype even

93
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,750
though they had the genotype to grow to

94
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,189
full size trees and they were brought in

95
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,659
a greenhouse for propagation they were

96
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:39,000
given a better environment and they

97
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:41,159
started growing more normally so again

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,539
this is just a word of caution you know

99
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,430
hunting can go wrong because you're

100
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,429
basing it on the simple hello plant

101
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,739
looks and not based necessarily off the

102
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,790
genes the genotype and phenotype can

103
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,789
sometimes differ
