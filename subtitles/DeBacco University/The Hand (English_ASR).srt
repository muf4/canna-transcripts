1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
okay here we're investigate the hand and

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,799
some of the bones that make up the hand

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,500
and what their proper terminology is and

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,839
also where they're located so starting

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,580
with in general we have the carpals the

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,278
metacarpals and the phalanges

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,129
each hand consists of 27 bones that are

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,839
divided as wrist bones for the carpals

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,939
so we're gonna want to be thinking down

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,640
here our palm bones are actually the

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,890
metacarpals and our finger bones are the

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,390
phalanges we're gonna look at them just

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,160
a little bit more detail but you can see

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,079
that they're color-coded here and

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,939
there's more than one type of Flinders

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,390
called distal and intermediate phalanges

17
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:42,709
and also proximal so those terms of

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,058
being able to understand distal proximal

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,308
still come into play and you see that

20
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,789
theme reoccurring throughout the many

21
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:52,558
units of the skeletal system start with

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,469
the carpals here the eight irregularly

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,140
shaped carpals are the most proximal

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,058
bones of the hand so remember for

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,009
looking at the hand here this still

26
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,829
would be farthest away procs will be

27
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,530
closest to the midline or most proximal

28
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,719
so we're right here in this region this

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,728
would be the carpals there's eight

30
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,560
irregularly shaped bones in this region

31
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:15,959
keep in mind we have our radius in our

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,100
olla down here and just above them they

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,989
articulate with the carpals above the

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,329
carpals we have to give the metacarpals

35
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,819
of the end so this is the five-minute

36
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,280
car polls that indicate approximately

37
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,639
with the carpals and distally with the

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,129
proximal phalanges so they're numbered

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,739
moving a lot early to medial to start

40
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,780
with the thumb which is metacarpal one

41
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,688
I'm sorry which is admit a couple one

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,969
and then end with metacarpal five at the

43
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,798
little fender so we see their numbers

44
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,140
moving laterally starting with the thumb

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,649
region and these are also considered

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,469
areas of our palm last here we have the

47
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,030
phalanges now the digits named in

48
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,298
similar fashion to the metacarpals

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,099
moving a lot of it to the the middle and

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,540
starting with the thumb again so the

51
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,209
thumb again is their starting region

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,368
however we look at this image we see our

53
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,649
distal phalanges aren't immediate and

54
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,590
our proximal phalanges anyway look it's

55
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,229
particularly the thumb region this one

56
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,550
here in particular missing let's their

57
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,189
intermediate phalanges

58
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,790
so the exception is the thumb this

59
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:27,180
contains only a proximal you get in

60
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:29,579
green here and a distal phalange there

61
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,280
is no intermediate phalanges as part of

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,110
your thumb this relaxes intermediate

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,959
foliage the length of the flames

64
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,140
decreases distally so as we're getting

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,810
further away our phalanges are getting

66
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,839
smaller the size or length of those

67
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,640
bones is getting progressively smaller

68
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,519
keep in mind again our metacarpals our

69
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,768
palms located here and our Purple's are

70
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,250
down here articulating with the ulna in

71
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,250
the radius
