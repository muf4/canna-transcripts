1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,528
okay here we're looking at the equation

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:07,830
for photosynthesis which you hopefully

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,150
are becoming more familiar with in this

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,550
video lecture we're gonna go over some

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,650
of the roles of these components and why

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,368
they're needed to be able to carry out

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,810
this necessary process for life so

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,448
looking specifically at the first one

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,219
carbon dioxide is important now carbon

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,439
dioxide enters through the stomata of

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,640
the lead and it's gotta pick a little

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,679
bit of a journey to get to where it's

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,420
needed to be used first it's going

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,890
through the stroma thence diffusing

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,200
through the cell wall and then the

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,210
membrane and into the cytoplasm before

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,380
finally reaching the chloroplast so

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,219
there's a little bit of a process that

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,770
is required now carbon dioxide is this

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,149
source of carbon so all of the lignin

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,660
and carbon sources for the sugars

22
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,910
polysaccharides monosaccharides

23
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:55,459
disaccharides all comes from the carbon

24
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:58,169
of carbon dioxide now as we increase a

25
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,719
concentration of carbon dioxide it'll

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,650
plant may be experiencing we noticed the

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,150
rate of synthesis will also increase

28
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,950
however there's a certain point put a

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,630
saturation here begins to Plateau

30
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,760
here we're adding more carbon dioxide

31
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,368
but our photosynthetic rate is that

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,350
increase in it levels off this could be

33
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:18,259
due to certain limiting factors it could

34
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:20,489
be water the plant could be nutrients

35
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:24,299
there's certain limiting factors that

36
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,709
occur you see in this graph here ties it

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,040
with little bit of numbers our ambient

38
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:30,839
carbon dioxide level is about 410

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,729
ourselves we're kind of in this range

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,259
you can see there is some benefit that

41
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,019
adding increased levels of carbon

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,118
dioxide but then there's a certain point

43
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,030
where our rate just maxes out in

44
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,159
plateaus there so just know that carbon

45
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,868
dioxide is important it's got to be

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,799
diffused to get to the chloroplast and

47
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:52,349
is the source of carbon or this process

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,780
to occur another very important

49
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,118
component is water it's used for many

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,640
purposes in a plant less than one

51
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,909
percent goes to the photosynthetic

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,228
process most goes for cooling or engine

53
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,719
that plants receiving the light they're

54
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:08,128
getting a lot of heat with that through

55
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,919
the transpiration process are able to

56
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,289
cool themselves water is also the source

57
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,469
of electrons which as remember are in

58
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:16,079
the

59
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:19,469
outer shell here these are valence

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,110
electrons of our atom remember in their

61
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:23,189
nucleuses are protons and neutrons

62
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,380
oxygen is a byproduct because we're

63
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,000
going to be splitting water and limiting

64
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,639
water can directly limit this

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,349
photosynthetic process reason being when

66
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,769
a plane is turgid or has enough water

67
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,629
the guard cells open the stomata this is

68
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,300
great cuz it allows carbon dioxide in

69
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:41,219
allows oxygen to leave but in addition

70
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,620
to oxygen leaving water will also be

71
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,419
leaving when a plant becomes water

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,030
stressed this guard cells become

73
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,369
shrunken and close off it's eliminating

74
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,590
water from leading but it's also

75
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,170
preventing oxygen from leaving and

76
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,819
carbon dioxide from entering so this

77
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:59,429
water can directly impact the stomata

78
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:04,139
which can impact the rate that

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,879
photosynthesis can occur light is

80
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,799
another necessary component in light as

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,449
many different wavelengths not all

82
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,330
colors use are used in the same

83
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,909
proportion longer wavelengths are reds

84
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,620
and oranges and are shorter wavelengths

85
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,400
are our violets our Indigo's in our

86
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,300
blues ROYGBIV red orange yellow green

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,260
blue indigo and violet we have our

88
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,959
increase in here and energy with our

89
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:33,539
shorter wavelengths so x-rays in UV rays

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,670
have more energy than to our infrared

91
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,669
rays now we're going to see that the

92
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,579
chlorophyll uses different parts of this

93
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:43,579
particular spectrum so what does that

94
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,750
actually look like this is one of the

95
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,989
graphs and charts that would look like

96
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,129
here so our chlorophyll again this is

97
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,709
the site where all this is occurring

98
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,599
it's a very important component it has

99
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,090
properties similar to human globin in

100
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,799
our in our own bodies chloroplast

101
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,170
structures are aware this is actually

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,450
occurring and there's different types of

103
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,979
chlorophyll chlorophyll a is the

104
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,619
dominant chlorophyll we see here that

105
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,199
represented by the absorbance in the

106
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,890
solid line and we'll notice it's this

107
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,349
blue to kind of dark dark green color

108
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,539
and it drops off we get two greens and

109
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,910
yellows we notice another spike for

110
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,830
chlorophyll I in the red spectrum so

111
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,150
these are the absorption slights now we

112
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,430
talk about different wavelengths are

113
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,469
measured in nanometers this is showing

114
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,050
the specific

115
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,870
that chlorophyll a is is a able to

116
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,520
absorb chlorophyll B allows the

117
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,649
photosynthetic process to occur over a

118
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:39,229
broader spectrum of light as energy is

119
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:41,500
transferred to chlorophyll a now

120
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,910
chlorophyll B is these long dashed lines

121
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,269
and will notice the peaks for

122
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,939
chlorophyll B are close to but different

123
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:51,949
than chlorophyll a what this is allowing

124
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,680
the plant to do is absorb different

125
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:58,399
wavelengths of light in beta-carotene

126
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,709
also is slightly different now plants

127
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,839
are mostly green color because they're

128
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,310
reflecting a lot of that green plant so

129
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,560
it will absorb a lot of that green color

130
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,220
we see you strong in the Reds and the

131
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,839
blues are the wavelengths or the light

132
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:17,240
energy that plants are typically

133
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,409
absorbing at a greater percentage now

134
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,280
the world's compose the electron

135
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,080
transport chain

136
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,969
so our look trying to transport chain

137
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,279
it's non cyclic mean it only goes in one

138
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,290
direction try to put a picture here of

139
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,419
one direction to help you realize that

140
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,450
this particular electron transport chain

141
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,980
is only progressing in one direction

142
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:36,199
where is it occurring well we're back to

143
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,900
our chloroplast it's important to keep

144
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,759
yourself oriented remember the stroma is

145
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:44,449
the aqueous fluid surrounding the Granum

146
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,789
so you see it here and the thylakoid

147
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:50,839
lumen is occurring inside and the face

148
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:53,210
except resented by the red here inside

149
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,099
the actual thylakoid inside those actual

150
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:57,139
discs now we're looking at a

151
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,730
phospholipid bilayer we're going to be

152
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,519
investigating the proteins embedded in

153
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,759
that just because here are thylakoid

154
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,769
lumen is on the lower side and our

155
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,930
stroma is on the upper side don't think

156
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:10,549
that's always the case keep in mind that

157
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,579
these proteins could be down here and it

158
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,990
could flip so just be able to orient

159
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,909
yourself depending what picture that I

160
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,370
give you to keep in mind that the

161
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,950
thylakoid lumen is inside those discs

162
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,720
and the stroma is on the outside and

163
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,839
this electron transport chain that we

164
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,450
see is producing an end product we'll

165
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,099
see in the Calvin cycle for example

166
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,409
things need to be regenerated that's not

167
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,820
the case here it's a transport chain it

168
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,350
occurs only in one direction this might

169
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,599
be a little

170
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,430
using right now and that's okay but I'm

171
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,920
stressing the point it's non-cyclic

172
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,079
electron transport we're seeing our

173
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,840
light energy exciting our electron we

174
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,550
see all these arrows go in one way or a

175
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,829
react setting that electron moving over

176
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,530
here producing an end product

177
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:58,990
this is non cyclic it's called the Z

178
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:00,459
scheme because it kind of psycho Z while

179
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,400
this may seem a little confusing right

180
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,229
now initially if you come back to this

181
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,269
video after watching some of my others

182
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,189
hopefully you'll be able to understand

183
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:12,219
what the photosystems are doing what

184
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:15,279
some of the necessary proteins are also

185
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:19,650
contributing to be able to allow this

186
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,649
necessary process for life to occur
