1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
so this kind of states the obvious

2
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:06,269
question well why test your soil I hear

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,150
a lot of people doing it that's advised

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:11,939
fairly a lot of culturist and

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,388
consultants so well just why should I

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:17,100
test my soil it's something says to ask

7
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:18,750
so it could be simply you just don't

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,670
know about the area it could be a new

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,859
site could be a new field could be a new

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,960
soil could be something you're looking

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,240
at testing or screening and this may

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,039
help you develop a baseline to work from

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,689
and just kind of looking at a field

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,368
looking at an area everything may look

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,890
the same can be a lot of underlying

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,689
question marks here just what is the pH

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,280
what are the nutrient levels on so this

18
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,289
is one reason why you would test your

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,289
soil just to learn about it but you can

20
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,238
go beyond just visual you could have a

21
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,189
problem area so if you're attempting to

22
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,128
use this as a diagnostic tool you could

23
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,929
use sample the normal areas separately

24
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:53,820
and that can act as an area of

25
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,759
comparison so have the picture here of

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,009
the little barn well I notice here is

27
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,659
nice consistent green noticing in this

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,939
area which is lighter coloration

29
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,649
continues into a couple pockets here so

30
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,780
I may want to go through and sample this

31
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,520
area differently than this area to see

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,590
if this is a real problem area related

33
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,118
to the soil or it could be drainage it

34
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,109
could be other things but that could be

35
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,180
another reason why you're looking at

36
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,840
soil testing is investigating a problem

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,549
area could also recheck an area so we've

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,070
had an area that was kind of bad was a

39
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,200
problem area keep the original test with

40
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,569
your records and the additions that you

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,340
added and then retest it's a great way

42
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,899
to determine the trend of your soil are

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,670
you getting to that fair hopefully that

44
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,719
better or improved or that those good

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,549
conditions here

46
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,379
how are the timing of your recheck is

47
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,729
important be sure to a lot of time for

48
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,709
adjustments to have time to be

49
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,170
incorporated so for example if you

50
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,209
notice your pH is low and you add lime

51
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,310
don't go out the next day and test your

52
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,250
soil takes a while for that time to kind

53
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,049
of activate and adjust that pH range so

54
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,180
if you do retest it the you know today

55
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,640
after a week after that might give you a

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,649
false reading for some nutrients

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,810
especially in for pH changes if using

58
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,189
lime want it be careful in a lot of time

59
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,409
for that so it's officially break down

60
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:08,909
retest and then get a more accurate

61
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:11,129
comparison lastly you could test your

62
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,598
soil because someone told you to this

63
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:13,889
means clearly he has good friends but

64
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,329
hopefully your reasons fit

65
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,449
one of the previously mentioned

66
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,280
categories to allow you to have that

67
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,099
information and kind of that self

68
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,509
looking at your soil as a way to improve

69
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,509
your overall crop health
