00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to a succession guided tour

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,160
looking at the progression

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
of secondary succession from soil to

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:17,920
trees here

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:17,920
at tobacco university

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,879
so when we're looking at and comparing

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,599
succession here we're looking at just

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,799
in this overall image and pan can we

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,520
pick out abiotic

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
and biotic factors think about what's

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,880
living

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
what's not living what are we seeing

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,760
overall

14
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,119
and this beautiful look outside of the

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,558
school

16
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:50,159
think of what biotic and abiotic

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,320
factors we see in the image in this slow

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,078
pan

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,679
[Music]

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,439
now here as you progress from the

21
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,479
asphalt blacktop

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,518
walking down this kind of walkway here

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,879
what are we noticing about the area how

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,520
is it treated

25
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,199
and what is preventing or encouraging

26
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,319
levels of succession

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,640
what species are we seeing in this low

28
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,239
growing area here

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,439
how is this species going through a

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,280
change as you work our way down

31
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,118
what's happening in certain areas as we

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,000
work our way further from that asphalt

33
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,519
walkway

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
we're asking about the species here and

35
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,719
how is that changing

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
in addition how do we think the

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,679
progression is occurring where this

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
stone dust is located

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,118
so here we see some stone dust and i'm

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
sure this was all a nice solid path that

41
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,400
stoned us

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,400
how is that changing here over time

43
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,559
now here again we're seeing that

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
progression here we've walked a little

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,600
bit further

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
and we're approaching this tree line in

47
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,640
the distance

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,320
so what's kind of occurring here now

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,718
it's our species changing

50
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,158
what are things looking like here and

51
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,409
how are they different than where we

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,130
last left the stone path

53
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,200
[Music]

54
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:10,239
[Applause]

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,560
this is just kind of a reverse look of

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
where we walk towards the tree line kind

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,280
of give you that appreciation

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:23,170
for what changes might have occurred

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:30,639
over that given space there

60
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:32,639
[Music]

61
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,919
as i pan in this area we notice there's

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,119
a change in

63
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,598
topography in this particular spot

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,719
in addition we see a distinctive tree

65
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,840
line

66
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,120
we're going to go a little bit closer to

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,640
that tree line but what's kind of

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,759
allowing that tree line to be so

69
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:50,039
distinctive

70
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:52,479
in this particular area

71
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,598
[Music]

72
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,598
as you look at this here now that we're

73
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,439
at the tree line we always think about

74
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,119
the species that are located in this

75
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,519
area

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,599
we're getting to that autumn fall time

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
some nice turning colors

78
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,039
but we always think about the species

79
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,799
and we'll kind of get a little closer

80
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,519
we start to look kind of in and within

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
the area here

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,879
so if you come right on that line here

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,560
of that nice open area when we get to

84
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,399
that distinctive line that i talked

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
about developing which is right here

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
we're noticing the change what's

87
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,518
occurring here

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,759
we'll be noticing how the species

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,439
differing are the heights of the plants

90
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,959
differing

91
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,740
by looking at the type of species that

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,280
are differing

93
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,959
[Music]

94
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,959
notice this one growing right out here

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
so these are all important

96
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,479
considerations we're looking at

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,599
succession if you look under

98
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,878
the trees right here we're not seeing a

99
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,280
lot of that grass i

100
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,759
kind of zoom out here a little bit we're

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,680
seeing here's our nice grass line

102
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:02,959
but immediately it abruptly ends

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,519
and underneath those trees you're not

104
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,519
seeing a whole lot of grass in there

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,659
definitely a change so why is that

106
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,840
occurring why is the grass not growing

107
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:15,840
[Music]

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
there

109
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,399
so if you look at the oak tree behind me

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,840
here the question is

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,478
how tall is that oak tree if i'm about 5

112
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,959
10 or so how tall do you think that oak

113
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,279
tree is

114
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,799
and also not how tall how old do you

115
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,239
think that oak tree is

116
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
keeping in mind we have a nice grassy

117
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
area here we have some underbrush

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,689
how old and how tall do you think that

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,960
oak tree is

120
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:42,879
[Music]

121
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,560
now different conditions can lead to

122
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
different forms of succession well we're

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,800
noticing here this area traveled

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,639
quite a bit and that's clearly changed

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,240
the species or what's living

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,199
here so how is what's going on here

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,478
on the fence line changing the species

128
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,600
and how are they going to go about

129
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,038
adapting

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,240
and what's going to come in and kind of

131
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:11,120
fill in this area if we stopped having

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:13,918
people walk down this path

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,560
what's going to change about the infield

134
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,758
if no one was to visit this area for 5

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
10 50 100 300 years

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
what's going to change what's going to

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
be the first species we're going to see

138
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,959
in this area

139
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,198
if you kind of look at a little hint on

140
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,079
the side here can already see some

141
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
species

142
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,918
already starting to kind of take take

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
the first establishment of this area

144
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,000
but what else would occur how quick

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,519
would it occur as well

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
then we also want to be thinking about

147
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,439
not only the infield here

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
we also want to be thinking about the

149
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,038
outfields if you kind of look over by

150
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,860
the scoreboard there in the outfield

151
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:55,199
how's that going to change

152
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,600
[Music]

153
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
so as you walk along the path here we

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
can almost see succession occurring

155
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,599
this area is recently constructed and

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
here immediately following the pathway

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
definitely has a lot of that stone and

158
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,159
gravel

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
and as soon as we start progressing away

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
clearly we see a return

161
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,400
here of a very different set of species

162
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,638
and pinned closer

163
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:21,839
to that main walkway where it was most

164
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,840
recently disturbed

165
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,840
now if you look at this tree that's on

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,478
the edge of the walkway

167
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,560
and we're walking down here we're

168
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,318
noticing the presence of

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,560
lichens so we have these

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,160
lichens living on the tree they're very

171
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
slow growing

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
they're not going to do any harm to that

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,079
tree there but we can see them

174
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,279
definitely

175
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,639
present in great concentration over

176
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,399
on this side here progress around we do

177
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,598
see them present here but not quite as

178
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,879
aggressively growing

179
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,719
this gets a little bit more sun a little

180
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,159
more of a stressful environment when

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,440
we're talking about lichens being able

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,599
to tolerate very

183
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,519
stressful conditions just looking over a

184
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,839
little bit here on a stone

185
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,120
brick wall we can see a whole bunch of

186
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,598
lichens

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
starting to get established right here

188
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,279
as they're progressing down

189
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,360
again a little shadier on this side but

190
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,439
still doesn't have to be a living

191
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,400
host for them to live on here we can see

192
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,000
them doing

193
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,129
just fine and progressing on the side

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,680
of this building

195
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:31,918
[Music]

196
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,519
so here we're looking at some pine trees

197
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,959
and right now i'm pretty far away from

198
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,159
the pine trees and if we look at the

199
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,560
grass

200
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,199
you can see definitely pretty healthy

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,879
looking a couple clover in there

202
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,560
but as i work my way closer to the pine

203
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,639
trees

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
we'll notice starting here the grass

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
starts thinning out a little bit

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,918
starting to notice the grass isn't

207
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,840
looking so good

208
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,079
over here it's getting even thinner

209
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,239
finer

210
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,839
and as you get really close to the base

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,038
of this tree in particular

212
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,560
nothing almost no grass growing at all

213
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,959
we do know some pine needles and this

214
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,478
was recently mowed so how does that play

215
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,359
into the inhibition

216
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,159
of competition how are these pine trees

217
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,319
altering

218
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
the environment directly around them to

219
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
help prevent any competition from

220
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
species

221
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,598
because if i go and pan just a little

222
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,478
bit further away from those pine trees

223
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,159
we clearly see a change that occurs and

224
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,439
that's not that far of an area so

225
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
there's not that much of a difference in

226
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,360
environmental conditions

227
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,439
at least from a large scale so what are

228
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,918
these trees doing

229
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,839
to alter their environment to help

230
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,838
eliminate

231
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
competition

232
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,340
[Music]

233
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
now this area right here was recently

234
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,839
mowed today

235
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,278
and we see on this steep angle here a

236
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,200
little more slipped a little bit

237
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,759
causing a scraping of some of the grass

238
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,360
so since we're looking at succession

239
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,919
we've kind of cleared off this

240
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
area right here where the tire slipped

241
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,159
how is that going to affect what's going

242
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,000
to come in

243
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,159
first how is this area going to be

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,600
restored to quote it's normal

245
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,360
what species are going to be first to

246
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,839
come in so if you kind of look and see

247
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,639
where that grass was pushed off what are

248
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,440
we noticing

249
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,759
what's going to happen here this is just

250
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,040
a

251
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,439
small scale example of how succession

252
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,919
can occur when there's a stress in a

253
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
particular

254
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,519
environment
