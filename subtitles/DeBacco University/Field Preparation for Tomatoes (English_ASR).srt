1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
if you're thinking about turning a field

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,450
into a tomato field I'm gonna go over

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,308
some of the basic field preparations you

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,050
should be considering for that

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,750
particular field to make it an effective

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,670
crop for you so starting with the

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,769
grapple of tomatoes they're native to

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,230
South America so they prefer warm

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,910
weather and a long growing season this

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,260
is why they're not direct seeded in New

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,899
England and they need to be started

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,689
early and translated into the field you

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,768
can also go into season extenders

14
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,810
extenders because these can be helpful

15
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,929
to allow the crop to reach its full

16
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,719
potential so growing site evaluation

17
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,729
well we were looking at a field your

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,399
drain looking for a site that has full

19
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,409
Sun is well-drained and does not have a

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,820
lot of rocks now put an asterisk here

21
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,128
for them not a lot of rocks because the

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,539
plants actually don't mine the rocks but

23
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,030
the person cutting the stakes for

24
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,239
support for those tomatoes will or

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,600
especially if you're using row covers a

26
00:00:53,238 --> 00:01:00,419
less rocky field would be advantageous

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,070
now preparing that field for tomatoes we

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,430
want a well-drained field so they're not

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,560
sitting in a lot of water pH around six

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,659
oh two six eight slightly acidic in

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,460
general nutrient profiles we're looking

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,580
for them to be optimum soil nutrients

33
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:17,339
with special attention for potassium and

34
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,530
maybe calcium now looking at the two

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,210
images of the soil here I can't tell you

36
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,129
which one is better just looking at them

37
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,359
a lot of people would say well this one

38
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,390
looks darker so is probably a better

39
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,009
soil this is not necessarily a bad soil

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,159
this is why it's important to take a

41
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,920
soil test to be able to determine what

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,570
nutrients are in the soil and what level

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,150
they're at we're shooting for optimum

44
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,589
and not excessive

45
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,450
now field preparation for our Tomatoes

46
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,149
there are heavy feeders so starting with

47
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,969
good levels is advised while considering

48
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,590
in seasons supplementation at times and

49
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,450
typically they're grown in rows for

50
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,368
efficient placement of irrigation and

51
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,740
plant supports so while this is a

52
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,090
greenhouses situation here it should be

53
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,489
very similar to a field where they're

54
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,590
nice and neat and organized blind for

55
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,228
efficient treatment of the tomatoes

56
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,030
management of them and able to spot

57
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:08,030
anything that potentially could go wrong
