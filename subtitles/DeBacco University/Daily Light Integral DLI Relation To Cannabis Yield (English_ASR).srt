1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,839
on this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,560
going to go over the daily light

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,359
integral

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,558
typically abbreviated dli in relation to

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,559
cannabis yield

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,678
so now they will be discussing this as

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,119
far as defining it

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,199
i'll also provide you with some

9
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,489
information on how you can calculate it

10
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:24,559
for your grow area

11
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:25,839
[Music]

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,759
all right let's learn a little bit more

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,160
about the daily light integral

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,480
so first off what is it well the daily

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,238
light integral or

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,480
dli represents

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,799
or describes the total number of

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,078
photosynthetically active photons in the

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:45,038
400 to 700 nanometers or par range

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,039
that are delivered to a specific area

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,039
over a 24-hour period

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
for outdoor locations this will be

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,198
seasoned and weather dependent

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,039
and for indoor locations it can more

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,238
easily be calculated by simply knowing

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,079
the light's output

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,358
in the hours that the lights spend in

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,280
the on position

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,879
again for our outdoor locations a little

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,478
bit more of confusion

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,000
in the sense that knowing what season

32
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,079
knowing what location

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,519
knowing where or what degree of latitude

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,118
can also impact this

35
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,560
uh so we've got to take into account a

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,159
little bit more

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
for calculating this for an outdoor

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,359
location now when we're going through

39
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,798
that calculation

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:23,438
process dli is the sum of the

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,118
per second ppfd that's both

42
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,399
synthetically photon

43
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,200
flux density measurements during the 24

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
hour period

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
if the photosynthetic light intensity

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,359
remains constant as with artificial

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,840
lighting units for a defined

48
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,920
time period which is a duration then the

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439
dli can easily be calculated because you

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
have your lights on for a certain period

51
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,039
of time

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,159
producing this amount of ppfd it makes

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
the calculation step

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,399
fairly easy outdoor locations as i said

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,478
more complicated and require more

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,879
data collection over a period of time

57
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,959
however the end result can be the same

58
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,519
we see this kind of calculation of our

59
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,239
dli which is the ppfd times

60
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,798
the minutes or hours and times the

61
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,640
seconds

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
to get times the photo period and then

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
divide it by this 1 million micro

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,238
moles per mole to get to kind of

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
calculate a dli

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,280
but i'll be going through this and

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
giving you a easy

68
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,479
math equation so you can apply it to

69
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,759
your own situation

70
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,399
so when we're looking again at the

71
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,598
outdoor location the ppfd

72
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,159
in micro moles per meter squared per

73
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,199
second

74
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,598
the range is zero to 2000 and that would

75
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,679
be

76
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,199
no light to full sunlight so full

77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,719
sunlight would be that 2000

78
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,119
but remember that sunlight is subjected

79
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,080
to continual variability due to clouds

80
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,599
passing by

81
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
and here we see the time of day at every

82
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,199
10 minute interval taking a reading we

83
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,560
can see a cloud definitely came by here

84
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,479
and we could see getting closer to

85
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
sunset here as the angle of the sun is

86
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,399
changing

87
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,479
for artificial lighting 500 micromoles

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,719
per meter square per second should be

89
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,799
considered the absolute minimum

90
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,919
to ensure when you're growing indoors

91
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,040
you want to be at least

92
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,280
510 really want to be higher than that

93
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,120
so what's how does ppfd versus dli

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,759
what's kind of the comparison here

95
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,800
well for ppfd it's the rate of photons

96
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,280
per second

97
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
way to think about it is how fast is it

98
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,919
raining per second is it kind of a light

99
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,560
little drizzle or is it a downpour

100
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,759
dli would be the sum of photons in a day

101
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
and that would be like asking the

102
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,840
question

103
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,319
how much did it rain today what's the

104
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,759
total so this is how we can compare

105
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,518
these kind of point in time readings oh

106
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
it's rating a little it's raining a lot

107
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,959
to kind of oh how much rain did we get

108
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,639
today that's how we compare

109
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,039
ppfd versus dli

110
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,479
now when we're looking at the target dli

111
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,239
daily light integral

112
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,238
this can vary with the stage of plant

113
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
development however if a grower is able

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,959
to keep all other plant requirements at

115
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
the optimum

116
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,680
dli can be increased above the suggested

117
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
levels to maximize production

118
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
overall yes you want to probably have a

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,480
little bit less light on your clones or

120
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,560
newly emerged seedlings

121
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,479
and increase that as it goes on but if

122
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,158
you think about an outdoor plant

123
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,840
as soon as that thing germinates you're

124
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,239
getting right into that full amount of

125
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,319
sun

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,000
so um we want to make sure we're

127
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,318
reducing the stresses on those

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,759
uh plants but we want to maximize

129
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,518
production you use these kind of as a

130
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,639
minimum we can always increase them more

131
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,039
again assuming

132
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,959
you have all other plant requirements at

133
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,478
optimum

134
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,160
for outdoor perspective on our dli here

135
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,560
we kind of see a little bit of a kind of

136
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,280
comparison here of the different months

137
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
note that summer full sundays dla can

138
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,478
reach

139
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,000
60 moles per meter squared per day the

140
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,918
image shows the amount of light received

141
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,759
across the united states each month

142
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,758
during fall and winter latitude has a

143
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,639
strong influence on dli again

144
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
higher up you are versus the closer the

145
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,960
equator will

146
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,399
greatly impact dli so keep that in mind

147
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,319
that you do have these variables

148
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,519
particularly when growing outdoors or

149
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,279
growing in a greenhouse where you're

150
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,478
dependent on some of the naturals on as

151
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,079
well

152
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,159
now i said there would be calculations

153
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,279
on helping you here's

154
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
an example of one so a plant receiving 1

155
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,239
000

156
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,080
micromoles per meter squared per second

157
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,960
for 20 hours will have a dli

158
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,560
of how much that's the question so the

159
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,478
answer is 72 moles

160
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,600
per meter squared per day so keep in

161
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,199
mind that we're running

162
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
uh lights we're going to keep this

163
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,160
indoors to keep it a little bit easier

164
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,478
at 1 000 micromoles per meter

165
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,080
squared per second for 20 hours so we

166
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,038
start with the output 1000

167
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,079
micromoles per meter per second we're

168
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,159
looking at

169
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,000
converting this to hours so we have this

170
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
many seconds in an hour

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,639
so we're able to cross our units out

172
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,599
there then we want to convert our micro

173
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,840
moles to moles

174
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
so we get at this rate we're producing

175
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,159
3.6 moles

176
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,840
per meter squared per hour so we take

177
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,120
that 3.6 moles

178
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,279
per meter squared per hour and want to

179
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,478
convert that to

180
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,559
the days of the moles per day because

181
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,800
we're running one day is 20 hours

182
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,560
so here's our moles we have 20 hours in

183
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,038
one day that's allowing us to cancel the

184
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,079
hours

185
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,680
out so we're simply left with 72 moles

186
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,918
per meter squared per day

187
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,959
so again how do we go about this we take

188
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,399
our output

189
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,079
and all right we need our output and we

190
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,918
need our time that they were run

191
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,439
here's our output we go through and we

192
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,318
calculate this

193
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,600
and then we go through we take that 3.6

194
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
moles per meter squared

195
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
we are running it for 20 hours so that

196
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
plant

197
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
will have received 72 moles per meter

198
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,478
squared per day

199
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,240
let's look at another example for

200
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,719
running that same thousand micromoles

201
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,199
per second but now only for a 12 hour

202
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
day or a flower cycle how does this

203
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,000
change and of course it would be less as

204
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,038
we expect and the answer

205
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,639
is 43.2 moles so we have our output

206
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,839
in micromoles per meter squared per

207
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,519
second we want to convert this to moles

208
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,519
per hour essentially we go through these

209
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,879
calculations we're still producing the

210
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,240
same 3.6 moles

211
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,319
per meter squared per hour if we flip

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,199
that for just one second we notice that

213
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,400
the output

214
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,000
is the same per hour 3.6 moles 3.6 moles

215
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,439
so how do we get this smaller number

216
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,120
well remember we're only running this

217
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,959
for 12 hours

218
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,280
so we take our 3.6 moles per meter

219
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,879
squared per hour multiplied now by a day

220
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,079
is defined as 12 hours

221
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,598
and that's how we get the 43.2 moles

222
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,120
per meter squared per day for a dli

223
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,560
now how does this light intensity relate

224
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
to cannabis production so we want to go

225
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,519
back and circle back okay

226
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,759
we've got our dli calculated is that

227
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,120
good bad or indifferent so at a certain

228
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,160
point in order for plants to take

229
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,079
advantage of higher

230
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
intensities of light there needs to be

231
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,839
carbon dioxide supplementation

232
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
if light is increased beyond this amount

233
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,119
the co2 becomes a limiting factor and

234
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
plants will not be able to use

235
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,959
extra light levels making it a waste to

236
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
produce typically for indoor situation

237
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,839
you're paying for this light so you want

238
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,280
to make sure it's efficient the

239
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,159
threshold for optimum growth and

240
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,198
photosynthesis

241
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
is a dli of 65 moles per day

242
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
kind of see this kind of like kind of

243
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,520
leveling off error bars here

244
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,199
are at the 95 commons interval for each

245
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,079
treatment we see our dli we see our

246
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,240
yield here

247
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,519
looking at different cannabis strains so

248
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
again keep that in mind we go through

249
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,878
and calculate that's great

250
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,800
do a little comparison really looking at

251
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
that threshold of optimum being 65 per

252
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
day

253
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
so light intensity during veg stage of

254
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,918
cannabis

255
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,639
production so since vegetative phases

256
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,478
can have some

257
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,960
variability do the grow duration of

258
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,639
light to dark to the maximums are

259
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,318
provided below here

260
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
notice that if you have lights that

261
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,639
produce less intensity they need to be

262
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
run for a longer duration while this is

263
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
possible in the vegetative stage

264
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,598
the light duration is fixed in flower so

265
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,680
you want to make sure you're getting

266
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,918
high quality lights to particularly

267
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,879
allow you to maximize that flower time

268
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,439
light dark schedule

269
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,158
in ppfd recommendation without co2

270
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,560
enrichment

271
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,319
looking if you're running a 24-hour day

272
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,239
i give some examples here to try to

273
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
reach that 65 moles per day

274
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,158
we better have lights that are producing

275
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,399
at least 752

276
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,080
micro moles per meter squared per second

277
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
if wearing an 18 6 schedule

278
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
you want to be at 900 micro moles and

279
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,799
still you're going to be closer that 65

280
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
but you're only still going to be

281
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,679
producing

282
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
58 moles per day to the plant for a

283
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,799
flowering photo period comparison that

284
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
12 12 hour schedule

285
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,958
at 900 here we're producing 58 well if

286
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
we're only doing a 12 hour day

287
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,879
now we're only going to have a dli of 39

288
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,399
moles so keep that in mind

289
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,639
the light dark schedule and ppfd

290
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,639
recommendations with co2 enrichment

291
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,799
to reach that target of that 65 moles

292
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,240
per day if you're running lights for 24

293
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,719
hours you only need a light that would

294
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,120
produce 752 micromoles

295
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,480
for if you're running at 18.6 you could

296
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,879
want a light that's producing

297
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
just over a thousand micro moles and for

298
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,519
the flowering photo period we need a

299
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,799
light producing 1505 micro moles per

300
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,200
meter squared per second

301
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,079
so again keep that in mind know what

302
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,120
light intensity you're producing light

303
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,399
intensity during flower phase of

304
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
cannabis production

305
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
so that flowering phases said that

306
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,120
critical flower phase

307
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
since it's defined only as a 12 hour of

308
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,759
a continuous light duration

309
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,639
remains the same what is variable is the

310
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,039
intensity which

311
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,759
impacts the light so we're running for

312
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,759
12 hours

313
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,080
that's a constant the minimum light

314
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,799
level ppfd of at least 510

315
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,200
micro moles per meter squared per second

316
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,240
optimum range without co2 enrichment

317
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,320
would be a ppfd of 800 to 1000 because

318
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
remember without co2 max intensity that

319
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
plants can use is no higher than 900

320
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,800
micromoles per second squared so you're

321
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,159
kind of like limited

322
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,399
capped at that level however if you are

323
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,639
enriching with your row area with co2

324
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,639
ppfd of 1000 to 1500 plus

325
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,679
micromoles per meter squared per second

326
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,439
can be used

327
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,239
does not seem to be a saturation point

328
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,399
even up to 1 800 micromoles per second

329
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,079
so you can theoretically go even higher

330
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,480
than that keep in mind natural sun would

331
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,599
be 2 000 so anything higher than that

332
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
probably not going to get from indoor

333
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
lighting or really at that point and

334
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,480
probably be excessive

335
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,319
so you're trying to determine where that

336
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
light saturation point is

337
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,680
and yes you could give your plants here

338
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:44,799
1500 if without co2

339
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,239
but you're going to be wasting that

340
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,159
light because the plants are not able to

341
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,879
utilize it because in that situation

342
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,240
they would be carbon dioxide limited so

343
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,759
here's just a general quick little

344
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,919
summary reference chart

345
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,439
looking at the hours run looking at the

346
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,278
ppfd produced

347
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
and then kind of trying to get an idea

348
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,838
of the dli is a quick little comparison

349
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
here

350
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
just to give you some idea and this

351
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
darker red region here would be over

352
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,440
that 40.

353
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
again we're shooting for that kind of 60

354
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,920
65-ish range

355
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
so the information presented here i want

356
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,360
to thank a couple people

357
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,200
just to go through and if you're

358
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
interested in this and want to have

359
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
do some more further research i

360
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,679
recommend you kind of search up some of

361
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,599
these names

362
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,759
you might find some very interesting

363
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
publications very interesting articles

364
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,759
some very interesting research and data

365
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
presented to help you make again

366
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,480
informed positions

367
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,519
and ask good questions and to be able to

368
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
understand

369
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,639
this lighting to help you maximize your

370
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,639
plant's yield
