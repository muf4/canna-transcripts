00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,200
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,080
going over using aeroponics to clone

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,759
cannabis

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,839
i'll not only go over some of the steps

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,359
here in a video lecture at the end i

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,119
will actually show you

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,599
uh the process that you would go through

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,949
to utilize this and take what you learn

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:25,210
and put it into action

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:25,210
[Music]

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,518
all right let's get into using aero

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,839
aeroponics to clone cannabis plants

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,799
well first off realize that aeroponics

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,520
you can

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,159
purchase them or you can have a homemade

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
kit

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,519
plants really don't care as long as the

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,399
basics are provided on a consistent

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,079
basis

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,759
to them so there's not great swings or

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
variability as they're going through

22
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,878
this

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,000
propagation time purchase systems offer

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,640
a quick plug and play

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,359
option and have increased upfront cost

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,119
home

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,198
made kits may take a little bit of

28
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,320
refinement to go through to make sure

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,358
you get it dialed just

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,558
in just right easy clone is one of the

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,239
standards

32
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,158
is in the industry it's a very efficient

33
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,719
aeroponic cloning machine

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,400
and i'll use this one as an example also

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,719
on this channel i have a more detailed

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
video specifically going over the easy

37
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,200
clone

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,599
there because it is such an effective

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
system and used on a large scale

40
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,039
so the key step to any aeroponic cloner

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
is you want to have all the equipment

42
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
set up

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
functional stabilized and tested before

44
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,039
you take the actual cuttings a lot of

45
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,600
growers get in wanted to take the

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
cuttings

47
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,399
that should be the very last step you

48
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
want to make sure you have everything

49
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,359
set up ahead of time

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,118
with a system that has several parts

51
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,799
it's possible for a small seemingly

52
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,159
insignificant component to hold up the

53
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
entire operation

54
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,118
give the example here these little

55
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,000
misters if you break one or if it's not

56
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,840
sitting right

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
may not spray right and that could

58
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
affect the entire system so key step

59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,360
have everything set up ahead of time

60
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,359
equipment wise before you even think

61
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,040
about taking your cuttings

62
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,478
then you want to focus on the physical

63
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,359
parts first so make sure you have

64
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,078
everything that is

65
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,438
needed physically set up check

66
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,959
everything make sure all the pieces are

67
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,319
present make sure they all fit together

68
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,239
and make sure they're all working

69
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,718
properly with an aeroponic cleaner you

70
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,478
want to make sure

71
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,399
the pumps working the filters you have

72
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,200
enough foam discs your spray nozzles are

73
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,439
all clean

74
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,598
and also have a drain plug oriented in

75
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,598
the right methods when you're done

76
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,959
it will be easier to take down this

77
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,560
process and this again shows you the

78
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,439
easy clone some of the assembly of

79
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,120
materials

80
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,639
that is required to make it operate

81
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,239
properly

82
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,598
now checking that support equipment so

83
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,878
what's that support equipment well if

84
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,238
you're growing in a grow tent make sure

85
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,919
that's all set up

86
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
the zippers are all working make sure

87
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,159
your lights are functional and hung

88
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:31,359
properly

89
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,919
you got the right bulb in there the

90
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,000
right intensity the right spacing

91
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,958
uh your ventilation makes your fans are

92
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
all working the

93
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
temperature is not getting too hot too

94
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
cold you want to have a water monitoring

95
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,598
system with the water in it along with

96
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,640
any nutrient solutions you might be

97
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,560
adding again just

98
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,079
check all these to make sure they're all

99
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,439
100 functional

100
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
and ready to receive the clones now that

101
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,239
water

102
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,000
and related items that i mentioned the

103
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,840
water quality is the ppm the temperature

104
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,039
the ph make sure those are all dialed in

105
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
that's typically done with a water

106
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,919
monitor here i use the blue lab guardian

107
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,599
monitor

108
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,359
and any water additives here i'm using

109
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,679
the clonex clone

110
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
gel um the gel on the actual plants and

111
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,599
then also the solution

112
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
in the actual aeroponic cloner these are

113
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,158
the general targets that i shoot for

114
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,919
730 parts per million 74 degrees

115
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:22,560
fahrenheit and a ph around 6.4

116
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,919
now put it all together make sure

117
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
everything's running properly

118
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,639
allow for everything to run for a period

119
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,919
of time is also important ensure

120
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,079
everything is stable

121
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,199
and within acceptable ranges your

122
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
temperature might fluctuate a little bit

123
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,158
when that pump's running that pump gets

124
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,559
warm so again make sure everything is

125
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,000
within acceptable ranges

126
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
uh adding the clone is the very last

127
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,840
step and it's probably the most fun step

128
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
but it is the definitely the last step

129
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
plant additions are very at very end

130
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
make sure everything else is checked and

131
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
also rechecked

132
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
the goal is to minimize the transition

133
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,199
time to enter the propagating

134
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,920
supportive environment help reduce the

135
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,000
chance of plant loss and help maximize

136
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,719
your chance at cloning or rooting of

137
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
those vegetative propagated clones

138
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,639
so now they've kind of gone through this

139
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,400
all well let's see in action so here

140
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,929
i'll go through the process and i hope

141
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,028
you enjoy this

142
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,028
[Music]

143
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,919
okay so here i'm going to show you the

144
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
cuttings we took earlier how to get them

145
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,560
ready to go into the aeroponic cloner

146
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,918
so here is one of the clones we took

147
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,519
earlier you can see it's wet because it

148
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,359
just came out of this beaker

149
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,279
full of water to keep it hydrated this

150
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
one doesn't need too much trimming

151
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,799
but we are going to do to try to

152
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,360
maximize the rooting potential

153
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
is i've got some clonex gel here it's

154
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,439
just a breeding hormone it's a simple

155
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,800
oxen

156
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,839
and take our clone we're going to put

157
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,600
that into the gel

158
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,918
you can see now it's got it's coating

159
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,199
with that purple coloration

160
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,639
take our little foam block

161
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,319
foam cube here sorry foam circle

162
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,759
i'm gonna take our little okay take a

163
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,199
little foam circle here

164
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,560
put that around the collar you can see

165
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,520
this area is going to be what's going to

166
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
root

167
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,240
this is going to be the area that's

168
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
going to be rooting and then this is

169
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
going to be the top growth area we're

170
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,030
going to add this to our aeroponic

171
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,879

173
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,199
here i'm going to show you how we go

174
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,159
about cloning a cannabis plant here

175
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,680
so here is one cutting we just took from

176
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,439
the mother or stock plant

177
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
now because we're going to be putting it

178
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,519
into an aeroponic cloner

179
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
we're going to have this foam collar to

180
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,639
put around it

181
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,399
so as a result we do not want to have

182
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,120
anything in that dark environment it's

183
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,359
going to rot

184
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
and have a chance for mold or disease to

185
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,720
develop so we're going to take

186
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,639
this node right here we're just going to

187
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
break that section off right there we

188
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,120
can discard these portions we don't need

189
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,279
those

190
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,399
throw those right in the trash there now

191
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,719
we've got our

192
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,079
clone basically ready to go however to

193
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,199
increase the odds of rooting i'm going

194
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,399
to take some clonex

195
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,160
gel put some of that on the end there we

196
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,079
can see here that gel really sticks

197
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
well to the bottom of that clone that's

198
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,439
where it's going to be rooting

199
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,240
then i go through and i take the foam

200
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,279
circular disc there put that around and

201
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
that's also what's going to hold the

202
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,799
clone

203
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,840
and now we can start to see how this is

204
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,759
going to

205
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,758
increase the odds of a favorable rooting

206
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,400
environment while also keeping the top

207
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,639
growth

208
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,239
uh quite well established there and this

209
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,240
is ultimately going to go into the easy

210
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,839
cloner

211
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,079
you
