1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,779
okay here I'm recovering algae and well

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,269
it may look nice and kind of the

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,209
waterfront here run on the rocks in

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:12,480
Grosse Basin near plants it may not be a

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,360
welcomed guest it's found in most areas

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,460
though that have light exposure itself

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,259
is not a major concern for plants but it

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,060
can encourage other pests to develop

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,090
into the sign of core cleanliness and

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,399
growing conditions you do see that and

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,500
it can be encouraged by over fertilizing

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,049
so we see here with the top of the rock

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,030
wall here very common occurrence but

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,160
that over fertilizing in areas that

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,500
aren't kept very clean will encourage

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,689
this formation that occurs see the

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,350
rockwool cubes in the bath may be kept a

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,718
little cleaner may be newer not showing

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,550
or exhibiting the algae that we see here

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,859
so these could be over fertilized or a

21
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,468
whole host of other reasons this is

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,149
evident that something that were not

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,370
necessarily the cleanest of conditions

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,840
rigor on these plants in the

25
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,570
identification what looks like green

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,460
slime and it's a photosynthetic organism

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,859
so look in areas that get some degree of

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,180
light even if it's not intentional this

29
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,640
could be kind of on the underside of

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,140
something or if there's kind of two

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,209
things like on top of one another it's a

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,790
little like getting in it's an idea

33
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,829
where algae could be growing see see

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,700
this on the large scale here with high

35
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,340
and low tide exposing all areas where

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,439
algae can grow now we're to look

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,570
specifically I typically found in areas

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,179
with high moisture with light exposure

39
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,459
warm temperatures and contain some form

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,500
of nutrients it can grow both

41
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,289
biologically active services as well as

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,150
intimate surfaces so just because

43
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,340
something's plastic or metal or wood

44
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,740
doesn't mean it will not grow there it

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,890
can easily survive on the exterior

46
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:50,519
surface of these materials be careful

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,349
also to inspect the filters as this can

48
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,789
reduce its system contamination a lot of

49
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,078
people will check the lines and check

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,118
everywhere obvious and see there's no

51
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:01,649
algae but their filters contain it

52
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:03,299
circulating water can help that algae

53
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,460
spread even though you think you make

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,259
cleaning the area so also be mindful

55
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,959
check those filters and make sure

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,759
they're also algae free how to prevent

57
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,080
it well the most effective method for

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,949
controlling the plant is to limit the

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,660
light exposure

60
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,060
this is especially important in

61
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,259
hydroponic systems you can see this cave

62
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,818
region where there's light getting in

63
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,250
there's algae and then where there's no

64
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:24,988
light there's basically no algae here

65
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,539
deeper in the cave we see evidence of

66
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,069
that so by blocking out the light you

67
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,109
can easily prevent the algae from

68
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:33,269
forming how to control it

69
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,250
with regular cleanings is recommended

70
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,380
especially if you see or know areas

71
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,430
where it tends to grow be careful what

72
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,810
you're cleaning products you're using

73
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,870
and make sure they're plant

74
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,939
friendly concentrated which is 35% fish

75
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,259
hydrogen peroxide based products are

76
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,719
often recommended because they have

77
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,519
short residual meaning they will go

78
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,949
through and they all kill the algae but

79
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,900
they won't last very long which is good

80
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,060
because it will reduce the likelihood of

81
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,159
you damaging the plants if you do get

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,519
this 35% peroxide I mean I will say it

83
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,620
will turn your fingers white remember to

84
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,659
clean exterior surfaces and also

85
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,789
irrigation lines and water pumps and

86
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,639
also remember check those filters as

87
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,019
well so again that obvious exterior

88
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,669
surfaces but also remember the

89
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,950
irrigation lines any water pumps that

90
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:21,289
many filters all important for a long

91
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,289
term and effective algae control
