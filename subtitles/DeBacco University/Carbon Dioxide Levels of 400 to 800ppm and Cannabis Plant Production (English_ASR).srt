00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,318
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,160
we'll be looking at carbon oxide levels

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,650
of 400 to 800 parts per million

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,339
and how it relates to cannabis plant

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,339
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,320
production

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
okay you're looking at enriching your

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,079
area between 400 and 800 parts million

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,079
what should you keep in mind let's get

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,079
into the video content

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,598
well first off realize that 400 parts

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,278
per million is normal atmospheric

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
conditions and elevating the levels

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,839
above this

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,679
will require the use of several pieces

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,079
of equipment the goal is to

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,600
increase the overall plant yield now

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,878
those pieces of equipment may be the

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
ones including the picture

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,878
or it could be some other but something

21
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,558
is going to be needed to be added

22
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,238
so the equipment list in general is

23
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,159
going to be a carbon dioxide source a

24
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,000
method of delivering that carbon dioxide

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,279
in a monitoring system

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,520
options will be discussed in other

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
videos this video focuses on the chosen

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,280
range and its impact on the plants

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,320
the image that i have here just shows

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,399
what a bottle system might entail

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,439
so first off looking at that 400 to 800

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
parts per million

33
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,280
as the environment is enriched closer to

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
the upper end of this range

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,879
the use of high-powered lights becomes

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,439
more advantageous

37
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,118
under high light the plants become

38
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,199
carbon dioxide limited

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,239
higher light can relate to increase in

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,478
biomass

41
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,519
now here we can see light intensity we

42
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:22,640
can see a relative rate of

43
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,239
photosynthesis

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,920
the key part here is at different carbon

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,478
dioxide levels we can see that there's a

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,040
certain

47
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,679
light saturation point but as we

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,280
increase

49
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,840
the levels of carbon dioxide the

50
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,239
saturation point or the light intensity

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
is increased so if we're only kind of at

52
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,078
the atmospheric or lower end levels

53
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,839
we can get away with lower levels of

54
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,919
light as we increase carbon dioxide

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
plants can take advantage of that

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,879
and increase their photosynthetic rate

57
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,478
so the target range of 480 parts per

58
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,158
million this enrichment level

59
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,599
will cause the least amount of costs

60
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
associated with purchasing carbon

61
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,478
dioxide

62
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,158
no matter what source you choose to get

63
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,759
that carbon dioxide from

64
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
this level is also the easiest to

65
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,000
achieve this

66
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,759
can be the best for large grow areas and

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,478
also small areas that have regular

68
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,920
venting

69
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,520
so you're getting above those

70
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,878
atmospheric conditions and you will

71
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
potentially see that

72
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,840
increase in yield as well assuming no

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
other limiting factors

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
now you want to consider the entire

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,439
environment so again as i said no

76
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,959
limiting factors assuming other plant

77
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,239
factors environment are not limiting

78
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
there will be an increase in plant

79
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
growth compared to atmospheric levels

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,599
what are those other factors to take

81
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,920
into consideration light water

82
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,039
air temperature and nutrient all those

83
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,799
need to be

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,400
optimal and keep in mind when you're

85
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
supplementing carbon monoxide and plants

86
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
might want to grow more aggressively

87
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,759
they may need more nutrients they may

88
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,800
need more water depending how you're

89
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,759
adding the carbon accident you might

90
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,760
want to watch the

91
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,318
temperature the air circulation all

92
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,120
things to take into consideration

93
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,639
now this the cost to benefit ratio so

94
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
there's different systems that can be

95
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,159
set up but a grower must consider the

96
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,639
cost of the implementation

97
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,959
of carbon accident enrichment system and

98
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,359
also the expected rate of return

99
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,878
on that investment comparing a few

100
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
growth cycles of normal atmospheric

101
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,039
conditions can provide a good baseline

102
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
to develop your comparison to determine

103
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,959
is it really going to be

104
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,039
worth it so why would you select this

105
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,199
range of 400 800 parts per million

106
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,079
well this can be in initial range chosen

107
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,158
to check to make sure

108
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,760
all systems are working well with

109
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,399
minimum risk of wasting

110
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,439
carbon dioxide which can get expensive

111
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
often this can be

112
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,519
due to required ventilation to see how

113
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
much carbon dioxide is exhausted and how

114
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,480
easy or hard it is to maintain

115
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,239
levels even at this range also growers

116
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,318
can see just how quote unquote airtight

117
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
their enclosures actually are

118
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,839
it's important if you're planting

119
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,919
autoflowers because

120
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,039
maximizing each day of the limited

121
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,759
growing cycle is

122
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,719
very important so while many growers

123
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,439
will shoot higher

124
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,639
than the 800 part million level shooting

125
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,919
that four to eight hundred per million

126
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,438
can be a great way once you get

127
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,598
everything initially set

128
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,560
to kind of go through any last checks

129
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,639
just to make sure

130
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,479
you're ready if you're looking at trying

131
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,079
different levels or to determine

132
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,959
if this is going to work for your

133
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,959
operation
