1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,569
so you're going to look at some of the

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,729
abiotic issues that impact plants

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:08,369
awesome listed here are like extremes in

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,469
temperatures it is it cold or heat other

5
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:12,058
stresses can be droughts Landy heavy

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,369
metals and a couple others and I'm going

7
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,160
to discuss here and these are a bad

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,198
issues impacting plants these aren't to

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,140
be confused with biotic or living issues

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,850
so all a Vatican non living many of

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,679
these come down a grower error but being

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,539
able to classify plant issues in this

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,149
category can help it develop in the plan

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,609
of Correction and ultimately prevention

15
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,619
going forward these are important things

16
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,019
if you can classify them this can help

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,718
you going forward in avoid making

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,489
mistakes in the future

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,929
also there are nutrient deficiencies so

20
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,119
under fertilizing plans can cause

21
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,399
unwanted stress to the plans which can

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,169
stunt their overall growth individual

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,149
nutrients have characteristic looks that

24
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,820
can aid in identification of what

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,170
nutrient the plant is deficient in so

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,929
it's because the leaves are yellowing

27
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,340
that the leaves are certain color it

28
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,079
depends where they might be located but

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,090
they can help with the identification of

30
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,070
that nutrient so your grower will know

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,500
what to properly feed the plants as far

32
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,899
as food goes to avoid that deficiency in

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,329
the future in the opposite of that

34
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,580
there's also nutrient texas cities often

35
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,920
growers will think more is better and

36
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,629
this is not the case the goal is to hit

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,180
the optimum range of what the plant

38
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,280
needs watch the exact fertilizers blend

39
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,618
or ratios that you're using because it's

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,859
possible for a nutrient to be over added

41
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:31,109
if a grower only focuses on one nutrient

42
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,489
of interest for example fertilizing for

43
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,069
nitrogen and over adding phosphorus

44
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:37,048
sweet example here you're using this

45
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,938
fertilizer for nitrogen work focus on

46
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,829
the nitrogen number moritz nitrogen

47
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,179
phosphorus and potassium if we're

48
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:44,728
fertilizing for nitrogen we could be

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,229
over adding the phosphorous so be

50
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,000
mindful of that don't biscuit lock-ins

51
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:50,399
the walnut ring you're concerned about

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,228
look at the blend in the entire amount

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,149
of fertilizer in all the nutrients that

54
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,280
it contains hit your plant will be

55
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,629
exposed to you want to have kind of all

56
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,430
your ducks in a row and keep everything

57
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:03,629
nice and consistent when we're getting

58
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,368
one way out of whack also sun sunburn or

59
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,259
light burn so sunburn often happens when

60
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:10,020
plants are moved from an indoor to an

61
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,878
outdoor operation are also light burn

62
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,950
this can result when light types are

63
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,689
changed or it can also occur

64
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,848
plant is allowed to grow too close to

65
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,789
the lights I can cause a burning to the

66
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:22,439
plants really damage the leaves and

67
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:25,530
apparently stunts most apical meristems

68
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,120
is growing tips of the plant herbicide

69
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,830
or sprayed image in general if

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,719
outdoorsman spraying an herbicide to

71
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,209
control weeds and the area be mindful of

72
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,039
the potential for drift small droplet

73
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,810
size and wind will increase the odds of

74
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,479
this you can kind of see that occurring

75
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,189
here while the these particular person

76
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,109
spraying just to here we can see the

77
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,098
drift or the carryover the one is

78
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,110
definitely blowing into this direction

79
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,780
because you don't see a lot of sprayer

80
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,700
is going this way for indoor operations

81
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,769
often growers will mix products too

82
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,869
strong or mix them that are incompatible

83
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,129
or they can even make the applications

84
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,009
during full light intensity of the

85
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:01,348
canopy which can also cause damage that

86
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,909
could easily be avoided and its damage

87
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,699
is a physical damage this is why it's

88
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,409
classified as a biotic ozone our air

89
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,789
pollution is not typically a major

90
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:10,799
problem but one it should be taken into

91
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,229
consideration if there's an area of

92
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,090
damage that either it's sudden

93
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:17,129
widespread with other abiotic category

94
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,319
descriptions not fitting with grower is

95
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,329
seeing typically kind of get this white

96
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,548
or this bleached look to the lot of the

97
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,650
leaves this communicating the potential

98
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,870
of air pollution air contaminant or

99
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,180
ozone damage it's going to occur in

100
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,980
indoor or more commonly in outdoor

101
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,290
operations in general if you are using

102
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,818
an ozone kind of method of odor control

103
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:40,469
be mindful it's not functioning properly

104
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,818
there's a function if there's something

105
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,549
that's not going right that could

106
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:47,060
potentially cause some ozone damage to

107
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,060
the plants
