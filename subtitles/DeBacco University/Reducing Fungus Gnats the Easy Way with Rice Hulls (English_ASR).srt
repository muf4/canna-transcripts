00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,640
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,960
going to look at reducing fungus gnats

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,558
with the use of rice hulls we're going

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,000
to go out in the greenhouse take a look

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,399
at some of the plants take a look at the

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,320
rice holes themselves and then go

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,839
through and show you a plant that's

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,879
recently been watered and how quick it

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,839
wicks away the water as a way to add a

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,160
small little physical barrier on the

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:29,559
subscribing substrate to help you reduce

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,560
a common problem through a very easy way

13
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,799
[Music]

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,519
okay if you're looking for a great way

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,718
to reduce fungus gnats using rice holes

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,320
in your containers is one way to do that

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,239
literally as you can see in these

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,640
containers we have a thin coating of

19
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,320
these rice holes now these rice holes

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,520
what they simply do to reduce those

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,238
fungus gnats is by reducing the surface

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,320
moisture in and around the plants by

23
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,558
simply breaking that moisture from

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,799
what's in the growing substrate you're

25
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,679
reducing that pressure of those fungus

26
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,079
nets and therefore eliminating a problem

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,159
through a physical means that really is

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,438
quite easy so if you've never used rice

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,439
holes before you might be wondering

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,599
what's the consistency of them

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,839
well just as you would imagine they're

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,359
very thin they're very light i'm not

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,240
going to apply an outdoor on a really

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,000
windy day but it's this thin and light

35
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,079
property to them that allows them not to

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,159
hold a lot of water and then allows it

37
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,078
to be very dry you don't need to put a

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,560
ton of these around your plants

39
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,639
so just enough to cover that surface

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,118
because it's going to wick and dry and

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,519
then the area below that can be wet and

42
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,400
moist for the roots but this top area

43
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,478
being dry

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,478
really is what reduces your fungus gnats

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,360
so if we look here at our container you

46
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,438
can see we just put just enough to cover

47
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,040
that surface if you look at the plant

48
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,279
here you can see that's the soil

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
substrate right there just enough of

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
those rice holes to cover that to keep

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,199
it nice and dry and that is really

52
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,279
what's going to help

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,759
keep that moisture at a minimum and

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
directly reduce your fungus gnats from

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,159
getting on your plants even from the

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,439
early growings of the plant okay now

57
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,520
here we see a plant that was just

58
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,598
recently watered a little hand watering

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,560
of the small plant and we can already

60
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,238
see those rice holes starting to dry out

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,439
so there is some pockets here they're

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
still holding a little bit of moisture

63
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,800
but again this plant was just watered

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
and we're already seeing that water

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,760
allowed to percolate through drying out

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
those rice holes so this is a great way

67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,399
to want to reduce your chance of getting

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,599
fungus gnats and it's a very simple way

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,599
simply adding rice holes
