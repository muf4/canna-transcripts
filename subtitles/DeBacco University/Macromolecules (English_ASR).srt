1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
so here we're a look at how different

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,849
types of macromolecules are formed it's

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,798
important to realize there's four main

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:10,500
classifications to macromolecules and

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,859
they are DNA and RNA also known as

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,660
nucleic acids proteins carbohydrates and

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:20,939
lipids which also you may know as fats

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,460
so a what is a macro molecule well

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,618
they're carbon-based so they consist of

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,109
a carbon-based core with specialized

11
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,550
groups attached I'll go over some of the

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,830
specialized groups but because we're

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,200
talking here about macromolecules it's

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,839
an organic molecule and here the organic

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,200
is meaning that there is carbon-based

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,790
core to the molecule these groups have

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,770
specialized properties and I referred to

18
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,079
as functional groups so it's a currently

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,090
score as I mentioned here because it's

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,039
in special groups attached what those

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,559
special groups are are functional groups

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,448
and here's a couple main ones located

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,128
right here functional group with a

24
00:00:54,448 --> 00:01:00,030
hydroxyl group the methyl group the

25
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:01,920
carboxyl amino the phosphate these are

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,239
different types of groups and you can

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,549
see they have very distinctive

28
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,368
structures now it's important that these

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,680
structures are defined because these

30
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,228
particular structures will define the

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,990
various properties so hydroxyl group

32
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:19,109
this Oh H attached to R is kind of that

33
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:21,390
a variable group here for example methyl

34
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,868
group this variable chain is attached to

35
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,340
a ch3 this gives you just some examples

36
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:30,239
of some of the functional groups related

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,299
to macromolecules so macromolecules can

38
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,469
be formed or they can be broke down

39
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,930
macromolecules are made by the process

40
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,209
called dehydration synthesis is

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,670
important remember dehydration is the

42
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:44,789
loss of water when we're losing water we

43
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,340
see in O H and H also known as h2o

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,189
leaving and here we now have two

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,799
monomers to single a monomer one one or

46
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,438
two are now linked together by a

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,329
covalent bond so here we have two single

48
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,819
monomers that are now being linked

49
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:02,069
together here this is dehydration

50
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,218
synthesis we're synthesizing or putting

51
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,298
these two monomers together the opposite

52
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,669
of that with a break down our

53
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,520
macromolecules are broken by a process

54
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,469
called hydrolysis here we have our two

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,360
monomers linked together if we're adding

56
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,659
water

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,880
now creating or breaking into two

58
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,849
monomers so you can kind of break this

59
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,400
word apart into hydro lysis hydro

60
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:28,819
meaning we're taking in water lysis

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,490
means to lyse or to cut or to break both

62
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,009
of these processes both hydration

63
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,550
dehydration synthesis or removing water

64
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:39,409
to join two monomers together and

65
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,410
hydrolysis where we're adding water to

66
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,520
kind of break apart this in these

67
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,530
monomers that are linked together

68
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,540
breaking apart that linkage into our

69
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,520
individual monomers both of these

70
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,859
require enzymes and we'll have other

71
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,050
lectures to talk about those but key

72
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,000
part here dehydration synthesis

73
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,480
dehydration removal of water to put

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,669
things together to synthesize them and

75
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,439
hydrolysis taking in water here to

76
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:07,099
separate out into two individual

77
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,870
monomers organisms are primarily made of

78
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,250
four kinds all of macromolecules it's

79
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,530
important to be able to identify these

80
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,870
carbohydrates lipids proteins and

81
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,599
nucleic acids room in a clique as it

82
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,610
includes both DNA and RNA these are

83
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,969
termed macromolecules and they're the

84
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,580
basic building materials in machinery

85
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:28,280
for a cell so we're working our way up

86
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,650
from small atoms to molecules to have

87
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,159
macromolecules and working our way into

88
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,439
these are the primary molecules that are

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,060
used for both the machinery and also the

90
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,060
building blocks for the cell
