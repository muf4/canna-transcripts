1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
here again of the unique opportunity to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,859
see nitrogen deficiency and toxicity in

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,250
a cannabis plant there's a trial that

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,109
was conducted where a plant was fed too

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,388
much nitrogen that's we see the toxicity

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,698
and then underfed nitrogen after you'll

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,469
see the deficiency however the image

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,529
here this is the goal of what we're

9
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,179
trying to achieve here so nitrogen we'll

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,820
just start with the basics why do plants

11
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,989
need it what do they use it for well

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,149
it's a mobile nutrient and that's

13
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:32,609
important when we look at where we start

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,829
to look at we're on the plant where we

15
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,320
might be seeing toxicity or deficiency

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,628
symptoms its sa four amino acids nucleic

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,609
acids chlorophyll coenzymes a whole

18
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,390
bunch of other things associated with

19
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:46,289
the components of plant production

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,359
nitrogen gives the plants that lush

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,879
green color while promoting succulent

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,979
growth in hastens maturity so that's

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,229
kind of giving that plant that nice what

24
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,929
we've determined as growers as a healthy

25
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,939
green color deficient plants exhibit

26
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,009
what we call chlorosis which is loss of

27
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,649
normal green color or yellowing of the

28
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,679
leaves excessive nitrogen can cause

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,530
delayed maturity higher disease kind of

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,720
issues lower tolerance for environmental

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,609
stresses reduce carbon carbohydrate

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,099
reserves poor root development and

33
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,560
difficulty to clone eyes another

34
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,978
negative effect of overfeeding nitrogen

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,750
not to mention costs so this is the

36
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,150
trial that was conducted this is kind of

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,780
a setup here the cultivars users wife

38
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,520
it's a high in CBD plant age is about 80

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,170
days old it's grown in a greenhouse to

40
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,938
help maintain consistent conditions

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,799
control plants were fed a balanced

42
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,429
fertilizer and the test plant was either

43
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,829
fed a deficient amount of nitrogen or a

44
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,259
toxic and that's like super toxic to

45
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:48,989
kill the plant but a bloated appearance

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,629
as you're gonna see with the nitrogen I

47
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,879
was over applied to those plants so

48
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,319
starting with these deficient plants so

49
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,000
it's important when we see leaves that

50
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,349
are yellowing we notice where they're

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,090
located and over here in kind of those

52
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:05,099
red circle we see that lower portion of

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,950
the lead of the leaves is showing that

54
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,989
yellow in color lack of robust growth a

55
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,569
thin overall appearance to the plant

56
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,689
poor green color even throughout the

57
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:16,509
plant but especially

58
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,979
those lower leaves in slow growth so if

59
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:20,289
you're looking at just this image it's

60
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,329
very hard to do that comparison so let's

61
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:24,519
take a look at this plant compared to

62
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,180
what be a normal plant we could see that

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,070
control plant over on this side here

64
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,379
that's how a plant should look if it was

65
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,120
fed of balanced fertilizer now you can

66
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:36,969
really see that lack of vigor in that

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,400
test plant of suspense also has a really

68
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:41,530
yellowing leaves of the on the older

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,390
portions of the plant or that lower

70
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,310
portion of the plant so again it's

71
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,109
really now shows a nitrogen deficient

72
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,009
plant when you compare it to a normal

73
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,900
plant the same age now look to look for

74
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,699
specifically as I said those yelling of

75
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,580
the leaves notice how the upper leaves

76
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,709
here as a normal green color on the

77
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,180
older leaves are yellowing this is a

78
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,550
plant that's exhibiting it kind of a

79
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,340
more advanced form of nitrogen

80
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,469
deficiency and we can see that here that

81
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,750
the green color is being pushed to that

82
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:12,580
newer growth because nitrogen is a

83
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,889
mobile nutrient it's moving from the

84
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,200
older and being translocated through the

85
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:20,708
plant to the newer growth that we see

86
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,988
here now if you're growing tomatoes

87
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,879
they'd kind of do the same thing yelling

88
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,129
with those older leaves same symptoms as

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,930
cannabis this was an extreme case where

90
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:30,579
only the very top of the leaves the

91
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,770
plant have much green color to them at

92
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,890
all and it plays a very spindling look

93
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,750
to it in general as well seedlings can

94
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,669
have early symptoms of low nitrogen we

95
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,680
can see that here there's a yelling of

96
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,449
those older leaves in that greening of

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,580
the upper leaves here this problem

98
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:49,209
should be corrected now to avoid stress

99
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,760
during the transplant in field

100
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,459
conditions this can be more common if

101
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,620
after prolonged heavy rains particularly

102
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,390
in sandy soil that will flush out a lot

103
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,060
of that nitrogen here we see a heme

104
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:03,099
field here the bud regions the upper

105
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,800
portions green but those lower regions

106
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:08,259
definitely that yellow coloration

107
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,239
if notice only near harvest time near

108
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,039
the end of the season not necessarily a

109
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,509
bad thing because you want that last bit

110
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,759
of nitrogen to push through the plant

111
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:18,699
and it's a sign that you do not over

112
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,899
feed those plants with nitrogen now how

113
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,909
to correct a problem

114
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,199
well whole host of fertilizers are out

115
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,300
there I've just kind of mentioned a

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,860
couple here with the advantage of just

117
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,490
about all nitrogen fertilizers is

118
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,650
they're very

119
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,110
acting so typically the ones added

120
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:34,269
wanted into the root zone you should see

121
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,120
a plant change in as little as three

122
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:39,279
days so all the rates suggested here for

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,819
about a two by two growing area we have

124
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,619
blown a blood meal urea calcium nitrate

125
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,889
and ammonium sulfate are the most common

126
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,199
ones blood meal one tablespoon per area

127
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,288
corporate into the soil and water Danis

128
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,538
ki it's organic the downfall is it is

129
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:57,490
kind of costly but in three days you'll

130
00:04:55,538 --> 00:05:00,389
see the plants green up if you did have

131
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,590
a nitrogen deficiency urea

132
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,720
three-quarters of a teaspoon per gallon

133
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:06,668
of water it's a very potent this is 46%

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,659
nitrogen compared to blood meal that's

135
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:09,818
only 12

136
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:11,379
that's very concentrated source you can

137
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,658
volatize or you can lose a lot of that

138
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,519
nitrogen to the air if not incorporated

139
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:17,348
into the soil and keep in mind if you

140
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,240
are making the soil applications of urea

141
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:21,610
the soil should be warm about 50 degrees

142
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,030
Fahrenheit + or 10 degrees Celsius or

143
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,970
greater calcium nitrate is 15 and a half

144
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,698
percent nitrogen one tablespoon per

145
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,830
gallon of water highly water soluble but

146
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,840
it can increase the soil pH if used at

147
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:36,908
high rates or over an extended period of

148
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,089
time so just be mindful of that unless

149
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:41,918
they have a Mon iam sulfate here 21% in

150
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,228
nitrogen half a tablespoon per gallon of

151
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,319
water reduces leaching and authorization

152
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:49,389
but it can acidify the soil so this had

153
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,098
a corrected deficiency but what does a

154
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:53,530
Texas City symptoms look what happens if

155
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:56,079
you over apply your calculations here

156
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:58,989
well looking at the over applications

157
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,508
this is what a toxic level of nitrogen

158
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,189
can look like you have excessive growth

159
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,979
a very dark green color to the leaves

160
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,379
and brittle stems plants can also be

161
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:11,168
very difficult to clone so again here we

162
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,069
see that very dark lush green growth now

163
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:13,598
how does that look compared to the

164
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,430
control plant that same control plant

165
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,589
from before you can now see that

166
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,509
comparison how much darker that green

167
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,978
color is there's a green door and a

168
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,270
white wall in the background kind of to

169
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:24,430
kind of color balance things a little

170
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:25,990
bit we can definitely see that darker

171
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,860
green color with this excessive nitrogen

172
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:34,240
a very dense canopy as well and that

173
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,069
just excessive growth there now

174
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,870
the toxicity how to correct that well

175
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,528
simply how to correct it is to know what

176
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,228
fertilizers you're adding and how

177
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:44,449
to add and as growers not to over adder

178
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:46,158
if it says a tablespoon and don't do one

179
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:48,199
and then a little bit more they want to

180
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:50,538
calculate what you're adding and learn

181
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,218
what the normal plant and color looks

182
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:54,079
like so that you know if you're over

183
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:55,639
adding or under adding they mentioned

184
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,259
before nitrogen is very quick acting

185
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,749
which is great because you do have a

186
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,879
deficiency you can easily correct that

187
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:04,759
so hopefully this helps you kind of

188
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:08,929
understand the nitrogen problems on

189
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,919
toxicity or on the divisions end you can

190
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,748
check out other videos out in this

191
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,248
channel to help you understand potential

192
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:15,249
deficiencies in your plants
