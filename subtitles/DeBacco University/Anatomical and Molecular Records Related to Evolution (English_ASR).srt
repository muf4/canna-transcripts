1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
so here i'm going to go through some of

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,519
the anatomical and molecular records

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,439
related to evolution

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,959
think of it as some of the macroscopic

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
and some of the microscopic

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,880
records related to evolution first off

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,960
we have the

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
presence of vestigial organs the

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
structures that are no longer in use

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,160
such as the human appendix

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,439
and wisdom teeth apes have much larger

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,879
appendix that's involved with the

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
digestive process

14
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,480
we have these structures and we can

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,919
easily live without them

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
this is evidence that they may have been

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,118
used at one time and now for born

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,159
without them

19
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,159
we have no negative effects molecular

20
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,279
records will evolutionary distance is

21
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,238
one for example

22
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,120
new alleles arise by mutations that come

23
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,599
from

24
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,878
predominance through favorable selection

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,239
so in this case we have this kind of

26
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
population before

27
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,558
after selection we have the favor of the

28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,799
red circles instead of the yellow

29
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,640
this could relate to the resistance

30
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,359
level of something going on in the

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
environment

32
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,920
we also have the example here for

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
whatever reason the dark gray is favored

34
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,799
over the white coloration

35
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,719
so we have this change over time

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,840
now we look at specifically these

37
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,920
molecular records

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
and this kind of divergence that is

39
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,439
occurring we can look at kind of

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,879
degrees of divergence or how dissimilar

41
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,158
two species may be

42
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,599
evolutionary changes involve the

43
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
continual accumulation of genetic

44
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,239
changes

45
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,520
distance related organisms accumulate in

46
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,920
greater number of evolutionary

47
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,200
differences and closely related ones

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,439
this divergence is seen among

49
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,478
vertebrates in the 146 amino acid

50
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,239
hemoglobin

51
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,840
beta chain so what does that kind of

52
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,239
mean we're looking at hemoglobin which

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,359
humans

54
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,798
monkeys dogs birds frogs and even sea

55
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,920
lampreys have

56
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,520
seeing the amount of amino acids that

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,478
are different between this hemoglobin

58
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,239
polypeptide

59
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,920
compared to the human so in this case

60
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,039
the monkey has eight

61
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
difference the dog is 32 the bird is 45

62
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,719
the frog

63
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
67 different amino acids and then the

64
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,599
lamprey 125.

65
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,199
this indicates that while all of these

66
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,399
organisms have hemoglobin

67
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,280
lamprey is by far the most dissimilar

68
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,159
because of its high degree of variance

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,280
and the

70
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,039
frog and the bird are more distantly

71
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,719
related to humans than the dog or the

72
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,239
monkey

73
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,840
and we're looking at our molecular clock

74
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
and the difference between these

75
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,959
the same pattern of divergence is seen

76
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,679
with dna sequences

77
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,920
such as that of the cytochrome c gene so

78
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
what does this kind of refer to and mean

79
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,280
well here we have millions of years in

80
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,759
nucleotide

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,759
substitutions well changes appear to

82
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,598
accumulate at a consistent rate

83
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,799
this phenomenon is referred to as the

84
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,560
molecular clock

85
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,959
this means these mutations are occurring

86
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
at a relatively consistent rate

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,000
different proteins evolve at different

88
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,080
rates so the more complex we have

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
the least amount of differences compared

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,719
to the greater amount of differences we

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
have here so here we have again the

92
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,959
human the pig the duck snake

93
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,639
uh fish and moss species in yeast we

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
have this large divergence here

95
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,199
so looking at the molecular clock the

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
degree of uh nucleotide substitutions

97
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,719
that are occurring

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,439
over this period of time we're seeing

99
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,158
some sort

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,439
of consistency to that pattern over a

101
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,318
long period of time

102
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,000
indicating this molecular clock we've

103
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,598
also something called homology

104
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,360
so the eyes of these organisms are not

105
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,919
homologous that's the first kind of key

106
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
point

107
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,439
but the genes controlling the eyes are

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
homologous

109
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,959
so let's kind of look at this in more

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
detail when we are comparing the genetic

111
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,158
similarity to

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
to protein similarity of an eye control

113
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,639
gene

114
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,319
across species that's what we're looking

115
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,479
at in specifics here

116
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,919
the mouse is the comparison standard so

117
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,439
for example

118
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,280
the genetic similarity and the protein

119
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,039
similarity so protein scenario

120
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,318
to the mouse between the eye of the

121
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,239
mouse the shark the squid in the flat

122
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,639
room is all a hundred percent

123
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
however what's different is the genetic

124
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,399
similarity to the mouse

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,919
so this gets into genotype and phenotype

126
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
so genetic similarity to the mouse the

127
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,399
charcoal is eighty-five percent the

128
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
squid seven

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,239
a little over seventy eight percent

130
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,759
flatworm 71.6

131
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,438
so we're seeing that there is some

132
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,318
genetic variability

133
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,199
even though this protein is consistent

134
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,958
throughout

135
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,119
so this indicates remember there's

136
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,640
multiple uh

137
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
multiple ways you can make the same

138
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,959
protein get to the same amino acid with

139
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
different genetic code different rna

140
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,680
essentially

141
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
within this molecular record looking at

142
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
500 million years ago an ancestor

143
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,800
involved switch

144
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
for eye development so probably simple

145
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
type of eye

146
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
one pigment cell one photoreceptor this

147
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,959
gene was passed on to its descendants

148
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,120
these descents involved

149
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,039
more complex eyes well if we have this

150
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
kind of light and dark sun single that's

151
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
one way

152
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,879
but if there's more complexities being

153
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,879
developed

154
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,719
this is a way that that gene can be

155
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,120
modified to development of

156
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
kind of the complexity to the eyes for

157
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
example that we have

158
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
we can sense a lot more than just light

159
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
and dark we have lenses

160
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
um colors there's a lot of complexity

161
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,519
just within the eye

162
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,439
this again shows that kind of basic

163
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,879
there's nerve fibers and photoreceptors

164
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,319
while getting to development of a retina

165
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,038
getting built with cornea development

166
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,279
lens

167
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,719
being able to kind of sense objects at

168
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,399
different distances

169
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
being with night vision depending on

170
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,679
what animal you're looking at

171
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,839
a lot of complexities here

172
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,079
looking at dinosaurs as well we could

173
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,839
see this high degree of complexity

174
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,199
that is occurring in divergence between

175
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,198
them all we have

176
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,879
definitely a change that occurred where

177
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
a lot of them went extinct

178
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,319
so why did that happen you know what

179
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,478
they clearly did not

180
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,000
best fit that environment but this just

181
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,159
shows you that progression over time

182
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
now molecular evidence we have dna dna

183
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,919
hybridization it's called where dna is

184
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,280
separated with sufficient heat to create

185
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,439
single strands

186
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,959
these uh then closely related sequences

187
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,800
will join together or what we call

188
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,079
hybridized they'll stick together more

189
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
strongly since there are more

190
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,639
complementary bases

191
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
so you can't take the dna we kind of

192
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,360
separate it out we see what it may stick

193
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,280
to

194
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
the closer the sequences are related the

195
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,799
higher the melting

196
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
temperature the tm will be required to

197
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,759
separate those

198
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,000
this is just a kind of a way to tell

199
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,720
this hybridization how similar the

200
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,759
genetics may be because if they're more

201
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,319
similar they're going to be bound

202
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,560
tighter

203
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,960
and take more heat to get them to

204
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,319
separate out

205
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,839
now whale evolution something else to

206
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,600
kind of look at the evolution of whales

207
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,519
beginning with their

208
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
ancestor their descendants of

209
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,478
terrestrial animals

210
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
return to the sea this is another

211
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,279
example of

212
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,198
evolution doesn't mean getting more

213
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,198
complex necessarily

214
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,038
whales distant relatives may have been

215
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,199
land-based with walking

216
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,279
and they may have slowly reduced those

217
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
limbs to become more flipper-like

218
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,038
and to become more fin-like to be able

219
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,680
to best fit the aquatic environment

220
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,159
versus the terrestrial one

221
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,038
there's a lot of evolutionary critics

222
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
the

223
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,478
seven principles of objectives that they

224
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
have here it's not sadly demonstrated

225
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,159
there's no fossil intermediates

226
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,959
there's intelligent design evolution

227
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
violates the second law of

228
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,519
thermodynamics

229
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,680
proteins are too improbable to form

230
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,680
all these objections are really without

231
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,918
a great scientific

232
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
merit when you start looking at them to

233
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,680
be kind of supported

234
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
a lot of people bring up religion

235
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
related to um evolution this is just

236
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,038
looking

237
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,639
at um pope john paul the second november

238
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,159
19th 1996 some

239
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,478
an address that he made regarding

240
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
evolution because the catholic church

241
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,318
and evolution tend to be thought to be

242
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
very much conflict

243
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,240
so he stated that today almost half a

244
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,038
century after the publication of the

245
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
euclidean

246
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,879
new knowledge has been led to the

247
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,959
recognition of more than a hypothesis

248
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,319
in a theory of evolution it's indeed

249
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,318
remarkable that the theory has been

250
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,759
progressively accepted by researchers

251
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,598
following a series of discoveries in

252
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,598
various fields of knowledge

253
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,759
he goes on to say the convergence

254
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,478
neither saw nor fabricated of the

255
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,598
results

256
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,639
of work was conducted independently and

257
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,319
is itself a significant argument in

258
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,160
favor of the theory

259
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
so keep in mind this is a theory uh but

260
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
in science theory is a very well

261
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,478
established well-supported

262
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,478
um idea or concept versus a theory that

263
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,918
we may be familiar with more

264
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,918
in common everyday world
