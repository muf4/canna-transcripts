00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,919
welcome back to another debaco

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,719
university video

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,240
here looking at different types of glass

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,199
and we see three general categories

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,280
provided here

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,119
annealed tempered and laminated along

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,480
with some properties listed below them

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,439
but we're going to go into even more

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,278
detail here so first starting with well

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,880
how is glass made well glass is a hard

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,640
brittle amorphous which means

12
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,278
it's molecules lack organization

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,399
material so it's made from fused

14
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:31,039
inorganic materials by melting sand lime

15
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,238
and sodium sodium carbonate at very high

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,239
temperatures

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,759
this varies in elemental form again

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,839
depending what type of glass

19
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,359
and as a result many shapes and colors

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,120
can be derived

21
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,719
in glasses we see here with all the

22
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,119
various birds

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,679
and various ornamentals of glass and

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,519
here's the manufacturing process as well

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,119
so sodium soda lime glass so this is the

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,079
most common type of glass which accounts

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,919
for 90

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,679
of manufactured glass so if you're

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,359
finding this type at a crime scene

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,600
may not be the best at kind of getting

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
into this very something very specific

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,599
but it can still provide other valuable

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
trace evidence by linking someone to a

34
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,839
crime scene

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,359
the reason why it's so common is it's

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
found in window panes beverage bottles

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,040
and light bulbs

38
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,239
has a density of 2.44 grams per cubic

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,200
centimeter

40
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,239
then we have a borosilicate glass this

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
melts at a higher

42
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,640
temperature than typical silicate glass

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,079
so it's used in cookware and lab

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,239
equipment such as beakers

45
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,118
where high heat tends to be involved

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,158
it's also known

47
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,599
by its trade name pyrex since 1915

48
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,799
and that's what a lot of the beakers

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:37,919
here are made of or even this

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,920
measuring cup here we see pyrex listed

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
right in the center it has a density

52
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,359
very similar to the sodium lime glass at

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,079
2.23

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,000
grams per centimeter cubed then we have

55
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,599
leaded glass so this is fine glassware

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,478
and decorative art glass called crystal

57
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,478
lead glass

58
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,478
sometimes it substitutes lead oxide for

59
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,280
calcium oxide or lime

60
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,519
to make it a little bit more

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,079
environmentally friendly the addition of

62
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,679
lead oxide makes the glass denser and as

63
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,879
light passes through the more dense

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
glass the light

65
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,239
waves are bent and this gives the glass

66
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
that sparkling

67
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,919
effect so really important for its

68
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
visual characteristics

69
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,159
but now can also be used to tie in when

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,680
you're collecting it potentially as

71
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,000
trace evidence

72
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,319
we also have tempered or safety glass so

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,199
this is stronger than ordinary glass by

74
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,199
introducing

75
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
stresses to rapid heating and cooling of

76
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,159
the glass surface

77
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
when tempered glass breaks it doesn't

78
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,439
shatter but rather fragments or dices

79
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,840
into small squares

80
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,239
with little splintering it's used for

81
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
side and rear windows and automobiles

82
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,920
sold in the united states keep in mind

83
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,439
it's the side in the rear

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,119
and if you look at it through a

85
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,560
polarizing lens or if you're wearing

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,759
sunglasses and then them kind of tilt

87
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
your head a little bit to one side or

88
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,479
the other

89
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,000
you can kind of see that kind of

90
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,119
temperature safety glass it has a

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,239
certain look to it

92
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,719
particularly looking here at the rear

93
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,439
car window now in support i said side

94
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,400
and rear

95
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
a cart window because a laminated glass

96
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
is the glass used

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,719
on the front windshield and limited

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,479
glass

99
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,318
derives its strengths by sandwiching one

100
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,959
layer of plastic between two pieces of

101
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,799
ordinary

102
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,239
window glass the windshields of all cars

103
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
manufactured in the united states are

104
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
constructed of this

105
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,878
laminated glass because as a result we

106
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
can kind of see here

107
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,039
it doesn't shatter and break through it

108
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,318
kind of fractures but stays together

109
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,000
which is very important for the

110
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,000
windshield so nothing's coming at the

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,680
driver or passengers

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
then we have bulletproof glass and as

113
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,239
the name implies looking at resisting

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,799
the impact from bullets

115
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,799
it achieves this by a combination of two

116
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,040
or more types of glass one hardened one

117
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,719
in one soft the softer layer makes the

118
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,919
glass more elastic so it can flex

119
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,919
instead of shattering

120
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,759
the index of refraction for both the

121
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,598
layers must be very similar though

122
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,199
this is to keep the glass transparent

123
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,039
and allow a clear view

124
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,280
through the glass this is why looking

125
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,878
this glass in particular very quickly

126
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
won't be you won't be able to quickly

127
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,759
identify it as being bulletproof or not

128
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
because it should look

129
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,598
like normal glass the bulletproof glass

130
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,200
does vary in thickness from three

131
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,280
quarters of an inch to three inches and

132
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,158
that can depend how many layers there

133
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,318
are

134
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,239
this is a rough kind of depiction here

135
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,158
bulletproof glass composed of layers of

136
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,640
plastic sheeting which would be the gray

137
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,319
and then layers of actual typical glass

138
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,839
and that would be the blue

139
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,000
that will resist depending how many

140
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,798
layers the caliber or the force of

141
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,519
impact

142
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,039
how much will it resist that bullet

143
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,279
that's coming at it

144
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,439
then we have optical or flint glass and

145
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,279
this has a high refractive index on raf

146
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,719
1.45 to 2.0

147
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,000
a disposal poses a pollution problem for

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,919
older glass

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
manufactured of this type because they

150
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,000
tend to contain lead to oxide

151
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
now titanium dioxide and zarconium

152
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,399
dioxides are used making it less of an

153
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,720
issue

154
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,239
while still maintaining its great

155
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
optical properties

156
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,639
also used to make simulated diamonds it

157
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
has this very clear

158
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
high refractive index light dispersion

159
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,319
here in the image

160
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
above me is looking at the mercury vapor

161
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,918
lamp in a prism made of

162
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
flint glass again that really high

163
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,599
optical quality

164
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,199
and lastly we have mirrored glass and

165
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,919
this is glass that's been treated with

166
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,439
metallic

167
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,959
substances creating mirror-like

168
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,839
properties this can

169
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,038
be so we can be able to see ourselves in

170
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,119
the morning

171
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,240
this is just another type of mirrored or

172
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,918
reflective glass

173
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
and all of these have the potential to

174
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,758
be found at a crime scene

175
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,039
so now that you're well versed in them

176
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,479
when you're picking up these pieces of

177
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,360
trace evidence you can make these

178
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,000
connections

179
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,439
potentially identify the type of glass

180
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,839
and where it might be found at a crime
