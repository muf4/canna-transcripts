1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,678
have you ever wondered how growing

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,640
substrates can impact chemist plant

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:05,839
production

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,679
well here in this video we're going to

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,359
look at a scientific article and do some

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,160
comparisons of some common growing

7
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,480
substrates

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,920
and just see how they do impact cannabis

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
plant production

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
[Music]

11
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,399
all right welcome to this tobacco

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,399
university video let's get into how

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,358
growing substrates impact cannabis plant

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,439
production

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,880
so for as always here is the article

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,238
here's the citation here's the first

17
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,479
page there's the link to it

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,679
where you can always find more details

19
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,279
of the experiment

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,759
this can provide you with the highlights

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,960
here so first off the substrate

22
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,479
composition what are the different

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,120
subjects that were looked at in this

24
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,000
study

25
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,280
you're going to see terms like pm g30

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,878
and cc

27
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,840
pm stands for peat mix g30 stands for

28
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,718
peat mix substitute with 30 green fiber

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
and cc stands for pure coconut fiber

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,079
and you're also seeing the term the

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
abbreviation i should say

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,759
dap and that stands for days after

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
pollination

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,280
the pot size during experiment in cm is

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
provided right here

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
these experiments were conducted between

37
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,000
march 4th 2019

38
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,879
to april 9 2019 and you can see kind of

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,599
the details

40
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,959
of the con components of each of the

41
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,798
substrates

42
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,478
so what's the mean or average plant

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,118
height of the

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,640
genotypes studied so in the detail in

45
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,079
the details of the study there are some

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,439
more specifics provided

47
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,319
but here we're just looking at the

48
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,000
substrates this line or dotted line here

49
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,599
represents the vegetative growth

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
and then the generative growth this is

51
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,640
usually a lot of girls call this the

52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
flowering phase

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
and we will notice that overall the

54
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,759
growing

55
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,799
plate trend and plant height measured in

56
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
centimeters

57
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,200
and we see this physical difference here

58
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,239
so when we're looking at the comparison

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
kind of what ended up

60
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,280
overall being the highest for plant

61
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,478
height

62
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,519
was the pem followed by the g30 followed

63
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,118
by the

64
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,438
cc and as a reminder here the pm

65
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,759
is that peat mix that g30 is that peat

66
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,079
mix substituted with 30 green fiber

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
and that cc there is the coconut so you

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
could see again how that comparison

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,719
occurred over the days after planting

70
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,159
now what does the actual plants look

71
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,759
like so this is kind of a good just

72
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,959
general comparison here if you looked

73
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,359
all the numbers that's great

74
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,959
but what do the actual plants look like

75
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,000
not only the plants as we see here in

76
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
the above image

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,159
but also the root structure of each and

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,920
we can see some differences here

79
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,598
coconut fiber causing the greatest

80
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,479
degree of kind of spacing out of the

81
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,079
roots the

82
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,919
greatest area of surface area of

83
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
coverage and the peat mix plus 30

84
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,958
green fiber showing a little bit more

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
denser pockets

86
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,280
in regions there we could see also how

87
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,919
that impacted the plant growth here on

88
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,919
the above

89
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,159
portion of the plant which growers

90
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,679
typically most associate with

91
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,039
so what's the research conclusion so we

92
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,560
saw the data we saw the pictures what

93
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,280
did the researchers actually have to say

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,199
after

95
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,759
doing this study they said that there

96
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,439
was a limiting effect on the cbd in cba

97
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,518
content enacted by the different

98
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,120
substrates could not be confirmed so

99
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
that means that one substrate didn't

100
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,560
necessarily

101
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,759
produce any higher cbd or cba in the

102
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,598
plants that were studied

103
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,000
so it can be concluded that the use of

104
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,839
organic green fibers to partially

105
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
replaced fractionated peat showed

106
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
genotype specific

107
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,840
option for consistent plant development

108
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,598
a comparable high biomass yield and

109
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,039
stable cannabinoid content

110
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,878
compared to a standard peat containing

111
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,039
standard mix there so what does that

112
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,878
kind of mean well a lot of times when

113
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,560
growers are changing different

114
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,158
substrates they're going to wonder how

115
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
that's going to impact the plant

116
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,759
and this is a study here looking at

117
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
specific cannabinoid content

118
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,598
and really they concluded that there

119
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,079
wasn't really that much of a difference

120
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,598
there

121
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
in the cbd and cba content extracted

122
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,759
from

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,439
the plants so that's important as

124
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,359
growers when we're looking at potential

125
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,959
cost or potential

126
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
for changing different substrates or

127
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,360
manufacturers are changing different

128
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,000
substrates how's that going to impact

129
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
our plant

130
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,840
specifically a cannabis plant this is a

131
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,158
great study here that shows

132
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,080
some information in graphical form as

133
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,158
well as the morphology of the above

134
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
plant structure as well the below plant

135
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,919
structure so growers can get a better

136
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,719
understanding and a controlled study

137
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,359
of how their substrate may impact their

138
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,359
plants
