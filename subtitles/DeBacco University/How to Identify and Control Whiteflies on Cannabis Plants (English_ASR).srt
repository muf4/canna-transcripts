1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
on this debaco university video going to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,120
go over how to identify and control

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,278
white flies

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,278
if you identify them on your cannabis

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,399
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,480
plants

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,439
so kind of a unique look here at some

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359
white flies

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,198
this video is going to focus on how to

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,080
identify them control them

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,679
on cannabis plants so first off the

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,439
description of white flies well white

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,000
flies are piercing and sucking insect

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,880
that feed

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,439
on the plant's sap they can develop

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,359
quickly

17
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,199
in warm weather and they can mass

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,878
multiply you want to inspect the

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
underside of the leaves for the actual

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,479
insects as you can see here

21
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,320
and you can also inspect for the small

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,078
dots which are the eggs

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
which will show just the pressure that

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,480
is to come for

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
white flies on your cannabis plants now

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,238
identification

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,000
of white flies well luckily white flies

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,519
are large and typically easy to spot

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,198
with regular inspections

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,079
they're not super small like some other

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,599
insects are they feed on young plants

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
this can cause leaf curling

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,478
and plant distortion because they're

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,840
just basically piercing and sucking so

35
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,760
it's going to cause that plant

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
to take on that kind of crinkled look

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,200
another reason for concern is the

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,960
potential for viral transmission

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,478
via white flies being the virus vector

40
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,239
kind of general feeding you can see that

41
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,400
kind of stippling on the leaves here

42
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,839
flipping this over would likely reveal

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
white flies

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
so how do you go about managing white

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,679
flies well white flies can quickly

46
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,840
develop a resistance to pesticides

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
so this should only be used if there's

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
an initial large population

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
to kind of reduce or knock down their

50
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,759
numbers before implementing

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,199
another method of control then those

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,560
that other method of control should be a

53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880
biological control

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,879
such as the pirate bugs and green lace

55
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,640
wings here you see part bugs feeding

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,319
on the larvae of larvae of white flies

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,239
they can be in effect of control at

58
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,319
least if they're established early

59
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,158
when populations are small and that's

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,519
why if you have a large population you

61
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
can catch it early

62
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,798
knocking that down with pesticides

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,439
potential option but really

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
utilizing these beneficial insects is

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,118
what's advised

66
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,719
because it requires no chemical residue

67
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,719
or applications to your actual cannabis

68
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,719
plants
