00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
in this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,040
video we're going to see cloning from a

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,280
damaged plant so it can live on let's

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,280
see two plants that have endured some

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,359
physical damage and we're going to take

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,518
some clones from them that we may not

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,519
have considered otherwise first one got

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,839
damaged the top so we're going to kind

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,439
of top top that one and utilize that

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,039
plant material the one in the image here

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,320
that fell over we're going to see just

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
how many clones you can get from our

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
branch now while they may not all root

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,399
at least taking them and giving them a

15
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,719
chance to root would be encouraged

16
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,519
because this is a great way to continue

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,320
those genetics on a situation that might

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,320
be a little unfortunate

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,920
[Music]

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,320
so this

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,120
cbd plant was unfortunately trampled by

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,878
a mixture of both people and bunnies and

23
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,399
so we want to be able to salvage

24
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,640
anything we can from this so that we

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
don't just lose the entirety of what was

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,239
damaged by people and by

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
animals

28
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:04,878
so

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,760
typically like i said you want your

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,400
plant size to be about a hand but due to

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,040
the damage that it's endured we can't

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,439
really take the snipping right at the

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,280
node we want it to be a healthy somewhat

34
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,679
healthy plant

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,680
and so

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
instead

37
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,719
we're gonna cut it above the node still

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,359
pretty close but above so that there's

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,280
no damage in

40
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,000
right here

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,799
so now hopefully we could take what's

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,920
left of this damaged plant and repurpose

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,920
it into a new hopefully healthy plant

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
and allow this plant that has been

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,399
damaged to take less stress off of

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
trying to fix the damage on top and put

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
its nutrients into the rest of the

48
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,639
leaves so that hopefully it can recover

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,640
from this injury

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,560
so unfortunately this plant endured a

51
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,519
bit too much physical damage and has

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
been unrooted from the ground now at

53
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,959
this rate we're not going to get any

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
yield from this plant since it obviously

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,719
isn't growing but we've put so much

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,598
effort into it already so what else can

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,560
we do

58
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,238
we could take clones many clones now

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,719
many people would see this plant and

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,640
think okay i killed my cannabis plant

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,639
and it's over but i'm going to show you

62
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,519
just how many clones you could take from

63
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,439
a dead cannabis plant

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,760
so you're going to want to cut from the

65
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,439
nodes always and try to get ones that

66
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,439
have long stalks so here's one

67
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,919
and 20. by now i think you get the point

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,759
and realize that even though this may be

69
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,439
a dead cannabis plant there are many

70
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,919
possibilities that you could choose to

71
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:05,069
revive it and move on from this damage

72
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,069
