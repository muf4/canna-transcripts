1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
here we're going to put special

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,278
classification of hormones called sex

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,080
hormones

4
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:08,400
now these sex hormones are steroid

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,460
hormones and they're produced by the

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,679
ovaries testes or adrenal cortex may

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,570
affect both growth and function of

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,278
reproductive organs as well as a

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,649
development of secondary sex

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,179
characteristics 3 we're going to focus

11
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,729
on in this lecture series are

12
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,759
testosterone estrogen and progesterone

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,060
we see this on average horn production

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,789
over age for sexual and production in

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,039
both men and women we can see here it's

16
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,439
clearly not consistent over someone's

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,539
life span will be different ages that

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,509
there's certain peaks and drop-offs that

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:45,299
occur estrogen is typically considered

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:48,539
the female hormone and testosterone the

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:52,169
male hormone even though they occur in

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,719
both genders starting with testosterone

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,179
it is produced in the ovaries and women

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,030
in the testes in men and the adrenal

25
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,439
glands in both genders it stimulates the

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,899
development of what's typically

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,158
associated as male characteristics it

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,260
plays an important role during male

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,109
puberty sparking growth spurts hair

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,950
growth and genital changes as a male

31
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:16,799
ages the testosterone will decrease at

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,009
age 25 we'll hear we about 100 percent

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,280
and we saw this slowly degredation as

34
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,950
the male ages at age 60 that same male

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,590
only have about 45 to 50 percent of the

36
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,840
testosterone they had when they were 25

37
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,850
some of the influences of testosterone

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,009
could see different areas influenced

39
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,798
here's at the skin the brain the bone

40
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,780
marrow and muscles muscles in particular

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,290
it was involved with increasing muscle

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,659
mass and also strength testosterone may

43
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,610
be used in on certain steroids or

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,040
performance-enhancing drugs because a

45
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,500
lot of people want to increase muscle

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,430
mass and strength in testosterone one

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,019
hormone that can influence that moving

48
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,780
on to estrogen which is typically

49
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,359
considered a female hormone it affects

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,149
both men in women though it helps

51
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,068
control the menstrual cycle and protects

52
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,909
bone health and keeps cholesterol in

53
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:13,829
control it's also critical to fertility

54
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:16,199
it's produced primarily in the ovaries

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,120
which is produces a woman's eggs however

56
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,030
it's also produced in the adrenal glands

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,120
which also makes some of this estrogen

58
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,939
which is why both men and women will

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,400
have estrogen at least in small amounts

60
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,520
for men because both have adrenal glands

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,860
located near the kidneys the last

62
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,500
hormone here project progesterone is

63
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,550
involved in fertility in the

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,530
administration and are largely

65
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,439
controlled by hormones one of them being

66
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,120
progesterone but it prepares the

67
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,210
endometrium for potential pregnancy

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,590
after ovulation you can see here our

69
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,010
graph of how it's changing during the

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,200
menstrual cycle here it can also trigger

71
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:58,229
the thickening the lining to thicken and

72
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,759
accept a fertilized egg in females so

73
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,929
those are just a quick overview of the

74
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,929
three sex hormones
