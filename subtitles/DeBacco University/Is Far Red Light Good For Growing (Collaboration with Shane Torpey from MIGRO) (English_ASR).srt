1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,200
this debacco University video we've got

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,080
yet another collaboration here with

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,719
Shane from migro this time discussing

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,000
far red light is it good for growing

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,239
he'll be giving you some background

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,919
information on exactly what is far red

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,519
and answering some of the common grower

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,519
questions such as does it cause my plant

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,359
to flower or how does it affect the

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:26,278
plant's morphology so stay tuned and

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,279
hope you enjoy this collaboration

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
video

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,238
well welcome everyone I've got Shane

14
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,959
here from migro breaking apart all the

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:40,919
lighting questions that you may have and

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,719
getting into some more of the details

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,399
and this video here we're going to dive

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,239
into the effect of far red light on

19
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,558
plant growth try to give you some

20
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,198
background on this you know Define what

21
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,198
it is how's it different than red light

22
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,960
and do we actually need it so first

23
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,920
question obviously we've heard about red

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,359
light blue light green light um previous

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,239
videos tied it into par tied it into

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
Lighting in General now we're kind of

27
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:07,118
diving into far red light so the obvious

28
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:10,359
question is Shane what is far red light

29
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:14,200
so we have the strict par uh range which

30
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:17,079
is from Blue to Red so from 400 to 700

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,759
nanometers and that's what we measure as

32
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:24,118
as causing photosynthesis in Plants just

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,000
beyond red just beyond 700 nanometers

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,159
from

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,960
7750 nanm is where the far red um spe

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,640
radiation is this is just about visible

37
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,478
you would see it if there's a far red

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,359
LED for example you would see a a dull

39
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,959
sort of red glow from it um it's not

40
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:47,159
quite up into infrared which is

41
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,559
effectively radiated heat um and it does

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,240
cause photosynthesis it's not as

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,079
efficient in photosynthetic terms as for

44
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,280
example red um but it does cause

45
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,959
photosynthesis and it can also have an

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,159
effect on plant shape

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,000
they mentioned a little bit there about

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,560
you know how's it you know it's close to

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,599
red light not quite infrared light it's

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,679
in that kind of in between Zone if

51
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,400
you're looking at wavelength so how do

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,560
it differ than um than red light in

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,239
general there and you talked about a

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,120
little bit of how it changes the

55
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,400
morphology why should we be concerned

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,200
about this so in in in nature um far red

57
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,159
is is effectively uh reflected light um

58
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,318
and so if you are down in the canopy um

59
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,359
in shade below say for example trees on

60
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,598
a forest flooor um or simply in shade

61
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,800
behind a wall in a garden um the amount

62
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,560
of of far red that the plant will be

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,439
receiving will be increased in

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,920
proportion to if it's out of shade um

65
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,158
and in direct sunlight and the reason

66
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,399
this is significant is the plants have H

67
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:56,039
receptors for um they're call

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,560
phytochrome receptors but they have

69
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:02,359
receptors for detecting red and far red

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,598
and and if they detect higher proportion

71
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,159
of far red to Red than is in in direct

72
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,598
sunlight um it is telling the plant that

73
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,000
it is in shade and will trigger a

74
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,798
response from that plant and the

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,039
response from that plant is to basically

76
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,439
stretch to grow to somewhere or to move

77
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:23,798
to somewhere um where it can get an

78
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:26,919
increase in life um in short if you have

79
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,080
a higher proportion of far red to Red in

80
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,199
your grow light spectrum you can cause

81
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,480
plants to

82
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,318
stretch this can be modified or

83
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:38,119
moderated by high proportions of blue

84
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:42,119
which as we said in other videos is um

85
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,840
will will will um reduce plant uh height

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,319
and CA shorten dense growth in summary

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,158
you know with regards to far red there's

88
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:52,158
a lot of sort of um excitement about it

89
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,158
over the last year or two because it's

90
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,560
available in LED D terms they're quite

91
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,078
efficient um they're reasonably uh

92
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,158
commercially viable they're reasonably

93
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:06,079
cheap to provide provide but in my view

94
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:08,959
they are less efficient than the red for

95
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,239
example from a photosynthesis uh point

96
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,719
of view and also may lead to plan

97
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,879
stretching so I don't recommend the um

98
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,798
and don't I don't recommend that you

99
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:21,199
need um a high percentage of far red or

100
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,519
additional far red in your grow light

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,919
spectrum thank you sh you're right we

102
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,319
got a lot of talk a lot of uh questions

103
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,000
about it people seeking specifically out

104
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,159
you know far red because you think oh

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
it's more more light you know different

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
wavelengths going to give you you know

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
maybe different profiles different you

108
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,399
know reactions for the plant but just as

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
you had kind of mentioned there might

110
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,758
want to stick a little bit more with the

111
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,439
red light uh than the far red light

112
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,600
because of that shade Factor perception

113
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,199
of shade Factor by those plants and

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,360
indoor growing operations again using

115
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,759
the artificial lights stretching tends

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,680
not to be Growers friend if this is

117
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,400
going to help induce more stretching

118
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,918
that could cause um some potential

119
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,279
issues there but as mentioned before

120
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,839
look at some of the other videos blue

121
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,918
light can have a counteracting effect um

122
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,000
so again thank you for your Insight on

123
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,279
this to allow uh Growers to make

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,038
educated decisions on what they choose

125
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:14,399
to go with in their operation there's

126
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,240
one other uh small uh two other small

127
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:20,399
comments I'd make about fared first is

128
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,800
people um have heard that maybe it can

129
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:28,000
cause plants to flower and that that it

130
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,560
can be true in long day plants um that

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,959
um you know in some cases use far red to

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,120
stimulate flowering cannabis is a short

133
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,959
day plant so it's not U it's not

134
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,280
relevant to um to cannabis Growers and

135
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,198
the other one is that um far red can

136
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:45,519
cause Leaf expansion so it can cause

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,360
more leaves and larger leaves and to

138
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:52,680
grow um relative to to to lower having

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,879
using lower levels of far red and that

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,519
may be useful in terms of you know you

141
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,120
might get a a slight H you could use it

142
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,159
for example in the early stages of

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,240
growth get that canopy built up slightly

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,960
bigger but I've never seen any evidence

145
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,918
um to uh to demonstrate that and I would

146
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,079
suspect that the benefits are are are

147
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,918
small or

148
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,758
marginal thanks for providing that you

149
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,918
know real world real world connection

150
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,520
there as far as you know what it might

151
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,680
do and then kind of what might be

152
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,639
observed and kind of you are going to

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,959
use it where it might be best to utilize

154
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,598
it in the growth stage or cycle um of

155
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,638
the plant and that's again love having

156
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,478
this collaboration here to provide

157
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,639
Growers with those uh true insights so

158
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,038
that they can hopefully choose to use it

159
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,840
or know what they're getting themselves

160
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,800
into what benefits they could

161
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,560
potentially have but what issues they

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,560
also might run

163
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,279
into
