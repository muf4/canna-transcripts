1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,839
growers often wonder how plant hormones

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
can

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,119
affect cannabis plants well here we're

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,638
going to look at a scientific study

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,839
that's the impact of the plant growth

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:16,439
regular naa

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:19,359
on cannabis

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,000
[Music]

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,480
all right let's get into the study here

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,719
so first off the two hormones naa and

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,240
bap are the ones that were studied anase

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,678
is synthetic meaning it does not occur

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,518
naturally plant hormone

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,039
in the auxin family so we're going to

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,600
see kind of how auxins

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,280
impact cannabis plant growth this auxin

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,359
family can also be toxic at high

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,600
concentrations to plants

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,799
concentration and dose is very important

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,079
the common ingredient with many plant

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,718
plant-rooting natural

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,439
horticultural products there so a lot of

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,879
them say oh

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,960
naturally occurring you know auxins well

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,599
this one is a synthetically produced

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
but it is in the auxin family which is a

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
naturally occurring

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,719
plant hormone now bap is the first

29
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,519
generation synthetic cytokinin another

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,120
plant hormone

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,359
that causes plant growth in development

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
responses such as setting blossoms and

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,840
stimulating cell division

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,559
is an inhibitory of respiratory kinase

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,359
implants

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
and increases post-harvest life in green

37
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,840
vegetables

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,158
we can see the examples of those

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,799
hormones here both of these were done

40
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,320
in an exact study on cannabis if you're

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
wondering what that study was and some

42
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,079
of maybe more of the specifics

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,599
here's the proper citation here's kind

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,118
of that first page there for you're

45
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,719
welcome to go research it

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,759
take a look at it and look at it in more

47
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,719
detail however what they basically found

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,840
i'm going to provide kind of that

49
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,400
general summary

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
here we're looking at mean plant height

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,600
so we're looking at our two graphs here

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,759
the control is the solid line in both

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,719
and then the lighter or dashed line is

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,879
the different

55
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,438
hormones if you mind a is the auxin

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,959
family bep is in the cytokinin family

57
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,199
so in these graphs we're looking at the

58
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,478
mean plant height over all three tested

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,118
genotypes

60
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,478
the nas number elephants in graph a up

61
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,879
here and baps

62
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,159
in the graph b down here the means

63
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,718
covered with at least

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,079
one identical lowercase letter did not

65
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,039
have a significant difference at a

66
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,079
p-value

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,920
of 0.05 the arrows show the period

68
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,200
60-90 days during which applications

69
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,359
took place so we could see the

70
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,878
application made here around day 6

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
and then another application made here

72
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,159
around day 90.

73
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,679
and we're seeing the changes that occur

74
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,919
over time overall a days after planting

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
the plant height is going to be taller

76
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,479
in the control which is basically the

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,360
non-treated plant

78
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,959
compared to the one that had the auxin

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
family hormone applied

80
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,199
and here the control also ended up mean

81
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,598
plant height was taller

82
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,518
compared to the one what had the

83
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,878
cytokinins applied to it

84
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
again these are all significantly

85
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
different and we can see that throughout

86
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,799
the growth cycle here

87
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,238
now the number of internodes so as we're

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
looking at kind of counting the

89
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
internodes

90
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,159
the mean number of internodes per

91
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,039
axillary branch over two tested

92
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,318
genotypes

93
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,318
and you can look at the study for more

94
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,238
information on that means covered with

95
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,679
at least one identical lowercase letter

96
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,800
did not offer significance

97
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,400
again that p value of 0.05

98
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
the arrows showed the time at point six

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,039
days after planting in

100
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
the first application and treated with

101
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,840
the

102
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,359
auxin and the cytokinin respectively

103
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
here we're looking at the number of

104
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
internets we kind of see a similar

105
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,439
pattern the control having more

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,680
internodes

107
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,359
than the oxen family hormone or the

108
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,200
cytokinin family hormone

109
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,799
that's basically true shortly after

110
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,759
pollination i'm sorry certainly after

111
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,599
application

112
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,479
they were both applied and then we see

113
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,000
that separation after that point

114
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,679
then the mean number of axillary

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,519
branches we're looking at the branching

116
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
point now the cannabis

117
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
in centimeters over the three tested

118
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,759
genotypes with our same two hormones

119
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
being studied

120
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,479
again same statistics applied p greater

121
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,479
than .05 is the different letters

122
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,560
the error shows the same point six days

123
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,959
after planting for the first application

124
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,719
and again here we see a large difference

125
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,438
of the control compared to the

126
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,080
auxin family our length of axillary

127
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:01,919
branches

128
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
much longer in the control compared to

129
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,479
those with that were applied with dioxin

130
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
we see a similar difference in most

131
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,840
cases with the

132
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,759
cytokinin applied but a generally a

133
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
similar trend even though it is

134
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,959
reduced in length of axillary branches

135
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,879
with the cytokinin applied one

136
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
now pgrs are important for cannabis

137
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,759
sativa so

138
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
the results of this study showed that

139
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,199
this extra

140
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,520
these exteriorly applied plant growth

141
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,319
regulators abbreviate pgrs

142
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,758
mainly nan bap had seen the impacts on

143
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,000
the plant architecture

144
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
of this cannabis sativa both of these

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
pgrs led to more complex

146
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
compact plant morphology so that might

147
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
be advantageous because the plants

148
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,399
didn't grow more

149
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,719
doesn't mean that's necessarily what

150
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,039
growers were looking for the use of na

151
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,199
led to more compact plant architecture

152
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
with a consistently high inflorescence

153
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,759
yield for the for

154
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
the particular genotype that they

155
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
studied a cbd or cannabidiol

156
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,319
content was not affected in these so

157
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
again good to see what was affected more

158
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,159
morphologically

159
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,439
but not affected on the cannabinoid

160
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
produced

161
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,918
now keep in mind a word of caution here

162
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,319
that there's no approved pgrs so in the

163
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,079
cultivation of medicinal grade cannabis

164
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,000
production there are currently no

165
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,879
approved pgrs to modify plant

166
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
architecture

167
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,719
this study was really just showing that

168
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,079
these are pgrs in production under good

169
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,800
manufacturing practice

170
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,399
typically abbreviated gmp or good

171
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,600
agriculture and collection practice

172
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,439
gacp guidelines are not clearly defined

173
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,199
so any products applied to the plants

174
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,439
should be documented

175
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
uh for sure there again there's

176
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,240
different rules always

177
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,919
laws and changing but definitely

178
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
document it as of right now there's no

179
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,038
approved pgrs for cannabis applications

180
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,918
so if we're looking at kind of our kind

181
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,279
of important for that plant morphology

182
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,120
it is important to note that the use of

183
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,519
pgrs did not reduce the biomass

184
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,280
yield in the content of cannabinoids the

185
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,198
goal is to produce small compact plants

186
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,959
intended for indoor growing environments

187
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
the example here i have potentially for

188
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,959
like a grow tent or something that might

189
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
be ceiling

190
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,079
in generally size limited the naa

191
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
produced a short habit plant reduced the

192
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,839
number of internodes in

193
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
sitting in the shortest axillary side

194
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,560
branches so that's the effects of

195
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,840
applying that

196
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,240
auxin family hormone the cytokinin-based

197
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,119
family of hormones bap create that short

198
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
shorter habit

199
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,120
reduce the number of internodes and

200
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,399
shorter axillary side branches so just

201
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,519
important to note that both of these

202
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,359
create that more

203
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,918
compact plant which might be

204
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,240
advantageous for some growers

205
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,439
now the degradation so synthetic ias

206
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,319
which are endol

207
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,680
acetic acid are more stable than the

208
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,840
ones applied

209
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
and generously which are the ones

210
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,719
produced in the plant

211
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,079
and are degraded at a slower rate so

212
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,880
we're looking at considering plant

213
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,639
hormones

214
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,159
we want to consider the fact that they

215
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
are going to be broken down

216
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
now is it going to be a really rapid

217
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
kind of quick exponential

218
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
decay here is it going to be a slower

219
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
more linear form

220
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,038
that could be dependent on the exact

221
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,879
hormone depending on the condition

222
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,879
depending on a lot of environmental

223
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,279
factors as well so again

224
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,719
important to take into consideration you

225
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,559
want to know the application

226
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
and the concentration so with all

227
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,519
hormones when using synthetic pgrs it's

228
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
very important

229
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,240
to know the exact exactly the

230
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
appropriate application method

231
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,000
and also the concentrations to avoid

232
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,478
potential negative impact on the final

233
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,598
product

234
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,519
as you mentioned one of these is an

235
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,519
auxin family hormone well

236
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,639
certain oxygen family hormones applied

237
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,038
at the right levels

238
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
high levels can actually be herbicides

239
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,959
or basically kill

240
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,759
plants like 2 4-d falls into that

241
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,120
category

242
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,038
it's important though with ias it's a

243
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,399
high concentration or toxic and utilized

244
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,360
as an herbicide and that would be that 2

245
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,758
4-d

246
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
so again a little can be good but a lot

247
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,639
could potentially kill the plant so

248
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,439
just good practices for growers to know

249
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,360
the application

250
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,560
know the right concentration look at

251
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240
scientific studies like the one

252
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,519
presented here in detail

253
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
to make sure you're getting all those

254
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,719
correct so you're getting the potential

255
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,639
benefits that you're seeking

256
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,520
without any of the potential negative

257
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,519
side effects
