1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,439
welcome to debacle university where here

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,759
we're going to be looking

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,359
at a video lecture to determine the

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,638
refractive index of

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,839
glass now refractive index abbreviated

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,439
ri

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,199
is looking at when light travels from

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,640
one medium to another its speed changes

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,118
relative to the density of the medium

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,439
which is

11
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,039
observed as the light bends traveling

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,480
from one medium to the other

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,480
the speed of light keep in mind in a

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,640
vacuum is represented by the letter c

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,719
and is always the same but when light

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
moves from one medium and travels

17
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,640
more slowly as it goes to another medium

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,280
as it's constantly being absorbed and

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,840
re-emitted

20
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,439
by the atoms in that material now the

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,640
ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum

22
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,280
to the speed of light in another

23
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,239
substance

24
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
is defined as the index of refraction or

25
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,839
refractive

26
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,960
index and it's represented in equations

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
as the letter

28
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
n for that substance so if you look here

29
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
here's

30
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
n this is going to be referring to the

31
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,039
refractive index now what does this

32
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,039
actually look like

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
well up here we notice that when light

34
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,120
travels from one medium to another it's

35
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,198
bending because we have a change in the

36
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
speed of that light what's kind of a

37
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,399
neat experiment here is we have a glass

38
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,559
with a piece of paper behind it with the

39
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,159
arrow pointing in one direction we fill

40
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
that glass full of water and the air

41
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
will actually flip the direction there

42
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,519
because of a difference in refractive

43
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,478
index

44
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,840
now the refractive index and probability

45
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,478
well there's a database

46
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,400
of refractive indexes for different

47
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,200
types of glass and this helps determine

48
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,359
an appropriate

49
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
statistical probability that two pieces

50
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,920
of glass share a common source

51
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,078
may not offer that exact match but it

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
can increase the probability that yes

53
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,039
it's very

54
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
likely or unlikely a high probability or

55
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,520
a low probability

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
that those two pieces of glass will

57
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,478
match one another

58
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,399
now how do we determining that

59
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,000
refractive index well we can use the

60
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,920
submersion method this is just kind of a

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,280
quick quote down and dirty method of

62
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,879
determining this

63
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
you'd place the glass or fragments of

64
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,759
that glass into different liquids of

65
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,158
known refractive

66
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,200
indexes if the piece of glass in a

67
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,118
liquid have the same

68
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
refractive index the glass fragment will

69
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,078
seem to disappear when placed in that

70
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
liquid

71
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,679
and here is a prime example we have a

72
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
beaker the liquid has the same

73
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,399
refractive index as this column in this

74
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
test tube and we could see everything

75
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
appears to disappear

76
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,680
simply because of the same refractive

77
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,919
index therefore they're kind of

78
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,680
disappearing because we don't have that

79
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,119
difference between those two substances

80
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,319
occurring

81
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,120
now we can also use a microscope

82
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,079
submersion along with a low power

83
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
microscope

84
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
now submerge fragments of glass in a

85
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
liquid and then view them under a low

86
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,878
power microscope using

87
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,159
particularly a compound light microscope

88
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,239
this is great for small

89
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,759
pieces or small fragments that are found

90
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,519
and in this case if the refractive index

91
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,280
of the liquid and medium is different

92
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,120
from the refractive index of the piece

93
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,878
of glass a halo-like

94
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
ring appears around the edge of that

95
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,560
glass and you can see that here

96
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
the halo-like effect is called the beck

97
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,039
line looking a little bit more detailed

98
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
at this

99
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,719
bec line you can kind of see an example

100
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
of that here

101
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,239
it appears because refracted light

102
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,439
becomes concentrated around the edges of

103
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,640
the glass fragment

104
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,158
and a backline is visible under a

105
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,759
microscope and the glass and liquid have

106
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,280
different refractive indices

107
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,878
so in this case in the middle image here

108
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,158
where they're both the same backline's

109
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,518
in the middle and they kind of all blur

110
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,799
together and they kind of merge and we

111
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
don't really see that backline

112
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
developing

113
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,560
however in this case here we have the

114
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,760
perimeter of the piece of glass

115
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,878
and we have the liquid being a lower

116
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,000
refractive index

117
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,518
than the actual glass piece this halo

118
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
like effect if you look at the perimeter

119
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,519
of the glass is located on the inside

120
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,080
of that piece of glass in contrast

121
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,439
if the liquid has a greater refractive

122
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
index

123
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,519
than the piece of glass we have that

124
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,919
same halo-like effect but in this case

125
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
the hill-like effect is on the outside

126
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,518
of the edges of the glass so it's

127
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
important not only to identify the

128
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
presence of a back line

129
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,519
because that will tell you that there is

130
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,399
a difference in refractive indices

131
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
between the

132
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
glass piece and the liquid medium but

133
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,840
where that halo

134
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,920
is found will tell you which one is

135
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
greater that can help you determine the

136
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,679
approximate

137
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,759
range of the refractive index for that

138
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,319
piece of glass that you're investigating

139
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,840
so here's some additional pictures

140
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,318
showing the refractive index of the

141
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
medium

142
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,560
versus the glass the liquid versus the

143
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,439
glass and that bending that's occurring

144
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,358
so here we see kind of that rays are

145
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,959
kind of converging here

146
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,039
this is because the glass has a higher

147
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
refractive index and the back line is

148
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,919
seen on the

149
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
inside you can see that right here on

150
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,719
that inside of that fragmented

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
glass now in this case is the opposite

152
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,960
where the glass has a lower refractive

153
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,399
index

154
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,879
the back line here is seen on the

155
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,839
outside of that perimeter there because

156
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,079
the rays are

157
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,599
diverging so it makes it a little bit

158
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,399
clearer kind of that true little halo

159
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,479
effect

160
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,560
here we're seeing the evidence of that

161
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,719
clear outside where that outside is and

162
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
where's the halo occurring in relation

163
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
to that

164
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
if it's occurring on the inside as we

165
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,239
see here that means the glass is a high

166
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,759
refractive index

167
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
and here if that halo is occurring on

168
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,879
the outside of that

169
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,600
glass this is a sign that the glass is a

170
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,038
lower refractive index

171
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,879
now here's just some examples of

172
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,599
refractive index of known liquids so if

173
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,839
you had

174
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
something or a piece of glass that you

175
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,959
thought what the refractive index was or

176
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,720
for comparison

177
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,079
these are some common liquids that can

178
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360
be used

179
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,439
for that becca line determination

180
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,038
now lastly here we can look at tempered

181
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,560
versus non-tempered glass and when

182
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,360
trying to make a distinction between

183
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,600
tempered glass and non-tempered glass

184
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,280
particles process known as annealing is

185
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
used an annealing is the slow heating

186
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,638
and then cooling of that glass that

187
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
alters the microstructure

188
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,400
of the material causing changes in

189
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
properties such as strength and hardness

190
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,478
annealing alters refractive index value

191
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,600
for tempered glass greater than that of

192
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,439
non-tempered glass

193
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,639
so this can also act as a way for

194
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,038
determining that

195
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
when we're looking at knowing what the

196
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,639
refractive index is

197
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,638
for a piece of glass
