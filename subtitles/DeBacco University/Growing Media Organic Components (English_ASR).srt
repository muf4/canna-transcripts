1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
now in growing media there are organic

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,628
components that are added I'm going to

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,250
go through some of the common ones that

4
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:11,339
are added that are added to growing

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,250
media such as peat moss bark coconut

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:17,250
quar and worm castings are some common

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,990
organic additives to growing media well

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,698
starting with peat moss it doesn't

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,919
degrade easily making it a stable

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,800
compound to incorporate into bags

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,660
I can also acidify surrounding so that

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,039
can be a concern and a lot of times in

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,018
growing media bags you'll see if peat

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,719
moss is added you'll also see some form

15
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,269
of lime also added lotta peat moss comes

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,129
off from Canada as we see here now the

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,870
advantages is that it's free of weed

18
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,759
seeds pests and pathogens that could

19
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,159
absorb up to 20 times its weight in

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,399
water this is often the time why it's

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,919
added to growing media it's naturally

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,590
hydrophobic as a downfall so this can

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,210
need time to hydrate this is important

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,710
to remember if you're looking at when

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,570
you initially are working with gray

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,799
media if it initially kind of water kind

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,869
of sheets off and doesn't really

28
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,608
incorporate well you have to slowly add

29
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:06,209
some more moisture to get this just

30
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,129
slowly wet over time also peat moss it

31
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:09,658
comes from peat bogs and there is some

32
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,329
concerns because most of it comes out of

33
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,700
Canada that with increased usage this

34
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,289
could be depleting some natural peat

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,650
bogs they take a very long time to

36
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,409
replenish another organic component is

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,560
bark chips which is commonly pine bark

38
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:27,780
uncombined pie mark and pine bark mulch

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,909
example here in bags alone like it's

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,519
used typically on the top to dress up

41
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,290
gardens or flowerbeds can also be

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,780
incorporating to growing media the

43
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,130
reason why is it proves drainage and

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,228
keeps the weight of the final product

45
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:41,670
down to a minimum and as I said it's

46
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,259
often used to the top dress for flower

47
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,670
gardens but a lot of times it is

48
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,579
incorporated into some growing medians

49
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,310
to help increase that porosity they have

50
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,919
coconut quar that's made from the middle

51
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,478
portion of the coconut and it needs to

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,609
be treated before it can be used for

53
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,289
growing media to leach the salts it's

54
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,450
naturally high in salts if you are

55
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,630
buying it for growing media sometimes it

56
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,520
will come pre washed which is great the

57
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,890
advantages of cocoa quoi the reason why

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,709
it is use so often that is a renewable

59
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,139
resource it's free of wheat seeds pests

60
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,950
and pathogens it's only slightly acidic

61
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,619
with a page

62
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,719
six 26.7 typically now with the

63
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,719
downfalls to Coco cars and it is hi

64
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,759
insults it can require a long shipping

65
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,699
distance to the United States so just

66
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,598
because we see them being available but

67
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,729
to think about where that original

68
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,409
product came from and that's typically

69
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,329
many many miles away

70
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,250
it does require hydration before you

71
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,500
used to get it to adequately absorb

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,180
moisture and quality can vary from batch

73
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,009
to batch depending on the original

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,140
source material so just because you're

75
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,429
purchasing Coco Co are often the same

76
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,139
company doesn't mean they're getting it

77
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,930
from the same source so there can be a

78
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:52,500
great deal of variability from one batch

79
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,840
to another some limitations of Coco car

80
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,060
there's a need for extra additions of

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,489
calcium and magnesium products that will

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,769
not be needed in the same allowance for

83
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,509
other base materials so people grow in

84
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,280
Coco car typically will get a cal mag

85
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,620
type product that they need to

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,879
supplement with to negate some of the

87
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,390
potential negatives that can be

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,030
associate with Coco car alasa here we

89
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:16,768
have worm castings these contain highly

90
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,169
biologically active products that are

91
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,390
high in human content they contain

92
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,858
nutrients to support plant growth but

93
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:24,839
the total values are minimal so while

94
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:26,820
does have nutrients overall it's kind of

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,469
a minimal percentage about the

96
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,599
advantages this is in near neutral pH

97
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,939
and there's a wide variety of uses with

98
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,680
minimal chance of burning the plants it

99
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,139
almost plant directly write in worm

100
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,180
castings and not burn the plant which is

101
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,488
not true with some other even organic

102
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,379
materials however worm castings can be

103
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,030
costly if you are growing in an outdoor

104
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,519
environment so the exact in a lawn

105
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,680
setting if there's natural earthworms

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,680
the plants can get this beneficial

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,299
product for free so in the outdoor

108
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,549
situations typically worm castings

109
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,430
aren't need to be added but in container

110
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,079
growing and Salus media it can be

111
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,000
advantageous to kind of bring in some of

112
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,459
the benefits that outdoor plants may

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,459
enjoy to a container or indoor setting
