1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,379
okay here we're look at the coordination

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,048
of secretion and absorption in relation

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,000
to the human body digestive system mass

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,789
secretion make a look at the sundew here

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,730
this secretes this clear very sticky

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,198
substance that helps trap insects in

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,859
absorption we can think of the sponge

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,109
absorbing water now looking first at

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,820
secretion we have separatin and this is

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,368
released when time arrives in the

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,550
duodenum and increases the secretion of

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,689
bile a buffers by the liver pancreas so

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,119
what does this mean so here's our

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,350
duodenum remember we just have left

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,669
these stomach and this secretin is

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,189
starting and cascading of events here

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,679
it's time remember that's coming out of

18
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,859
the stomach and this is going to bring

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,719
in or stimulate bile to be produced by

20
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,409
the liver and enter into the small

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,989
intestine also at the same time CCK or

22
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,849
cholecystokinin will be released this is

23
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,988
secreted also in the duodenum which is

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,809
the early part of the small intestine

25
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,299
when chyme contains lipids and partially

26
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,789
digested proteins so help accelerate

27
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,158
pancreatic production and secretion of

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,420
digestive enzymes the body doesn't want

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,510
to waste time producing enzymes it

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,450
doesn't need cholecystokinin here CCK

31
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,100
will signal pancreas to release the

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,630
enzymes to help break down these food

33
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,879
items they're determined to be there

34
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,149
rejecting violent introduced into

35
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,250
duodenum will also be another role of

36
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,109
this so we can look here again as our

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,090
food is our stomach is our intestine

38
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,879
pancreas livers are all kind of coming

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,439
together here and the intestine releases

40
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,390
secretary and closes the Kleins

41
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,548
stimulating the secretion of pink red

42
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,379
juice and bile secretion means to kind

43
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,600
of release and that's going to be in the

44
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,969
early part of the small intestine to

45
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,609
allow the absorption to marry next topic

46
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,340
to talk about to occur over the vast

47
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,859
majority of the rest of the digestive

48
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,680
tract so looking just at that absorption

49
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,420
in general it takes about five hours for

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,490
materials to pass from the duodenum to

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,399
the end of the iliyan movements of the

52
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,599
mucosa increased absorb detected s so

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,030
what's occurring within the body

54
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,468
well we're absorbing a lot of things now

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,270
we can see here if the main part

56
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:11,519
absorbing the nutrients and water to

57
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,290
blood vessels and lymph at the cells and

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,980
this occurs mainly in this small

59
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,539
intestine

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,039
keep in mind also during this process

61
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,739
were having stirring and mixing of the

62
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,539
contents water to blood vessels is

63
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,700
occurring mainly in the large intestine

64
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:27,120
so the body is absorbing not only

65
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,729
nutrients but also water we want to do

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
this to maintain hydration keep in mind

67
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:34,109
most of our absorption is occurring in

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,209
the small intestine here it's

69
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,060
approximately 19 and a half feet and for

70
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,699
the large intestine is shorter and that

71
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,628
is being mainly used here for water

72
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,628
reabsorption
