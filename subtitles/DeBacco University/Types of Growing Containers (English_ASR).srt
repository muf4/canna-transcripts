1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,539
now here we're going to be looking at

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,940
different types of growing containers

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,879
and we can see in this image the wide

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,019
variety of containers being grown here

5
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:12,870
we'll get some things that are a little

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,089
bit more commonly used so first off the

7
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:17,730
common types of containers are plastic

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,890
or solid side pots AER pots fabric pots

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,109
grow bags biodegradable pots by a couple

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,140
different names here and also discuss

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,720
where square pots vs. round pots may be

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,310
most advantageous to use so starting off

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,320
with the obvious we have our plastic

14
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,629
solid side pots and see a wide variety

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,210
here they're very common to consider to

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,829
be the standard there's many options in

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,750
size and shape and color and thickness

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,140
they often have the option of being

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,670
reused this is what makes them the kind

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,259
of standard they're kind of lightweight

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,989
they're easy to get they can get in

22
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,488
large quantities oh and the options are

23
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,839
being reused is the main reason why

24
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,640
these are considered the standards

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,059
however there's other options available

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,820
to growers such as air pots the goal is

27
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,500
to maximize aeration they induce air

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,149
pruning of roots to reduce roots

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,299
circling basically they allow air to

30
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,239
come in and because the root tips then

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,250
to kind of dry out and cause those roots

32
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,109
tips to dry out but then causing

33
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,790
increased branching now they've been

34
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,950
used a lot in tree production as we can

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,130
see here to make for easier transplant

36
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,469
process again well there's a zoom in one

37
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,030
of here they can be used also on a large

38
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,310
scale they've gone through some

39
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,379
different revisions but again in tree

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,150
production is kind of where they're most

41
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,188
commonly being used now these are

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,340
looking at being transplanted outgrown

43
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:37,228
propagated and then transplanted fabric

44
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,270
pots are smart pots is a name-brand

45
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:40,978
familiar with that they clean the same

46
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:44,009
benefits as air pots but they have the

47
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:45,599
added benefit of easy delivery storage

48
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,819
and shipping this is because they

49
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,158
completely fold down and they keep most

50
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,709
vacuum sealed many pots to be shipped in

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,659
a very small area they're available in

52
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,239
very small sizes too as you can see here

53
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,040
very large sizes so don't think that

54
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,199
these fabric pots are just limited to

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,000
small little grow bags they can be grown

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,430
full-sized plants in an outdoor

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,799
situation that we see here these pallets

58
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,599
are approximately 4 feet by 4 feet just

59
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,510
to give you an idea there's a

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,629
traditional plastic pot in comparison

61
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:14,009
grow

62
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,719
Baggs something a little different

63
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,759
there's potential confusion between

64
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,740
fabric pots and bags depending on the

65
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,289
material grow bags are typically made

66
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,790
from plastic creating a solid sides so

67
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,319
unlike the fabric pots we saw there is a

68
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,539
lot of breathing that may occur these

69
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,219
are typically solid sides how are these

70
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,989
plat this plastic is considered as

71
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,449
closer resemblance of a heavy trash bag

72
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,879
than a rigid side of a traditional

73
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:38,039
plastic pot they offer again the ease of

74
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,319
storage reduced shipping cost and light

75
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,509
weight and benefits associated similar

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,449
to the fabric pots the drawbacks include

77
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,549
that reduced usage life is typically one

78
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:49,739
to three years at one of these grow bags

79
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,500
that will not last forever and depending

80
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,180
what conditions they are used in then we

81
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,800
have biodegradable pots the goal is be

82
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,680
able to plant the entire pot to reduce

83
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,219
waste and time common types include the

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,980
peat pot or Jiffy Pop there's Cal pots

85
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,229
dot pots and croire pots these are some

86
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:10,289
common names 50 being by the most widely

87
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,090
known Cal pots being made out of

88
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,069
literally cow manure and I say

89
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,200
biodegradable while we have all the

90
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,719
different pot types the vat it really

91
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,789
does vary we can see here's a field

92
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,500
trial Iran with tomatoes you could see a

93
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,060
choir pot here rates that he did not

94
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,979
degrade at all even though roots were

95
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,319
able to penetrate the cow pot almost

96
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,969
completely broke down the jiffy pot did

97
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,459
break down but still has some of its

98
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:35,219
large components still visible in the

99
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,770
field after a growing season air for

100
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,659
tomato then we get to the bay of round

101
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,920
versus square and keep in mind that the

102
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,379
plants now prefer one over the other

103
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,849
however to maximize space to grow me one

104
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,009
a favor one versus the other

105
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,509
brilliant plant development square pots

106
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,429
are preferred since this allows

107
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,439
efficient packing plants and minimizes

108
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,599
empty space that we see here can align

109
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,400
all these pots up together reason why I

110
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,109
like the square pots early on is packing

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,390
all these together efficient use of

112
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,650
space and also kind of keeping that

113
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,229
moisture level a little bit higher

114
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,180
there's no reduces air flow in total

115
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,819
they're keeping all those that moisture

116
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,439
they're in close proximity and also

117
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,750
allows these to be tapped under lights

118
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,090
efficiently later in development though

119
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,949
is when transplanting and shape is less

120
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,350
of a concern simply because plants are

121
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,129
not growing in a pot to pot kind of

122
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,200
situation

123
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,879
round pots are preferred simply because

124
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,129
there'll be less media used for the same

125
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,360
basic footprint because those plants are

126
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:28,038
going

127
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,038
be bigger and spread out those pots are

128
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:33,168
going to be touching typically anyway

129
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:35,149
sober can switch over to the round so

130
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:37,250
even though the plants don't really care

131
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,019
which one versus the other the grower

132
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,269
may depending on the situation depending

133
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,269
on the growth stage of the plant
