1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
okay what we're looking at impressions

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,519
here if we're looking at

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,919
footwear there can be two and three

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,279
dimensions of these impressions taken

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,799
it could be kind of an inked image which

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,558
would be a two dimension or kind of a

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,679
poured cast to take advantage of the

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,759
three dimensions

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
so i'm going to cover that here so

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,439
looking at the footwear analysis

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
well areas of footwear which are

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,439
examined by analysis include the design

13
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,480
of the shoe the physical size and shape

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,399
the wear marks

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,240
and also individual identifying

16
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,278
characteristics such as

17
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,879
cuts and or tears or or the gum that

18
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,640
might be present or a nail

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
or anything else that would be kind of

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,359
very specific

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
to that one particular shoe now two and

22
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,320
three dimensional are impressions well

23
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,839
how do they differ we're looking at

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
our two dimensional impressions those

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,200
are impressions made they could be on

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
tile

27
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,440
wood flooring similar highly available

28
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,000
surfaces linoleum

29
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,280
it can be also latent prints three

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,439
dimensional impressions

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
are remaining after a shoe permanently

32
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,358
deforms the surface found in sand mud

33
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,799
or snow so that is an example of the two

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,439
to three dimensional impressions and

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
both

36
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,519
can be very important now the visible

37
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,478
prints as we see

38
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,679
here these prints are visible with no

39
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,280
additional processes

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
needed so the ones you can just kind of

41
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
look down and quote find

42
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,399
if you know where to look this could be

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,079
examples include soil or the materials

44
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
picked up by the shoe or deposit onto a

45
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,280
flat hard contrasting surface

46
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
there's a variety of surfaces and

47
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,879
materials deposited makes recovery

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,079
from those prints very complex so again

49
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,000
whether it's

50
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,599
something that's in a very hard surface

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
a very soft surface

52
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,319
a heavier individual a lighter

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,320
individual all this is going to impact

54
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,438
the visibility of those particular

55
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,879
prints

56
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,478
and we have something called latent

57
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,640
prints so these prints require some

58
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,280
process to make them visible or

59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
very difficult to visualize these latent

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,239
prince examples could be very

61
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
barely visible dust if it's kind of in a

62
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,438
kind of attic for example it hasn't been

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,359
disturbed a lot

64
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:06,000
impressions and polishes or wax or waxes

65
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,200
those might need some additional kind of

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,439
processes done

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
to be able to make them visible either

68
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,719
to be photographed or just be visible by

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
the investigator

70
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,959
those are latent prints so here we're

71
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,399
looking at two-dimensional impressions

72
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,159
so once an impression has been

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,719
photographed the print may be able to be

74
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,439
lifted

75
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,959
off the particular surface electrostatic

76
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,280
lifting can help transfer it

77
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,199
and fingerprint powder can be used in

78
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,479
combination with what's called pvs

79
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,479
which is polyvinyl

80
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
which is a casting material that can be

81
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,840
used for impressions where electrostatic

82
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
lifting

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,039
may not work so this is kind of this

84
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,878
kind of

85
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,959
example of how we can potentially lift

86
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,239
that print off the area to be examined

87
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,680
in the lab

88
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
we have also three dimensional

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
impressions so this

90
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,318
example here is where we can use dental

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
stone its primary method of

92
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,359
casting footwear impressions on wet

93
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
surfaces

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,360
spray wax maybe we have to be used to

95
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,318
first seal the impression off

96
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,080
then a mix of dental stone on site with

97
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,919
water in a sealable bag for about

98
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
three minutes and the stone hardens in

99
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,759
about 20 minutes

100
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,959
in about 24 to 40 hours but a day to two

101
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,359
days hours it will

102
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,000
be fully hardened and can be used and

103
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
stored

104
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
it's important to kind of create this

105
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,799
little setup but this is pretty easy to

106
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,200
do on site it doesn't really require

107
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
a lot of materials because it's all kind

108
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,199
of self-contained

109
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,679
now those 3d prints are shoe prints made

110
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,759
into soft material such as dirt or snow

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
the composition of the material will

112
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,199
determine the detail

113
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,439
of the impression made this often

114
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,359
requires making up a cast of the print

115
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,479
as we can see here and there's other

116
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
types as i said this

117
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,840
dental stone for example we can have a

118
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
little cardboard side here to help

119
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,759
sit in place this can be a great way to

120
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,799
help preserve those prints

121
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,039
to be able to be investigated looked at

122
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,760
and compared and entered as evidence at

123
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,759
a later date
