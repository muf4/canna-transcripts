1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,938
so here we talk about hydroponic

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,910
reservoirs which are basically

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,460
reservoirs or holding containers for

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,289
water see one here in a very large scale

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,490
to be we have these on much smaller

6
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,899
scale for smaller hydroponic operations

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,759
so in general should be as large as

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,679
possible for the given space you want to

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,689
have something overly oversized and

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,028
something undersized it needs to match

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,948
the area or space that you'll be growing

12
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:27,420
it should be located an area that does

13
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,760
not cause them to overheat keep

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,410
evaporation to a minimum I want to keep

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,809
the heat down as well

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,789
the level the EC and the temperature

17
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,128
need to be monitored when I say level I

18
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,450
mean the height within the reservoir you

19
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,488
want to let it get too low because if

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,960
you're running pumps especially that

21
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,359
could cause pumps to burn out or it

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,160
could cause not enough water to reach

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,019
your plants and cause them to have water

24
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,538
stress and could ultimately cause them

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,920
to die that target temperature being

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,739
sixty and seventy five degrees

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,559
Fahrenheit 18 to 24 degrees Celsius we

28
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,968
want to keep temps below eighty five

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,159
degrees Fahrenheit or third degrees

30
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,219
Celsius anything higher this should be

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,829
avoided do you see increased odds of

32
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,709
route damage because water holds oxygen

33
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,109
on a much poorer level at these warmer

34
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,879
temperatures if the heater is at it be

35
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,069
sure to circulate the wire to allow even

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,658
temperature distribution this would be

37
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,669
needed if your temperatures falling

38
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,200
below sixty degrees Fahrenheit for

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,269
whatever reason below eighteen degrees

40
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,950
Celsius sometimes a water heater is

41
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,500
advantageous to add depending on your

42
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,880
location of your reservoir but keep in

43
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,618
mind you want to stir that water

44
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,599
otherwise we'll just be a small area of

45
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,400
really warm water and it will cause

46
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,938
stratification in the aquatic

47
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,618
environment you have covers are advised

48
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,750
there should be covers to limit light

49
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,899
and reduce the chance that algae look

50
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,938
growth so want to have some sort of lid

51
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,250
on them it could be simply a piece of

52
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,349
plastic here that eliminates light

53
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,359
penetration it can also help control

54
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,548
water loss prevent unwanted items from

55
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,769
falling into the tank so you see here

56
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,899
there's a cover but there's also a more

57
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,188
solid great cover here through an aiding

58
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,299
from falling in to this reservoir tank

59
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:08,280
lastly having the lids that seals

60
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,349
airtight may initially sound like a good

61
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,848
idea but actually this can cause suction

62
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,560
and reduce the flow of water to the

63
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,030
irrigation system so

64
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,709
while you may want to put a you know a

65
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,598
lid on that I want to make sure that

66
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,670
there's some form of air exchange that

67
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,590
is occurring especially if using pumps

68
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,389
to pump water out when I mix those pumps

69
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,310
working harder and increase the chance

70
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,098
of failure having some sort of

71
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,289
breathability is a good idea you don't

72
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:33,839
want to necessarily have it sealed

73
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:37,049
simply having it mostly covered unsealed

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,180
from the outside from outside light is a

75
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,450
good idea but keeping it sealed so that

76
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,510
it's airtight is not advised because you

77
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,159
can reduce your evaporation loss vastly

78
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:50,389
but is having this cover over it you

79
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,389
don't need to keep it airtight
