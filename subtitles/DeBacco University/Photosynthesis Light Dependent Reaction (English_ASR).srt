1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
so this video could be photosynthesis

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,589
light dependent reaction keep in mind

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,039
that in the description there's a link

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,009
to these slides there's in this video

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,250
I'm gonna attempt to describe this mess

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,600
in front of you here on the title slide

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,730
right now it may not make a lot of sense

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,130
hopefully by the end or maybe watching

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,500
this video a couple times to begin to

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,778
understand some of the complexities here

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,028
and it won't seem so daunting as it does

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,230
right now

13
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:34,140
so moving on our light dependent

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,670
reaction there's protein complexes I've

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,049
found another great link to some

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,780
animations here you're welcome to check

17
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:43,399
that out we're looking at photosystem

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,140
two plastic wine in cytochrome

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,969
photosystem one ferredoxin in ATP

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,230
synthase are some of the protein Calvin

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,300
codes were going to be discussing here

22
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,488
it's gonna help you to understand what's

23
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,019
going on through this process keep in

24
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,858
mind that while this might seem very

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,690
complex we are all dealing with the

26
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,090
chloroplast here keep in mind the stroma

27
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,219
is that aqueous liquid and the thylakoid

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,109
lumen is that inner portion here of the

29
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,060
disc and it shows it right here also

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,790
we're gonna be looking at explaining

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,810
what's going on right here

32
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,130
okay so start with let's look at an

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,340
exploded view here of the light

34
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:18,929
dependent reaction just an overview for

35
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,180
photosystem two excited electron travels

36
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,880
along a series of proteins as we see

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,470
here this electron transport system uses

38
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,978
energy from the electron to pump

39
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:30,599
hydrogen ions across the membrane to the

40
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,938
inner thigh lacroix this is our

41
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,478
thylakoid space a pivot molecule

42
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,699
photosystem one accepts an electron and

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,269
we're using ATP synthase here to

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,000
generate ADP two into ATP so we're going

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,709
to follow this electron along remember

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,799
this is a chain because it only occurs

47
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:52,530
in one direction so starting with first

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,590
photosynthesis Oh photo meaning light

49
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,849
working at a photon of light energy

50
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,399
wavelength of light that's the source of

51
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,929
the initial energy we see our white

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,149
light here getting separated out by our

53
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,920
prism into our different colors notice

54
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,109
those colors have different wavelengths

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,229
and they occur always in the same way

56
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:13,318
jeab is order remember keep in mind this

57
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,890
is visible light we're looking here at

58
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,039
other

59
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,439
forms of different wavelengths here

60
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,359
visible light is a very small portion of

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,039
the electromagnetic spectrum

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,350
and there's a wonderful rainbow to the

63
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,568
double rainbow here light is given off

64
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:31,889
when the electron jumps down one of its

65
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:33,269
levels or more so photosystem 2 now keep

66
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:36,089
in mind that we do start with

67
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,159
photosystem 2 there's photosystem one

68
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,599
that comes later for a system one was

69
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,520
first discovered and actually then they

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,250
found this other photosystem so this is

71
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,510
why it's labeled like this but

72
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,489
photosystem two is we're going to start

73
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,530
with light energy is absorbed by the

74
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,159
chlorophyll molecule and passed along a

75
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,140
pathway to other chlorophyll molecules

76
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,669
the energy in this molecule of

77
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:00,449
chlorophyll is found in the reaction

78
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:03,149
center this energy excites one of its

79
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:05,310
electrons and leaves a molecule to be

80
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,409
transferred to the nearby primary

81
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,229
electron acceptor so we have this

82
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,349
electron here this electron comes from

83
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:15,929
splitting of a molecule of water we see

84
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,810
oxygens giving off as a by-product so

85
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,730
are hydrogen ions and an electron and

86
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,409
that electron is absorbing this light

87
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,349
energy and excited we call it and

88
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:28,769
jumping up that's not just passed off

89
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:30,689
and left to go release its energy it's

90
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,459
through a sequence of steps when its

91
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,620
electron dropped down in energy we're

92
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,870
gonna harness that so we have our

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,250
initial electron ground state we excite

94
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,379
it to the excited state we're giving it

95
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,629
its energy I'm trying to maximize this

96
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,519
energy this is the thylakoid membrane

97
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,379
keep in mind where the stroma is or the

98
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,890
thylakoid space here notice our

99
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,289
phospholipid bilayer here now capturing

100
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,488
light energy in the reaction center

101
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:55,319
different molecules utilize different

102
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,789
wavelengths of light ultimately light

103
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,549
energy is channeled to the reaction

104
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,189
center so we see our Korat annoyed see

105
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,560
our chlorophyll b or chlorophyll a

106
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:07,139
utilizing multiple wavelengths of light

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,489
energy that the Sun is producing to give

108
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,559
an example of some of this it's called

109
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,930
an antenna complex and we see

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,589
chlorophyll b beta-carotene you might be

111
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,139
familiar with it's in carrots lycopenes

112
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,268
in tomatoes we have our chlorophyll a

113
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,060
now that electron is coming from our

114
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,910
water molecule this is going to what's

115
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,810
called ETS this electron is going to the

116
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,000
electronic train

117
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,209
poor system remember that's a one

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,250
direction chain like a Simpson system we

119
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:37,349
split our water molecules so we're

120
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,990
getting our oxygen and we're also

121
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,820
getting hydrogen ions now please

122
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,889
remember hydrogen ions increasing the

123
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,339
amount of hydrogen ions will increase

124
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,840
the acidity or decrease the pH here so

125
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,299
these hydrogen ions are located to the

126
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,209
lumen or thylakoid interior to our

127
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,740
molecules water molecules result in an

128
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,829
oxygen molecule being released

129
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:03,379
you see evident here so it takes two of

130
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:06,329
our h2o is to get our OH two molecule

131
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:10,079
now looking at photosystem to abbreviate

132
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:12,810
PS 2 or P six eighty it's absorbing 680

133
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,759
nanometers wavelength it's the reaction

134
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,889
center that increases electrons energy

135
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,319
to the excited state this high energy

136
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:22,199
state is unstable and the energy level

137
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,779
is lowered through controlled sequence

138
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,129
of steps to learn about keep in mind and

139
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,989
remember that when we split our water we

140
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:31,050
having more hydrogen ions who knows the

141
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:34,110
pH of our thylakoid interior is 4 acidic

142
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,110
and our stroma here the outside is a pH

143
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,759
of 8 slightly basic in photosystem 2 is

144
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,990
where we start we're initially getting

145
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,939
our electron here from our water

146
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,379
exciting it with wavelengths of energy

147
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:48,509
from the Sun in this case plastic we

148
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:54,120
don't hear P Q is how it's represented

149
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:55,610
here it's a mobile protein and it's the

150
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,889
start of the electron transport system

151
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,650
it moves within the membrane within this

152
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,900
lipid bilayer and all tallit passes the

153
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:05,879
electrons off to the next step so we

154
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,699
excited our electron we're passing it

155
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,829
here to this mobile carrier and this is

156
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,569
carrying this high-energy electron to

157
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,399
the next step if we didn't have this

158
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,620
curious electron has released its energy

159
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,449
of randomly it would not be able to be

160
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,449
captured and utilized for the

161
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,699
photosynthetic process set a chrome

162
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:27,029
complex it contains iron kind of put a

163
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,310
picture here of a iron chain this moves

164
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,168
protons or hydrogen ions across the

165
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,839
thylakoid membrane so this requires

166
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,949
energy this is active transport taking

167
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,139
this hydrogen which is in low

168
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:41,209
concentrations here and moving it across

169
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,159
this barrier is phospholipid bilayer and

170
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:46,459
and training it here again remember our

171
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,100
pH here is a civic at pH of 4 and the

172
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:51,228
storms a pH of 8 slightly basic that's

173
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,729
occurring through a constant movement of

174
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:57,800
those hydrogen ions also called protons

175
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:59,839
plus isn't Simon this carries electrons

176
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,360
from the cytochrome it's a mobile

177
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,359
carrier PC as it's represented here it

178
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,189
delivers electrons to photosystem 1 so

179
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,270
it's a mobile carrier trying to remember

180
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,879
that I'm going to put a picture of an

181
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:12,829
aircraft carrier here mobile carrier and

182
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,199
we're looking right here so we've gone

183
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:17,689
through our photosystem 2 we fix primary

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,680
a little up to an acceptor plus the coin

185
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,469
in there we're going to cytochrome

186
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,900
within our electrons I'm sorry our

187
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,610
hydrogen's across with the energy from

188
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:29,870
the electron and now we're going to

189
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:33,199
photosystem 1 so in photosystem 1 it's

190
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,240
similar to photosystem 2 misses

191
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,848
photosystem 1 down here this is for

192
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,780
system 1 for comparison the electron is

193
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:41,569
reenergized

194
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,369
from photons of light energy through the

195
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:46,490
reaction center and now we're

196
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,649
transferring to ferredoxin so this gives

197
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,300
you it's calls called p700 it's a

198
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:52,728
slightly different wavelength of light

199
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,490
we see here our electron being passed

200
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:57,860
off light energy here exciting that

201
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,500
electron you know slow system 1 is

202
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,229
simpler than photosystem 2 because

203
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,759
there's no water that's being broken the

204
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:07,038
electrons that were separated out from

205
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,919
this original water molecule are being

206
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:13,519
passed along this is the same electron

207
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,019
being reenergized here this kind of

208
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,060
gives you a graphical representation of

209
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:19,098
this rienner jet the energising that

210
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,769
occurs so electrons are energized after

211
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:23,478
absorbing energy from the light then as

212
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:25,549
part of the electron transport chain the

213
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,319
energy is released to controlled manner

214
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,658
and able to perform necessary plant

215
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,279
functions this happens twice with each

216
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:33,679
photosystem you lesson different

217
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,838
wavelength so you see here photosystem

218
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,848
two taking our electrons from the

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,399
initial splitting of water energizing it

220
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,039
up passing it down in sequence of steps

221
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,649
along to do work in this case moving

222
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,409
protons or hydrogen ions and then it

223
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,909
reaches photosystem one re-energizes

224
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:51,948
itself with another photon bringing it

225
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:54,409
up and then we're gonna utilize those

226
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,069
steps again so this is what we called it

227
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,319
energizing

228
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,060
electrons bring it up and then as it

229
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,770
comes down we're kind of controlling and

230
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:08,659
utilizing that energy ferredoxin ft and

231
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:11,689
n adp read updates and FR at the end

232
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:13,579
ours were located here now so keep in

233
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,110
mind or look at the thylakoid look where

234
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,759
the stroma is we've gone through

235
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,590
photosystem two in the splitting of

236
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,480
water you'll be energizing with light

237
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,550
energy now we're looking at passing

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,590
those electrons off we're moving our

239
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:26,929
hydrogen ions across concentrating them

240
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,879
in the lumen this will left photosystem

241
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:30,799
two from photosystem observing light

242
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,919
energy and now we're getting to here

243
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:39,589
we're transferring those electrons and a

244
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:41,990
hydrogen ion so creating a proton and

245
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,820
hydrogen ion gradient concentration of

246
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,129
hydrogen ions in the lumen increases the

247
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,980
acidity from increasing acidity to

248
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:50,659
pieces the pH this great natural exit

249
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,820
diffuse across the membrane and even out

250
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:55,909
of the concentrations this generates an

251
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,470
energy potential hydron ion so can only

252
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:00,679
pass through this protein structure

253
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,960
called ATP synthase and this is we see

254
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,639
our cytochrome here moving them across

255
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,460
their only lot of the passed back over

256
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,110
through the process of ATP synthase and

257
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,340
as I do move over ideally with more

258
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,860
energy the cytochrome will pull these

259
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,490
back and to try to maintain this

260
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,269
gradient now what ATP synthase actually

261
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,680
is and now there this hydrogen ion

262
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,319
gradient generates from the electron

263
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,620
transport chain and it's used to run HB

264
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,379
synthase the proton flow results in adp

265
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,230
adenosine diphosphate being converted to

266
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,809
ATP and we see here are either an ion

267
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,269
moving across ATP synthase the reason

268
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:41,449
why you could show this little animation

269
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:47,059
here that actually does rotate and turn

270
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:49,550
and it is converting adp to ATP it's

271
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:51,919
grabbing another phosphate enjoying that

272
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:54,469
from diphosphate to triphosphate our

273
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,769
high energy molecule necessary for the

274
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,050
cell to perform its functions now

275
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,370
hopefully looking here I pose the

276
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:02,990
question does this make sense now

277
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,120
initially I know you're probably going

278
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,100
to say no it is presented a little bit

279
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,899
differently but I welcome you to pause

280
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,420
the video and take a look

281
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:14,208
what everything is labeled and see if

282
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:16,308
you can describe what's going on look at

283
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,409
water molecules our photosystem 2

284
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:20,539
photosystem 1 where the hydrogen ions

285
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:24,948
are occurring ultimately we're joining

286
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:27,289
our NADPH and our ATP so again there's

287
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:28,938
stroma and our lumen keep in mind where

288
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:30,889
everything is where the electrons are

289
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,509
being passed off so again pause the

290
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,360
video here and see if you can explain

291
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,379
this to yourself

292
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,119
hopefully after you explain that makes a

293
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,519
little bit more sense now but you may be

294
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:42,199
wondering I'll wager now is ATP which is

295
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,470
the energy component of the reaction in

296
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:47,479
a NADPH which is the terminal electron

297
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,428
acceptor I throw the electron goes that

298
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,528
was originally split from the water but

299
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:53,269
no sugars remain so when does this

300
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:54,889
happen or it doesn't put synthesis great

301
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,149
sugars well the answer is going to be

302
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,308
the Calvin cycle it's a light

303
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:01,220
independent reaction you know the other

304
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:03,469
videos on that this entire description

305
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,589
here was simply the light dependent

306
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,709
reaction and while the components ATP

307
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:12,050
and NADPH are necessary for the calvin

308
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:14,599
cycle the calvin cycle itself does not

309
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:16,428
require light energy directly that's

310
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,050
going to be a subsequent video and that

311
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:23,088
is where we're going to be using our co2

312
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:24,979
our NADPH are in our ATP and ultimately

313
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,889
we'll be generating that sugar molecule

314
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,379
to allow there to be stored form of

315
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:33,528
energy in a chemical form that

316
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:35,860
originated from an energy or a light

317
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,860
form
