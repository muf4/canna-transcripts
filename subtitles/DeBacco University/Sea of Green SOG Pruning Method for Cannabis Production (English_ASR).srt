00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,359
have you heard about the sea of green

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,960
method of pruning

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,839
for cannabis production but want to

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,839
learn more this debaco university video

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,400
will provide you with some details

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,000
about just that learning more here about

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,839
the sea of green method of pruning to

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,399
see if it's a right fit for your growing

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,399
situation

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,320
[Music]

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
all right let's get into the sea of

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,800
greener sog pruning method

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,079
for cannabis production so first off

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,359
this method is really intended to

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
maximize speed

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,280
the sea of green method was developed to

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,760
maximize the speed of cannabis growth

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
especially if overall height is limited

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,320
and this is

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,959
commonly done in grow tents where you do

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,159
have that limiting of the plant height

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,558
it's also more commonly done with

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,279
starting material is clones versus seeds

24
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,959
however it can be performed with either

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,800
plants can be planted in

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
at densities that are as high as nine

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,479
plants per square foot

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,960
so this is really maximizing plant

29
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,839
number while decreasing overall plant

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,439
size

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
within a short time after being

32
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,478
established the lights will be switched

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,520
to a 12 hour dark period

34
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,359
inducing flowering so the plant height

35
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,879
itself the plants typically should reach

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,359
about 12 inches or

37
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,798
tall or so before you decide to flip

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,319
them and that's basically change the

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
photo period of your lights

40
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,319
from a vegetative photo period 18 plus

41
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,799
hours of light

42
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,239
to 12 hours of light here which is the

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
flowering photoperiod

44
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,359
they should finish around 18 to 20

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
inches tall as far as your plants are

46
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,280
concerned

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
the plants should be grown in three

48
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,280
gallon pots to maximize the density

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,680
with the limit of water stress however

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,439
some growers will choose to utilize this

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
method and grow their plants in only one

52
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,039
gallon containers

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
so simply they can pack more plants in

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,159
but the water frequency will have to be

55
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,000
increased so just keep that in mind the

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,320
goal of this method simply is to

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,359
maximize production we also utilize all

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,199
the space available

59
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,519
particularly when you're lighting it and

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,159
have to have those upfront costs

61
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,359
to maximize flower production so here we

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,719
can see all the containers literally

63
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,159
touching one another can't really get

64
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,919
any denser than that

65
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
and quick turnaround time for the

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,039
flowers

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
now the plant hormone influence with

68
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,199
this uh method uh this relatively quick

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
flip of the flowering photo period

70
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,039
12 12 12 hours of light 12 hours of

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,640
darkness flying duration limits the

72
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,519
plant's overall height how tall they're

73
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,519
going to get

74
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,200
which is great in grow tents this

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,560
induces flower quicker and allows for a

76
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,919
quicker time to harvest a faster

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
turnaround time

78
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,719
the plant density should be high because

79
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
while there is no alterations to the

80
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,199
normal hormone concentrations of the

81
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
plants

82
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,318
because this shift occurs sooner than it

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,239
is

84
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,318
normal overall yield per plant will be

85
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
reduced so growers need to make up the

86
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,958
difference by increasing the overall

87
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,479
plant numbers

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
simply you're going to get less per

89
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,639
plant with this pruning method

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
but by growing more plants you can make

91
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,839
up that difference and sometimes that

92
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
quicker turnaround time

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,158
is more advantageous and if it is this

94
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,120
might be a pruning method

95
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,120
you consider
