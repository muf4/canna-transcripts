1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,519
okay if there's one thing growers can

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,929
use continually improvement in

3
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,960
experience with its diagnosing Clint

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:12,089
problems in a very important skill and I

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,460
encourage everyone to continue to work

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,718
on it it's never a really perfect it's

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,150
always different you're never sure

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,608
exactly what the answer may be in some

9
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,399
cases but something you still should

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,289
still continue to work on and that

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,729
diagnosis thing going the process we go

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,240
through here I'm going to do a couple of

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,340
examples plies and gets you at least to

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,600
get you an idea what you may have so you

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,219
start developing a plan around it you

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,289
just want to say oh the plant died and

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,850
move on well I try to do what cause that

18
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,789
plant to dies you can better plan for

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,399
the future so if you're trying to

20
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,019
diagnose a problem or trying to help

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,299
someone else diagnose a problem first

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,030
you do do is you're trying to get a

23
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,530
correct diagnosis that's your goal you

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,300
don't want to make assumptions because

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,629
if you're just you're trying to get that

26
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,578
to the root of that problem or the real

27
00:00:56,628 --> 00:01:01,170
basic cause to that try not to make

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,710
assumptions the key is to continually

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,420
ask questions of yourself or a person

30
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,849
you're trying to help that continual

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,728
questions because someone may see four

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,048
and then someone may see three so I want

33
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,849
to make any quick assumptions you want

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,130
to kind of look at the situation and

35
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:18,750
just collect some facts and some data

36
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:22,199
before you start going through and

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,640
saying oh that is X Y or Z if you

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,930
parties want try to classify that

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,019
problem I want to talk about each of

40
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,880
these in detail whether it's a fungi

41
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,780
that caused a problem a bacterial virus

42
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:36,868
water and animal the your yourself the

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,060
grower the environment classifying the

44
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,368
problem can really do a lot for as far

45
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,189
as helping you prevent that issue or

46
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:46,828
correcting that issue moving forward so

47
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,629
Simon's fungi it's a very common control

48
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:52,469
by fungicides so I've been up on the

49
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:55,259
sides control fungi they tend in warm

50
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:58,259
moist environmental conditions so

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,780
typically all your mildews you know your

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,909
powdery mildews is a good example of a

53
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,700
fungi that you may see very commonly

54
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,469
occur and it's likes those kind of warm

55
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,929
moist conditions those heavy rains of

56
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:13,030
heavy dudes and warm temperatures cause

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,860
these to really get growing quite good

58
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,930
bacteria is another one they did a favor

59
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,120
warm weather to the point of hot weather

60
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,099
they can multiply faster as the

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,129
temperature rises so if the problem

62
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,629
becomes increasingly an issue as the

63
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,419
temperature gets warmer and warmer this

64
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:30,669
season warms up could be a bacterial

65
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:33,639
disease some the sites remember don't

66
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:36,039
work on bacteria fungi and bacteria are

67
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,109
different you need a bacterial side to

68
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,239
combat bacteria so if you apply a

69
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,980
fungicide and that doesn't really work I

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,150
mean it because the fungicide it's broke

71
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,129
could it mean it because you don't have

72
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,129
a fungus to begin with so that's another

73
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:50,829
indication viruses these are typically

74
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:52,719
insect vectored plants lack an immune

75
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,310
system so you cannot control the actual

76
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,139
substance you can't control the actual

77
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,360
virus you need to prevent the vector for

78
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,759
bringing that virus in so insect control

79
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,100
and clean equipment are very important

80
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,469
this is tobacco mosaic virus got a very

81
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,599
unique look to it might be a little bit

82
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:10,150
more like common cold virus might be

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,430
used seeing what viruses are very tough

84
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,500
because plants lack the immune system so

85
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,709
we want to prevent the virus from even

86
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,530
coming into our fields new treatment

87
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,430
valves so this can be pH related and or

88
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,739
an over or under application of

89
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,180
fertilizer under application means their

90
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,159
plants are starving for a particular

91
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,890
nutrient over application means you

92
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,569
could be blocking certain nutrients

93
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,809
typically it's a field or crop wide

94
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,669
problem pH concerns tend to show up

95
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,379
early in the season if it's kind of

96
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,479
nutrient balance and relate to the pH

97
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,579
problem in nutrients tend to show more

98
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,500
fruit set again not always the case but

99
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:50,349
just indications that you may have this

100
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,780
nutrient problem going on here we see a

101
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,689
citrus crop having some nutrient balance

102
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,219
here's a corn plant corn plants now I

103
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,889
said it's kind of field or crop wide in

104
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:02,229
this case that's not true we see these

105
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,358
corns plants in the back doing quite

106
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:07,599
well the corn here kind of having that

107
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:09,969
yellowing appearance there so again not

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,099
always true but when we see this one

109
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:14,319
doing well one not doing well probably

110
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,649
net disease-oriented at least probably

111
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,959
nutrient oriented or it could be water

112
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:22,239
this is another issue too much or too

113
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,038
little same thing too much water could

114
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,990
be over irrigation could be a leaky hose

115
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:26,849
could be just excessive rain or it could

116
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,710
be too

117
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,560
I don't know how the water flows through

118
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,939
your field the example here conceived

119
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,220
probably where the water kind of

120
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,959
collects and certain plant species can

121
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,120
help indicate where it could be wetter

122
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,888
soil and where that's gonna travel

123
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,090
you can't expect good yields here you

124
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,340
might as well make walking paths or

125
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:45,750
split two fields in this area you want

126
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,189
to check your irrigation line for leaks

127
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,038
or clogs because that can lead to too

128
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,829
much or too little water in Zach's kind

129
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,089
of an imager here other variable each

130
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:56,609
one's got their own little special

131
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:59,219
properties but each has its main time

132
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,530
frame as they show up good idea of when

133
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,320
to expect them degree days can help

134
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,909
predict this very important for some

135
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,788
insects if you're looking at monitoring

136
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,889
and open control measures degree days

137
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:12,569
can help you predict and time your

138
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,500
applications in your scanning

139
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:18,389
accordingly animals they can be really

140
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,209
small like nematodes which I think often

141
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,848
get overlooked - very large this deer or

142
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:26,579
even in some case bare so you want to

143
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:29,240
determine what animals likely to be in

144
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,529
your area whether it's deer deer fence

145
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,840
electric fence for small animals like

146
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,069
chipmunks and squirrels in the Emoto

147
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,779
it's a little bit harder and want to

148
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,719
work on controlling them potentially in

149
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,848
this soil if you can environmental it's

150
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,050
kinda hard to plan for this some of it

151
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:45,029
might be obvious hail damaged

152
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,900
temperature extremes can cause cracking

153
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:51,059
in this case a tree trunk or wind damage

154
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:53,009
tropical storms or hurricanes these are

155
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,110
just saying maybe you can't control but

156
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,639
at least can identify hail isn't

157
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,770
interesting one if it's a distant field

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,569
we don't get to see every day I'm not

159
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:03,538
gonna see the hail or it could not hail

160
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,129
the home but at the field it could so

161
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:06,839
just things to consider you're not

162
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:10,709
saying hail is kind of obvious once you

163
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,629
see it well some fields are distant and

164
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:15,060
the last one is grower error these can

165
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,728
be the hardest to see or realize or

166
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,110
admit to that you messed up here or it

167
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,538
looks like a grower may have applied an

168
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,658
herbicide where they shouldn't have so

169
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,310
just be realistic if it was fine growers

170
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:28,529
rightfully so don't want to admit to

171
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,879
something that they may have done but I

172
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:31,978
also can get the data and collecting it

173
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,930
it's key part is just to realize what

174
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,930
you did and don't do that again
