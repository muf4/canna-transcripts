1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,399
going to be looking at stemophilium gray

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,480
leaf spot in tomatoes in great detail

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,080
not only through images as we can see

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,400
here we're actually going to go into a

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
high tunnel here from the grower see

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,800
what they're experiencing also go on the

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
microscopic levels you can see what this

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
disease actually looks like under the

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
microscope and lastly some new

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,960
scientific research looking at the

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:29,639
genetics and how we may be able to breed

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,640
resistant varieties going forward

14
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,880
[Music]

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,000
all right so let's look at stemophilium

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
great leaf spot in tomatoes here so as i

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,039
said multiple views we're going to look

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,039
at description of the disease actual

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,119
images and video of a known case

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
comparison to a common look-alike a

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,280
microscopic view as well as a genetic

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,120
investigation regarding the virulence

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,480
factor so let's start with just the

24
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,640
basics here you know what are we dealing

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,640
with here about stemophilium well while

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
it may seem like a new problem gray leaf

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,198
tomato was first reported actually way

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,000
back in 1930. there are four different

29
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,679
type of helium species here all provided

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
here we're going to kind of cover them

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,600
in more of a general case here

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,000
what does cause then is there is high

33
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,679
humidity or free water on leaf surfaces

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that's what's required for the spore

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,320
germination as well as infection

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,920
spots on leaves are small light brown

37
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,239
and somewhat circular to irregular in

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,478
shape some larger spots can be seen that

39
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,519
are cracked symptoms do start to appear

40
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:32,239
within two to five days of infection as

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,798
you get an idea of the rate of spread

42
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,199
now the dispersal of this particular

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,240
fungal pathogen is via air currents or

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,719
wind also splashing of water it can also

45
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,478
be seed borne and it also survives on

46
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,679
crop debris as a saprophyte so you want

47
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,920
to make sure you're cleaning your fields

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,759
and removing those of any cases that you

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,439
think you might have had

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,879
this is kind of a zoomed in version here

51
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,599
of what the different leaves kind of

52
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,438
look like and we have the upper portion

53
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,039
and then that same leaf i turned around

54
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,879
and you can see the under portion of

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,320
that same leaf and what you're kind of

56
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
not seeing here is a lot of yellow

57
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,398
haloing keep that in mind seeing this

58
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,679
brown coloration and almost the centers

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
are tan

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,920
so that tan kind of coloration in the

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,879
center with that darker brown region

62
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,119
can be an indication that you may have a

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,318
case of stemophilium

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,759
now here's just another look here

65
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,439
showing a little bit more of advanced

66
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,560
symptoms again upper and lower leaf

67
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,000
surface

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
this more advanced progression is

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
evident by this large kind of browning

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,399
area and the larger lesions located

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,599
under side of the leaf here so a little

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
different we just saw before those are

73
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,518
earlier symptoms these are a little bit

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,039
later stages see an idea of what it

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
might progress to if you're looking at

76
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,959
it on a leaf yourself

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,879
now full leaf view here

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,598
so just a little leaflets there the

79
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,039
images uh shown lower leaves here just

80
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,878
above the pruning point for this

81
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,919
particular grower they are exhibiting

82
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:54,079
more advanced advanced symptoms and we

83
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,439
can clearly see that evident um right

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,879
there and this where i was pruning the

85
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,158
lower leaves so you were just above

86
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,239
those and these are a little bit higher

87
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,318
up showing those early signs when you

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,200
want to actually catch it

89
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,359
now looking here if you do look at the

90
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
in the detailed view at the radius of

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280
the petioles here this is when

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,480
inspecting these areas closely look for

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,158
potentially small rectangular legion

94
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,518
these can be difficult to find but

95
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,878
something else to be aware of when

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,239
you're looking at the leaf you can see

97
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,840
that they're here

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
and there's clearly an evident of one

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,439
right there again not widespread but

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
just something else to look for when

101
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,199
you're doing that field diagnosis

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
now here i'm going to go through a high

103
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,839
tunnel video now it is this is recorded

104
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,280
and uploaded in 4k so i would recommend

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,479
that you do pause the video if you need

106
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,878
to and i'm kind of bring up that hd so

107
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,959
you can see the details this was this

108
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,039
case was officially lab confirmed case

109
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,719
of stemophilium the first symptoms did

110
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,239
occur around mid-july which is about

111
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,400
four weeks prior about a month prior to

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,158
the video being taken at this point it

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
does typically start in the older leaves

114
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,359
and works its way up the plant and

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,598
different varieties will have different

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,439
levels of severity so hopefully like the

117
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,039
quick little video here of the high

118
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,479
tunnel we get to hear from the actual

119
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,079
grower

120
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,438
all right so here we are in the high

121
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
tunnel we're going to take a look at

122
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,959
this demophelium now what we really can

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,120
see is that browning of the tomato leaf

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,920
here and we notice that there's the

125
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,079
small browning area but also the larger

126
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,238
browning area notice how there's no

127
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,560
yellowing or haloing effect of that

128
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,079
yellow around any of those spots now as

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,839
you look our way up the plant we'll

130
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,159
notice that the upper portions tend to

131
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,159
be a normal green coloration with no

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
spotting and we notice those spottings

133
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,800
are more prevalent on the lower ends of

134
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,639
those leafs now we're noticing here

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
again a lower look we know the bottom

136
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319
branches have all been pruned out and

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
removed so keep that in mind we're

138
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,719
looking at that distinctive brown

139
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,879
coloration and that kind of tan center

140
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,080
with no yellow hailing is the key part

141
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,159
here to the visual indication that you

142
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,399
might have a stemothelium

143
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,639
that browning again as as far as goes

144
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,959
this doesn't really form circles it

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
tends to form more of a irregular

146
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,319
pattern looking at the upper portion of

147
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
the leaf a little bit more advanced

148
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,399
symptoms there as i flip the leaf over

149
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
you can see the under side of the leaf

150
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,120
as well there some of those are very

151
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,879
advanced cases others are just starting

152
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,639
another last look here

153
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,159
showing you kind of that early starting

154
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,840
again this plant was officially

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,600
diagnosed so this is a sample was taken

156
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,439
to the lab brought here back now we're

157
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,039
able to look and identify this is

158
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,879
exactly the cause this is the early

159
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,240
stages of it so this would be when it

160
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,199
would be important to go through and

161
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,000
identify it or have a reason of concern

162
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,639
to bring a sample to the lab yourself

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,720
now we can see those browning again that

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
can expand out and cover a portion of

165
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
the leaf but we'll really just have that

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
browning to tanning so let's now go to

167
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,879
the grower and hear what they have to

168
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,159
say i noticed there was spotting

169
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,478
um

170
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,960
throughout the plants i had noticed some

171
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,478
i thought was botrytis as well it was

172
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,318
all looked like alternary but sprinkled

173
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,399
throughout the plants and i think it's

174
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,319
botrytis never seen that before but the

175
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,959
spotting was throughout the plants

176
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,840
um some varieties it this is there and

177
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,599
it doesn't seem to have any effect on

178
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,079
yields or plant health in some varieties

179
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
it was almost like septoria would work

180
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,879
its way up the plant you're looking at

181
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,639
it right now mar noir which is a high

182
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,879
loom from johnny's

183
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,560
uh it's uh i i'm doing it because it's

184
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,639
leaf mold resistant because we had awful

185
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
leaf mold last year

186
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
so if you liked that little grower

187
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
interview there where they got to

188
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,120
explain what they were seeing now do

189
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,879
keep in mind that fact sheets tend to

190
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,800
report that cherry and grape tomatoes

191
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,680
are more susceptible than other types

192
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,520
but based on the observation here we saw

193
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,879
it did that show on i did show on all

194
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,478
the cherry varieties so keep that in

195
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,399
mind but it did not really seem to have

196
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,240
much negative impacts in regard to

197
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,799
overall plant performance in the

198
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,639
all-important yield does most commonly

199
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,079
occur or at least is first seen in high

200
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
tunnels with higher temperatures and

201
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,079
humidity being favorable for the disease

202
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,478
development

203
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,399
now we also heard in uh the kind of

204
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,918
grower talk there uh that they thought

205
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,239
it initially looked like septoria so

206
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,639
this is kind of like a look-alike to

207
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,800
that symmetrium is often mistaken for

208
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
the septoria leaf spot listen early on

209
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,038
keep in mind that simofilian this leaf

210
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,598
right here has more irregular lesions

211
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,839
with brown margins and tan centers the

212
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,839
leaves tend to remain green in areas

213
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,079
that are unaffected and in contrast that

214
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,038
to septoria this tends to be more

215
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,959
circular spots with in the inner circle

216
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,038
a lighter shade of brown in addition the

217
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,439
leaf will typically yellow there so a

218
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,639
little comparison there between a common

219
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,598
look-alike

220
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
now when you look at under the

221
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,439
microscope if you are fortunate to be

222
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,199
able to do that we have the canadian

223
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,000
here on the left and the canadian floors

224
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,360
here

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,759
on the right giving you the idea of the

226
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,439
size and kind of their structure

227
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680
now the kinetic fours here are

228
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,439
specialized hyphal branches of some

229
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,360
fungi that produce canadia so this is

230
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,839
kind of the regular kind of spacing that

231
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,038
we see here and just gives you a really

232
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,519
good zoomed in and clear image of those

233
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,598
now the canadia they have two great

234
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,839
images here the one these are the

235
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,598
asexuals were producing on the connect

236
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,198
four of certain fungi they have the

237
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,478
surface fume we can see that nice

238
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,720
textured

239
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,159
surface view here of the canadian of

240
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
stemophilium

241
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,199
then the section view here we're looking

242
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
at kind of getting away from that

243
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,919
surface area what it looks like here on

244
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,400
this section of view so another

245
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,758
good visual identification if you are

246
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,439
fortunate to be able to look at this

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,639
under a microscope

248
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,680
and i promise going to get into some of

249
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,680
the genetics here so a recently

250
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,080
published research article here looks at

251
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,399
the nlp gene which does encode for

252
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,440
necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide

253
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,200
one abbreviate np1 like proteins called

254
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,880
nlp

255
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,240
now when we're looking at all the data

256
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,000
here you might want to pause the video

257
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,480
i'm just going to cover over the

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,559
brief overview of this we have the wild

259
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,879
type here so that's kind of what it

260
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,879
would look like under normal conditions

261
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,039
and then we have gene knockouts and we

262
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,480
have over expressing here if we look at

263
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,000
the graphs here that kind of represent

264
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
the same leaves that were grown on the

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,159
plant and then removed only for the

266
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,278
image you see the wild type the gene

267
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,759
knockouts here showing less or smaller

268
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,838
lesion sizes than those that were up

269
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,000
regulated there looking at this

270
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
particular gene there

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,759
now what are the study findings again i

272
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,600
know they found out quite a bit so it's

273
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,958
great to look at some of the details

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
this was not particularly from the study

275
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,319
but just kind of highlight some of the

276
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,320
lesions they were talking about and

277
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
through their analysis of the nlp gene

278
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
which remember encodes for necrosis and

279
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,958
ethylene inducing peptide one like

280
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,800
proteins it was found that targeted

281
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,679
disruption of the nlp gene in

282
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,639
stemophilium significantly compromised

283
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,278
its virulence in tomato the nlp

284
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,600
suppressed the production of reactive

285
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,919
oxygen species abbreviate ros and tomato

286
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
leaves during stemophilum infection

287
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,199
expressing the fungal nlp in tomato

288
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,759
resulted in constitutive

289
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,720
transcription of immune response genes

290
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,559
and inhibited plant growth so this is a

291
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,240
great kind of target area when we're

292
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,319
looking at developing potential

293
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,360
resistant varieties as far as we got it

294
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,278
down to the actual gene that is defining

295
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,519
potentially the virulence factor for

296
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,879
this disease in tomato

297
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,278
and just kind of the last little bit

298
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,200
right here nlp might contribute to the

299
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,919
virulence of stemophilium by suppressing

300
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
the rms immediate immunity in tomatoes

301
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,479
large-scale functional genomic studies

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,440
are required to further dissect the

303
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,360
pathogenicity of stemithelium so this is

304
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
kind of an early indication but shows

305
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,240
promise as a way we might be able to

306
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,760
suppress this disease going forward but

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,759
at least now you've got a little bit of

308
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,159
an idea of what to look for in the field

309
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,319
as well as under the microscope

310
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:44,600
if you think you potentially have this

311
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,600
fungal disease on your tomatoes
