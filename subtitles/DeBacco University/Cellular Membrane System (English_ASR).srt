1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,439
okay here i'm going to be going over

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,080
some of the

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,839
cellular membranes located within a cell

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,400
and a lot of these will apply to both

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
plants

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,719
and animal cells so starting off with

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
just a general parts list you can see

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,679
located just below me here

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,519
a typical animal cell as an example but

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,439
again a lot of these will apply to both

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,439
so these members organelles these

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,359
organelles that have membranes

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,719
most obvious we have the plasma membrane

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,118
and that's responsible for

15
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,358
regulating what comes in and out of a

16
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,359
cell we have the nucleus which is where

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,640
most of the dna is kept and that's where

18
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,719
we're going to be

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
cell will be regulating the expression

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
of those genes

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,840
for those dna sequences the mitochondria

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,839
is your energy or atp

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,360
synthesis portion of the cell and

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,120
remember those are located in both

25
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,119
plants and animal cells

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,399
unlike the chloroplasts which are energy

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,679
for carbon fixation

28
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,439
found only in plant cells we also have

29
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,039
the endoplasmic reticulum which is your

30
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,640
protein processing and membrane

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,760
synthesis and there's both rough and

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,840
smooth

33
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,759
the golgi which is responsible for the

34
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,799
modification and transport of

35
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,319
vital proteins within a cell vesicles

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,439
responsible for taking things

37
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,199
in in little compartments and also

38
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,758
things leaving or exiting

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,359
the cell and we have some non-memory

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,680
structures just to point some of those

41
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,879
out ribosomes they're just responsible

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
for protein synthesis

43
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,959
they don't have that specific membrane

44
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,280
bound we have the cytoskeleton which is

45
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,399
for cell structure and strength

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,118
and so mobility and transport within

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
a cell moving materials throughout the

48
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,920
cell there

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
also when we talk about mitosis and cell

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,719
division some of those components can be

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,560
involved

52
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,640
and we have the extracellular matrix

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
which is responsible for cells adhering

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
to one another cells moving

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
and cells kind of interacting or

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,320
communicating

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
certain proteins with other cells in the

58
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,000
area

59
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,519
so an animal cell as i mentioned we just

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,718
kind of have some of those membrane

61
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,200
proteins here

62
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,239
uh we have a nice little diagram here

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,240
locating

64
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,478
uh and pointing them out what they look

65
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,920
like in in a general sense at least in a

66
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,759
cartoon image

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,598
they give you kind of an appreciation

68
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,959
for all those little components within

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,399
an animal cell

70
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,319
it wouldn't be complete unless we had a

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
plant cell and you could see this here

72
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,318
and a lot of the same components as well

73
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,439
some a little bit larger for example the

74
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,399
vacuole

75
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,199
is much larger in a plant cell so this

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
endomembrane

77
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,039
system so we're looking at this entire

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,120
kind of how this works

79
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,959
together this is a series of membranes

80
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
that are part of the cell and because we

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,280
have these membranes we have these

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,919
little compartments

83
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,759
and this allows isolation of specific

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,159
components within the cell

85
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,120
the true system here involves the

86
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,159
nucleus with the

87
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,719
nuclear envelope the rough and smooth er

88
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,400
the golgi apparatus the vesicles

89
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,840
to help this kind of whole process kind

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,159
of come together

91
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,039
they're located in this kind of vicinity

92
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,919
and this

93
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,120
sequence to allow those genes to be in

94
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,919
the nucleus

95
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,519
to be able to produce final proteins

96
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,079
that may be used within the cell or

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,519
excreted outside the cell

98
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,000
some of these little protein structures

99
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,599
contain enzymes so enzymes are a

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,919
specific type of protein

101
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,759
they catalyze the removal of electrons

102
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,238
and associate hydrogen ions looking

103
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,239
specifically here at the peroxisomes

104
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,319
so they have their own little kind of

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,239
membrane creating this little vesicle

106
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,318
they're very similar to a lysosome they

107
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,319
have a membrane-bound

108
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,798
kind of container here containing

109
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,439
enzymes however these peroxisomes

110
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,120
have active in lipid metabolism that's

111
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,680
the breakdown of fats

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,439
they have oxidative enzymes peroxidases

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,120
for fatty acid oxidation

114
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,280
they catalyze reactions to produce

115
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,680
hydrogen peroxide h2o2

116
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,799
this is very toxic and will be broken

117
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,920
down into water

118
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,438
in oxygen gas by catalase

119
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,639
enzyme in plant cells and also in animal

120
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,359
cells which is often

121
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
not regarded there are vacuoles so they

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
are found in both

123
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,518
they're for food storage and water

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,239
regulation

125
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
the membranous sacs and are larger than

126
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,200
a small

127
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,199
vesicle they store materials that are in

128
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,479
excess and they can be very specialized

129
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,878
now in the plant cell they're quite

130
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,478
large and pronounced they are present in

131
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,238
animal cells but tend to be equate

132
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,238
smaller

133
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
these vacuoles looking here at a plant

134
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,478
cell

135
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,399
typically we have that one central

136
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,918
vacuole can be up to 90 percent of the

137
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,799
volume of those cells we kind of see

138
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,039
that here

139
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
they function in water storage nutrients

140
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,879
pigments and waste products

141
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
development of trigger pressure as well

142
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,279
some functions

143
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
performed by lysosomes in other

144
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,319
eukaryotes so i say turgor pressure this

145
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,799
is think of it as

146
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,000
water pressure within a cell and that's

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
what's allowing that

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,519
kind of swelling and contracting it's

149
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,599
kind of like water pressure

150
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,439
more specifically that turgor pressure

151
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,080
in plant cells

152
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,959
that kind of water pressure is what's

153
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,439
maintaining

154
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,478
the osmosis within a cell whether if

155
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,680
you've ever seen a plant that you

156
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,719
haven't watered in a little while it's

157
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,639
kind of wilted

158
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,160
uh kind of getting that kind of wilted

159
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,478
look to it has a very low

160
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,759
turgor pressure uh plant cells have that

161
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,879
cell wall they want to maintain that

162
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,038
high that

163
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,120
turgid pressure you want to keep that

164
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,879
kind of plant upright those stems

165
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
upright and able to move water through

166
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,439
the plant

167
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,519
and when they kind of lose that target

168
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,399
pressure they what we call

169
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,120
become flaccid or wilted on the initial

170
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,638
onset

171
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
and that's what's kind of going on here

172
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
at a cellular level that water is
