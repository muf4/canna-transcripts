1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
here I'm going to cover some common

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,839
cannabis nutrient deficiencies and some

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,750
of the characteristic looks that these

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,120
may have we could see here all these

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,969
plants leaves don't look quite right

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,399
some of it is due to light damage but

7
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,469
other abiotic factors some is also

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,118
related to nutrients being able to

9
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,129
distinguish and identify those is

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,618
important to any efficient rural

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,089
operation so first off we're looking at

12
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,368
nutrients we want to consider mobile

13
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,800
versus immobile nutrients mobile can be

14
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,808
translocated from older growth to newer

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,429
growth tissue this means that the

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,530
deficiency of these nutrients will first

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,149
show up in the older plant material it's

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,969
kind of being stolen from those older

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,219
leaves and shifted to those newer

20
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,960
growing leaves immobile nutrients are

21
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,879
essentially fixed in place as kind of

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,609
the broken-down car kind of represents

23
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,589
in the plant and as a result they don't

24
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,808
translocate very well so the newer

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,750
growth will tend to show those first

26
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,399
signs of deficiencies when we're looking

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,259
at nutrients want to classify them

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,090
there's three main categories the

29
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,739
primary nutrients are the major

30
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,990
nutrients needed by the plants in large

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,240
quantities this is the three numbers on

32
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:12,269
the fertilizer the NPK the nitrogen

33
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,649
phosphorus and potassium secondary

34
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,810
nutrients are needed in smaller

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,580
quantities and primary nutrients in the

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,700
three secondary nutrients are calcium

37
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,920
magnesium and sulfur lastly of the

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,560
micronutrients and these are required

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,290
nutrients by the plant but in very small

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,829
quantities some in micronutrients are

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,939
boron chlorine copper iron manganese

42
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:37,919
molybdenum nickel and zinc now these

43
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,859
were look at fertilizer options there's

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
chelated of fertilizers and these Gilead

45
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,840
fertilizers are often more stable and

46
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,578
plant available sources of nutrients so

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,890
something if possible to get these are

48
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,959
usually advised because this improves

49
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,118
the fertilizer use efficiency by the

50
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,039
plant fertilizers in this category can

51
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,379
often be used as fullier applications

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,090
applied to the leaves in addition to

53
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,459
being media applied which can help

54
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,500
reduce the time the plant remains

55
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:06,389
nutrient deficient so let's get into

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,759
some of the nutrients division see here

57
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,590
well we'll start with nitrogen it's a

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,349
mobile nutrient often associated with

59
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,810
the degree of green at the plant

60
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,849
as the efficiency is yelling of lower

61
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,159
leaves and fertilizer recommendations

62
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,449
our urea calcium nitrate or blood meal

63
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,479
if you're looking at a pure organic

64
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,729
option now looking at this example here

65
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,859
of nitrogen deficiency you could see the

66
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,689
newer growth is green and the older

67
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,190
growth is yellow because that nitrogen

68
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,199
is mobile so it's being stolen from its

69
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,349
older leaves and pushed to the newer

70
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,239
growth at least at the early onset if

71
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,189
this is allowed to continue eventually

72
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,780
all the leaves will turn yellow but the

73
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,569
initial onset that matters is being

74
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,039
moved by the plant to that newer

75
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,769
material here this is why it looks nice

76
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,329
and green phosphorus is also mobile

77
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,790
nutrient it's often associated with

78
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,830
adding for increased root growth in

79
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:57,539
flower production deficiency is

80
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,910
characterized by a purple coloration of

81
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,530
the leaves as we see here even though

82
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,229
this is not the only possible cause for

83
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,319
purple coloration other stresses can

84
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,489
also call purple color that is something

85
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,799
that's typically associated with

86
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,600
phosphorus triple super phosphates a

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,520
great fertilizer to remedy that and also

88
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,379
manure with the amount of bloom

89
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,110
fertilizers most growers use this tends

90
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,729
not to be an issue it's typically the

91
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,460
other case where growers are over adding

92
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,229
the phosphorus potassium is a mobile

93
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,390
nutrient often associated with sugar in

94
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,879
production of fruit yield deficient in

95
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,259
Zemun by yelling of the leaf margins and

96
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,049
what is that well the margins are the

97
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:36,120
very outside of the leaves here that's

98
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,770
what we see in this image these margins

99
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,569
are yellowing and this is a clear

100
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,630
indication that this plant is probably

101
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,639
done showing potassium deficiency as a

102
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,900
result a sulphate potassium of deaths

103
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,439
and chloride are recommended as

104
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,240
fertilizer

105
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,219
keep in mind potassium chloride has a

106
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,980
higher nutrient content about 10% more

107
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,979
somewhere around 60 percent of potassium

108
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:59,729
but also has a greater salt content than

109
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:01,409
potassium sulfate which is about 50

110
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,359
percent potassium so again they want to

111
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,069
weigh different fertilizer options but

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,440
at least knowing this plant is potassium

113
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,659
deficient gives you a great way to

114
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,550
target particular fertilizer within your

115
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,379
plan so that this doesn't happen in the

116
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,630
future

117
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,819
calcium is an immobilization with cell

118
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,379
division and formation deficiency is

119
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,269
evident by 70 of newer growth that

120
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,569
typically has brown spots in our pearly

121
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,159
forming a flower or blossoms we've grown

122
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,149
tomatoes very from those calcium

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,660
deficiency as

124
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,849
awesome and rot where the calcium simply

125
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,290
not getting through all the tissue

126
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,259
fertilizer recommendations Botanica

127
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,740
cal-mag Max and biome in calcium are

128
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,449
examples of plants available calcium

129
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,660
fertilizers they can help remedy this

130
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,250
potential deficiency magnesium is

131
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,919
another one this is a mobile nutrient

132
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,050
often associated with proper chlorophyll

133
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,879
formation deficiency is evident by

134
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,340
what's called interval yelling of the

135
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,740
leaves you see that here fertilizer

136
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:02,339
recommendation are epsom salts and that

137
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,930
enter kind of you know yellowing this is

138
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,538
a good comparison while not cannabis

139
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,759
plant between adequate magnesium to low

140
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:10,500
magnesium the veins maintain their green

141
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,990
color and in between them we start to

142
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,168
get that yellowing that develops this is

143
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,240
magnesium sulfur is another immobile

144
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,639
nutrient often associated with nitrogen

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,949
fixation in a plant deficiencies looks

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,079
similar to magnesium but tend to be more

147
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,689
even yellowing not broken up yellow

148
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,668
spots like the magnesium and it can be

149
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,069
of greater concern in colder soils in

150
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:34,589
particular typically that newer growth

151
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:37,139
will show kind of that overall dulling

152
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,029
or yellow in coloration absolute salts

153
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,918
is recommended you want to avoid adding

154
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:44,418
straight sulphur and this will also

155
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:47,219
change the pH of the growing media

156
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,870
copper is another immobile nutrient and

157
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,060
while not very common it can have severe

158
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,348
negative impact on yields often

159
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,360
associated with blood formation and

160
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:56,310
development in deficiencies and the

161
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,139
younger leaves the tip or margin or

162
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,970
discoloration we see the kind of tip of

163
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,759
this leaf curling up and looking kind of

164
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,740
that brownish this is kind of

165
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,908
characteristic of a copper deficiency

166
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,158
copper sulfate or other chelated copper

167
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,240
products would be advised if you are

168
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:12,418
spraying them on the leaves to be

169
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,870
careful because it can cause a chance or

170
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,579
greater chance of leaf burn iron is

171
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,079
another immobile nutrient often

172
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,149
associated chlorophyll production and

173
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,589
great plant metabolism deficiencies

174
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:24,689
effluent by the upper leaves turning

175
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:27,089
yellow and is often confused with

176
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:29,250
nitrogen deficiency as a young looks

177
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:31,978
similar to nitrogen but again lower

178
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,478
leaves in the iron for the upper leaves

179
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,759
so nitrogen will occur in the lower

180
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,038
leaves iron occurs in these upper leaves

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,360
here we want to watch the pH and

182
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,829
particularly high phosphorous can

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,319
negatively impact the

184
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:44,849
bility of iron to the plant chelate

185
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,790
forms of iron would be advised to

186
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,700
correct this potential deficiency last

187
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,460
thing we have manganese MN in in mobile

188
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,959
nutrient often associated with

189
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:57,149
photosynthesis respiration and root cell

190
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,939
elongation deficiencies have some

191
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:02,339
reasons to iron deficiency as its

192
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,829
interval yellowing chlorosis of the

193
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,139
newer leaves because he it looks a

194
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:09,419
little different than the iron is kind

195
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,860
of that more even tone fertilizer

196
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,590
recommendations would be manganese

197
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,199
sulfate or if you're using age old grow

198
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:19,649
the grow blend has shown elevated levels

199
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,509
of manganese based on tissue tests so

200
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:23,549
again some fertilizers will have higher

201
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,649
of one of these kind of more minor

202
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,420
nutrients so like tissue testing and

203
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:31,799
testing your plants you can have an idea

204
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,569
of exactly how that fertilizer may react

205
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,579
to the plant and what for love you may

206
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:38,040
use if you are starting to noticing the

207
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,419
beginnings of a deficiency the earlier

208
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,970
you can catch it the quicker you can

209
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,770
correct it and the reduction in the

210
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,490
problem you'll have in your end result

211
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,490
in yield
