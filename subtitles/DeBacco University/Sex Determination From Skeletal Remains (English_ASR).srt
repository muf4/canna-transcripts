00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,678
welcome to this video here on debaku

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,798
university looking at

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:09,439
sex determination from skeletal remains

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,160
so you find uh bones of an unknown

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,239
origin

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,839
can you classify them or determine

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,000
whether they came from a male

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,359
or female we're going to go over some of

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,719
the things to look for

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,519
when making this determination so first

11
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,038
off just a general overview

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,118
informative features are based on

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,279
biological differences between the sexes

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,198
and even races males are generally

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,238
taller and more robust

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,840
than females the pelvis is the best bone

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,039
to inspect with the differences in

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,360
additions

19
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,558
to childbirth with the female tending to

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
have a wider

21
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,000
pelvic region so again that's the ideal

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
bone if you're given

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
the full skeleton to look at but there

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
are differences even in some of the

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,000
other bones as well

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,119
looking at the skull and the mandible

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
for example

28
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,640
uh we're looking at a male and female

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,558
scale if you look at them really quickly

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,119
you might say well they're basically the

31
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,878
same

32
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,399
but we want to look at is some of the

33
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,478
details

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
for the male the critic the cranial mass

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,280
is more blocky

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
and tends to be more massive than

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
females which are rounder and tapers

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,799
towards the top

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
we're also looking at just the general

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
comparison if you look a little closer

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,640
at these

42
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,400
the female having a little bit of a

43
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,560
thinner kind of appearance

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,840
overall uh that tends to be a little

45
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
more um

46
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,799
evident with the zygomatic bone which is

47
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,158
more pronounced in the male skull and

48
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,960
that's basically kind of right under the

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
eye here

50
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,919
the mandible of a female is more rounded

51
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,118
i can see that down here at letter d

52
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
while the male is a little bit more

53
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,200
squared males have a deeper cranial mass

54
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,919
so here we're looking at the

55
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,520
side look of the skull e the distance

56
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
would be greater here for the male than

57
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,158
the female

58
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,560
is there just again a couple quick

59
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,359
comparisons we're looking at a male

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
and female skull to be able to tell the

61
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,840
potential

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,680
gender or sex of that individual looking

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
at the pelvis as i said

64
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
probably one of the better bones to look

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,159
at because of the

66
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,240
clear distinctiveness between the male

67
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
and the female so keep in mind we have

68
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,560
the male here

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
on the left column and the female here

70
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
on the right

71
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,679
and there is a multitude of differences

72
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
the most obvious is looking at the pubic

73
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
arch here

74
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
with the male being approximately 60

75
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,399
degrees

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,040
and the female being typically at least

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,439
90 degrees if not usually 100 or more

78
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,039
we see that also evident up here where

79
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,598
that female definitely has that wider

80
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,318
region

81
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,878
than the male to aid in childbirth also

82
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,119
have the

83
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,959
pelvic inlet being very different here

84
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,599
uh for the female it's more round and

85
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,360
oval

86
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,280
and for the male it's kind of a little

87
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
smaller and almost has more of a heart

88
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,719
shaped to it

89
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
there's also some other differences the

90
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,560
sacrum

91
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,318
is shorter and wider and curved and more

92
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,439
posterior in the female

93
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,560
and in the male the sacrum is longer and

94
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,719
more narrow

95
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,759
so again we have two to compare these

96
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,439
are some nice

97
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,439
clear and obvious visual differences

98
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,079
that can be made

99
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,759
we can also use some of the long bones

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,560
so normally the long bones

101
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,318
alone are not used to estimate gender

102
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
however if these bones are the only

103
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,479
bones present

104
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,318
there are characteristics that can be

105
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,518
used for sex determination again not the

106
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,359
ideal bones to use

107
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,439
but if that's all you're given we can

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
make some inferences based on even just

109
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,799
using

110
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,079
long bones using the humerus in

111
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,040
particular

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,000
here we're looking at measuring the

113
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,679
humerus there'll be a certain

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
characteristics to look for

115
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,200
the transverse and vertical diameter of

116
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
the head region

117
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,199
so that's kind of where it articulates

118
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,039
if the upper arm here

119
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,719
the width between the epicondyles and

120
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,280
the total length of the humerus can be

121
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,598
used

122
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
to help classify or potentially classify

123
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,798
it as being originating from a male

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
or female individual you can see some of

125
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,000
the measurements that would be taken

126
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
here in the image

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,759
now characteristics of the male and

128
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,199
female humerus we're looking at when we

129
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,158
look at transverse diameter we're

130
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,839
measuring it

131
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,679
the vertical diameter the width between

132
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,400
the epicondyles the length of the

133
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
humerus

134
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
we can see in general kind of this table

135
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,438
gives us an idea and based on the

136
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,839
measurements we get

137
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,199
where it might fall and be classified

138
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,400
keep in mind that there are some

139
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,318
measurements that just can be

140
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,079
cannot be determined this is why

141
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:16,560
typically long bones aren't the sole

142
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,358
source

143
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,238
used for determining characteristics of

144
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,359
a male or

145
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,120
female individual when we use the

146
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
femur so keep in mind this is the

147
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,840
strongest and longest bone

148
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,519
of the human skeleton male femurs are

149
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,599
stronger and longer than

150
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,279
female femurs and the diameter of the

151
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
head of male humor is greater than that

152
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,879
of

153
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
the female femur so when we're kind of

154
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,360
making that kind of comparison of the

155
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,399
general length and diameter the head

156
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
circumference

157
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,758
the weight again when we're comparing

158
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,519
the two the male tends to just be

159
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,240
a little bit larger and bulkier in

160
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,560
relation to the female

161
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,560
looking at the characteristics here of

162
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,280
the male and female femur

163
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,319
again some of the same apply as we saw

164
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,679
with the humerus

165
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,000
keeping in mind that there is still that

166
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
undetermined region there

167
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,918
taking the vertical diameter of the head

168
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
here of the

169
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,240
bicondyle width as well and the

170
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,079
trochanter length of the femur is are

171
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,639
some of the measurements we would take

172
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,519
for comparison and we look at a database
