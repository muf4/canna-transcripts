1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,919
going to go over some of the timing of

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,960
cannabis compounds and how they're

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:17,359
accumulated

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:19,199
within the cannabis plant

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,118
all right let's get into timing of

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
cannabis compounds here looking at from

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,118
a scientific standpoint

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,719
so first off some data here if you want

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,920
to look at the original data always try

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,839
to include that

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
and that is here at the cornell hemp

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,600
association

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
they have a great little um information

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
that they've posted

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,558
online the link is right here i'll be

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,640
pulling some of the highlights of that

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,280
data here it's from a 2019

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,759
cbd cultivar trial so they were

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,079
comparing total potential cbdt

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,519
over time and they have their kind of

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,079
data presented right here

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,559
so total cbd and total thc accumulation

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,878
curves

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,558
for the 30 cultivars that they tested

26
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,479
and here's the color and here are the

27
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,558
cultivars they chose to use

28
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,799
most cultivars accumulate high levels of

29
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,518
cannabinoids by week two or three

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,399
and the top 10 centimeters of shoot tips

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
were sampled

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
and cannabinoids were qualified using an

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
hplc

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
high pressure liquid chromatography

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
across

36
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,200
most cult of our studies these cbd and

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,280
thc trends

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
seem to be similar but there are a few

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,478
standouts so when we look at the data in

40
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,560
general we're kind of seeing this

41
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,118
general trend or this increase here

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
overall

43
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,118
of our kind of cannabinoids here and

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,840
this is looking at cbd and this is

45
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,400
looking at

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,759
thc however there are a few standouts

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
and i tried to highlight those here on

48
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
our next

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,079
slide right here so two cultivars listed

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,519
here

51
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,879
peak their cbd levels before thc reaches

52
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,719
the maximum levels

53
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,560
however what i want you to realize is

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,200
that both of these produce tg levels

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
above

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,478
the federal limit of 0.3 threshold

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,399
so if we're looking at thc this dotted

58
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,679
line represents the federal threshold of

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,359
0.3 percent

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
and we could see this about all these go

61
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,799
well in excess of that

62
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,438
however the two that i'm highlighting

63
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,680
here try to put in yellow and we can see

64
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,758
that our cbd versus thc

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
towards the end here you know looking at

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
weeks you know say

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,439
seven and eight or so six seven and

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,239
eight you can see there's definitely a

69
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,759
dramatic

70
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,878
increase in the thc levels while the cbd

71
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,759
levels remain the same

72
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,598
if not trend slightly downward overall

73
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,439
so it's just important to remember

74
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,119
that if we're playing very close to that

75
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,800
line of 0.3

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
waiting to the very end in some

77
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,719
cultivars might cause the crop to go

78
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,199
what's called hot or go

79
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,639
above that theoretical threshold now

80
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,958
these examples they were above it

81
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,559
even before that point so it doesn't

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
really apply to this situation but just

83
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
again

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,719
something else to consider when you're

85
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,878
looking at choosing a cultivar and

86
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,719
knowing what it might be producing

87
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,479
trying to maximize your cbd production

88
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,120
but may go above that thc

89
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,439
threshold now most as i said we'll

90
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,800
exceed that 0.3 percent total thc

91
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,199
however this is notable in some

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,239
cultivars it is possible for thc levels

93
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,479
to increase

94
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,759
in the later weeks into flower so again

95
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,560
this is where choosing that cultivar

96
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,239
knowing your cultivar is very important

97
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
not in this case but in other cultivars

98
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,840
this may be close to the 0.3

99
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
threshold and this could be a notable

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,800
observation and that's kind of where

101
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,159
you're taking the canvas plant and

102
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
saying are you in the hemp plant

103
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,759
category

104
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,679
or in the marijuana plant category now

105
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,359
another research article here

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,439
welcome to take a look at looks at the

107
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
accumulation of bioactive metabolites

108
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,680
in cultivated medical cannabis again

109
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
summer provided here

110
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,080
so what are cannabinoids accumulation

111
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,679
where are they exactly accumulated

112
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
well cannabinoids are synthesized and

113
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,120
accumulate in unfertilized

114
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,199
female inflorescence which is basically

115
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
the flowers specifically within those

116
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,318
flowers the trichomes that are found on

117
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,839
the surface of the

118
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,318
flower and also the leaves the trichomes

119
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,158
are these

120
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,518
small white structures that we see right

121
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,519
here and we can see

122
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,120
definitely excessively produced right

123
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,158
here these other white structures here

124
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,519
are called the stigmas

125
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,158
we're looking at the trichomes being

126
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
these small white kind of structures

127
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,919
here

128
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,719
that look like they have like a little

129
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,158
like mushroom type head on the top

130
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,080
so what's the kind of schema for

131
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,759
developing the cannabinoids now the

132
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,439
cannabis we're talking about here

133
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:16,238
could be a delta 9 thc could be cbd

134
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,358
or cbc now we're saying there's a lot of

135
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,839
complicated kind of

136
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,758
biosynthesis pathways a lot of enzymes

137
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,519
involved in genes in the pathways

138
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,600
have been kind of isolated to kind of

139
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,399
get an idea of where these are derived

140
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,000
from

141
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,519
when we're looking at the very early on

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,918
this uh transferase

143
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,639
we're kind of looking at the kind of the

144
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,680
starting

145
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,120
molecule here would be cbga that's kind

146
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,959
of where we're starting all this the

147
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,680
plant kind of produces that

148
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,279
to synthesize the production from that

149
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,040
particular compound

150
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,638
so once we have the cbga the plant then

151
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,319
can produce the thc

152
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,560
synthase cbda synthase or cb

153
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,599
cbca synthase we're getting that next

154
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
kind of step there

155
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,759
we're producing the thca cbda and

156
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,080
cbca now we then have the heat

157
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,879
or decar carboxylation step to generate

158
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,758
those final

159
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,959
end products with also carbon dioxide

160
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
given off

161
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,799
so based on the inheritances the

162
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
chemical phenotypes the genes for tca

163
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,879
synthase

164
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,239
uh cbda synthase are considered to be

165
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,839
co-dominant alleles

166
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,079
what does that mean that goes back to

167
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,839
our biology basic biology

168
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,000
codominant alleles well alleles you've

169
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,239
got one chromosome from the

170
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
male and one chromosome from the female

171
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,918
co-dominance mean they can both

172
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,120
be expressed one's not going to be

173
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,478
dominant and recessive

174
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,000
they're going to be both expressed

175
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,519
that's kind of an important note when

176
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,439
we're looking at developing

177
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,120
varieties or kind of looking at this

178
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,240
pathway in more detail

179
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,399
the gene for cb ca synthase is

180
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,680
in is an independent locus so it's in a

181
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,879
different location

182
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,079
within the entire genome however based

183
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,079
on dna sequencing

184
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,120
and analysis one of the transcription

185
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:58,159
expressed in marijuana in hemp samples

186
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,280
multiple linked loci for the t h c a s

187
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,840
and t h sorry and the c b d a

188
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,559
s genes are proposed so here we're

189
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,000
having

190
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,160
that even though these might be

191
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,160
distinctly separate in our pathways

192
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
there could be linked as far as

193
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,080
genetically and that's important for

194
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,918
looking at developing new varieties

195
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,120
there are published genomes for cannabis

196
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,359
and the genetic diversity of the

197
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
biosynthetic pathways of cannabinoids in

198
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
both marijuana

199
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,038
and hemp strains is under investigation

200
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,318
we're trying to better understand

201
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,839
these particular pathways because some

202
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,759
growers some breeders might be looking

203
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,719
at producing more cbd

204
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
how can we go about that versus thc and

205
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
staying below that

206
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600
federal limit potentially so if they all

207
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,519
originate from the same molecule

208
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,759
how do we try to get the plant to select

209
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,639
for this particular pathway

210
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,919
because that's deemed to be advantageous

211
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,639
and then lastly we have the kind of

212
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:49,918
bioactive

213
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,519
forms of the cannabinoids so the

214
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,879
bioactive forms of cannabinoids are

215
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,279
produced following

216
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,079
a light or heat induced decarboxylation

217
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,159
reaction

218
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:03,680
to generate the cbg the delta nine thc

219
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,199
the cbd or ultimately the cbc

220
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,199
so all of these kind of are kind of

221
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,000
getting into the specific pathways of

222
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
the plant

223
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,439
might be a little bit more kind of

224
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,038
in-depth and complicated there

225
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,160
but i think it is kind of interesting

226
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,279
just to kind of have an idea an

227
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,960
appreciation

228
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,399
that we have an original molecule and

229
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,680
then from there the plant is going

230
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,758
through with enzymes

231
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
activating different pathways to produce

232
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,280
these different compounds

233
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,038
so this kind of is great for looking at

234
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,119
research going into the future

235
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,959
we're trying to select one of these

236
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,918
particular cannabinoids

237
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,918
over the other
