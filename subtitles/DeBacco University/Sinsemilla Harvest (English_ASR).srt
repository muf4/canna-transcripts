1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
okay here I'm going to go over at

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,509
sensimilla harvest for cannabis and we

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:06,809
see two buds here that fit this up quite

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,269
well

5
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,289
keep in mind sensimilla refers to not

6
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,910
being pollinated

7
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,649
if these alpha hours have been

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,298
pollinated they would shift their energy

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,820
into seed production and reduce the

10
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:21,350
resins and cannabinoids that were

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,149
typically seeking for growing cannabis

12
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,010
now this sense Mill harvest typically

13
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,719
occurs about six or twelve weeks after

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,269
plants have been exposed to an even 12

15
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,559
hour light to our dark photo period in

16
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:33,479
the ranges little broad because of

17
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,820
different cultivars keep in mind

18
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,039
autoflowering varieties will not

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,539
necessarily follow this because they are

20
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,859
not sensitive to changing photo periods

21
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,719
when we're looking at determining and

22
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,369
timing that harvest the tricone color is

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,010
what's going to determine the peak

24
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,049
ripeness the trichomes because they

25
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,849
produce the resins their color is a key

26
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:58,019
indicator when peak ripeness it does

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,600
occur the goal is to get a developed

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,198
translucent kind of feet white trichome

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,840
with a large bulb on top too early

30
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,118
these trichomes structures will be thin

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,650
and clear and not fully mature and too

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,349
late the structures of a brown tea and

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,090
orange coloration keep in mind though

34
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,280
some cultivars tend to produce more

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,340
darker trichomes at maturity so be

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,618
mindful of what cultivar you're actually

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,469
growing how do you determine this color

38
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,090
well it's my observation you want to

39
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,429
inspect those trichomes with a 30 X

40
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,710
looped as a strong LED light built in

41
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,380
this way you can expect and determine

42
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,989
exactly when to harvest I mean it takes

43
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,339
me a little getting used to here but it

44
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,809
really allows you to magnify those

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,960
trichomes to make it much easier to

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,100
determine exactly when they're ripe now

47
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,688
what are you looking for the goals to

48
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,309
harvest went about half of the observed

49
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,319
trichomes are faint white and

50
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,240
translucent color I kind of give the

51
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,819
idea of the jellyfish here that's that

52
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,158
faint white to translucent color now if

53
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,868
you're a small detailed operation you

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,549
can even select the individual buds for

55
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,340
harvest to ensure each one's you moved

56
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,000
at the exact correct day and this kind

57
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,978
of gives you a little bit that

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,899
real-world image of kind of how it

59
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,758
should look if you're a small operation

60
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,789
you can select the individual buds often

61
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,079
that's not the case so when it inspect

62
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,859
some representative sample buds that you

63
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,600
have

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,240
and you're looking for that translucent

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,560
the faint white color what about half of

66
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,180
the trichomes in the bud have that

67
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,860
that's when you can go through and

68
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,330
harvest and as you start to learn a

69
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,070
cultivar you'll start to know how many

70
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,230
days since you flipped the lights that

71
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,239
will produce this and allows for a more

72
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:33,030
efficient operation but the key part

73
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,060
here is to have a good magnifying loupe

74
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,919
use your observations watch the buds and

75
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,969
don't get don't harvest them too early

76
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,530
or too late

77
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:42,780
catch that peak ripeness so you get the

78
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,110
maximum yield for the effort that you've

79
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,110
put in
