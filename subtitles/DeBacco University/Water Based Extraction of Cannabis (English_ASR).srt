1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,599
are you considering water-based

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,599
extraction of your cannabis plant

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,278
well this tobacco university video will

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,519
provide you some more details

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:16,429
to see if this extraction process is a

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:19,679
good fit for your situation

00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:20,960
[Music]

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,960
all right let's go over water-based

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
extraction of cannabis

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
so first off with water-based there's

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,199
actually two main

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,278
extraction methods both are solvent-free

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,280
concentrate which customers are often

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,920
looking for and there's cold water

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
and then there's hot water extraction so

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,359
first off looking at the cold water or

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,599
ice water extraction method

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,519
this utilizes a solvent-less method of

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,359
extraction that submerges finely chopped

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,160
cannabis plant material into freezing

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,238
water

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,839
the plant is stirred in the cold water

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,439
causing the trichomes to separate

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
off from the plant and once the

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,878
trichomes fall off the plant it will

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
pass through a series of screens

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,000
the end result is a product that has 50

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
to 70

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,159
percent thc levels so this is again

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,640
something that can be

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,478
very easy to do and doesn't require a

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,799
ton of equipment

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,640
then there is hot water extraction so

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
this uses pressurized hot water

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,879
you can see this kind of more equipment

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,438
here it offers the advantage of being a

37
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,118
safer alternative to other extraction

38
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,719
methods if you want to learn more of

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,000
those other extraction methods

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,840
here in debacle university you can

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
search some of those videos the

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
protocols

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
are developed to select against thc in

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,759
some conditions

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,520
the optimal conditions to extract more

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,640
cbd cbc

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,599
or cbg then thc and cbn

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,680
were set at 150 degrees celsius 160

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,519
degrees celsius in 45 minutes

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
as extraction temperature the

51
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,679
temperature at the collector vesicle

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
and the extraction time respectively so

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,880
this can show you

54
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,559
how this method still can allow some

55
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,839
degree of specificity

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
and it's much more than just taking

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
cannabis with some kind of cheesecloth

58
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,359
and some boiling water and pouring it

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,799
through

60
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,319
description of this pressurized hot

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,118
water method showing a little image

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,118
right here

63
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,200
the desired sample is placed in the cell

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,280
for extraction the cell is then heated

65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
to a predetermined temperature

66
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,318
the system is then filled with water and

67
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,399
then pressurized

68
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,399
the sample is then kept at the exact

69
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
conditions until sufficient breakdown of

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
the solutes is achieved

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
so that duration of time will kind of be

72
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
set by protocols

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,120
the used solvent is then let out of the

74
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,319
cell and the extraction solvent is

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
forced through a system

76
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,878
for a predetermined time known as the

77
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,560
dynamic extraction time

78
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,959
the resulting sample is then rapidly

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,199
cooled in ice water using a glass flask

80
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,719
to prevent degradation of the extract

81
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,399
so here we can see the solvent system we

82
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,280
see the pump the flow direction

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,800
preheating extraction cell uh black

84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,159
pressure regulator and then collecting

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
flasks and this would be chilled

86
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,840
down here as part of the pressurized hot

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
water system

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,439
another reason what's the resulting end

89
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,159
product well the trichomes are what's

90
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,759
removed

91
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,759
this is a closed-loop system and will

92
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,840
produce a thick goopy substance ranging

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,759
from a yellow to a brown coloration

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,200
different temperatures and pressures

95
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,239
will result in different end product

96
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,919
consistencies

97
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,360
typically thc levels range in the

98
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,559
seventy to ninety percent

99
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,760
uh range the advantages of a water-based

100
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,239
extraction method is that the

101
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,959
elimination of additional sample cleanup

102
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,080
reduction in organic solvent consumption

103
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,719
highly selective

104
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
extraction efficiency ease of automation

105
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,800
and the cheap solvent

106
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,318
goods mainly using just water now lastly

107
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
there are some disadvantages with any

108
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,639
method

109
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,719
and for water-based extraction it's a

110
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,039
relatively expensive startup cost

111
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,000
can have long residence times of

112
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,079
extracts which has

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
an increased risk of phytochemical

114
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,879
degradation

115
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
so keep those in mind and if you don't

116
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,079
think this is a fit you might want to

117
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,679
explore some of the other methods

118
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,519
to see if one of those might be a better

119
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,519
fit for your given situation
