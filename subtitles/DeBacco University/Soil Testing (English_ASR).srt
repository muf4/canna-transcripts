1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,159
you're gonna look at soil testing

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,419
provides analysis of the soil so what

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,280
you do is you take a representative

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,710
sample from the field you sent it to a

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,689
lab and they work on extracting certain

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,750
nutrients from the soil and report back

7
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:17,789
to you I want a sheep you email and they

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,129
can mail it to you and it's a great way

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,840
for you to find out information about

10
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,919
what's going on in your field but it's

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,929
kind of hard to see

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,170
definitely observe it can save you a lot

13
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:31,859
of time so often I get asked the

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,420
question is it worth $20 you know it

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,690
worth the cost and that's $20 just an

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,730
average the information you can't see

17
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,099
and my opinion one of the best twenty

18
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:44,429
dollars you can spend on a field the

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,649
benefits are great and the cost are low

20
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,509
so that's why I highly recommend soil

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,179
testing even if you're looking at an

22
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,558
area for pH you may not have to go

23
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,899
through and do the complete soil

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,780
analysis but sometimes I'll even tested

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,489
field multiple times during the year

26
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,549
typically in the spring and also again

27
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:03,390
in the fall how many sample locations

28
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,890
well you can take three different

29
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,719
samples in various fields it might be a

30
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,670
good field a bad field in average field

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,158
you I didn't want to sample these

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,290
separately at least for the initial test

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,890
here the example is we have a wooded

34
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,469
area a vegetable garden a low-lying area

35
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:25,079
some green grass but you want to sample

36
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,459
an area that's fairly consistent so you

37
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,200
could see in this low-lying area

38
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,478
low-lying area there's some yellow spots

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,820
well those sample locations are outside

40
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,618
of those yellow spots I would test those

41
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,118
separately just to get an idea what

42
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,670
would be going on there could be a pH

43
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,680
issue could be something else the

44
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,090
vegetable garden set is sampled

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,579
separately than the wooded area then the

46
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,770
green grass has many different locations

47
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:48,179
at least to start with and then if you

48
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,280
determine all these to a very similar

49
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,810
these two are the same in the future you

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,329
could reduce your number of samples but

51
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,890
initially just trying to get an idea as

52
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,289
many different areas as you think

53
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,210
possible your goal is to get a

54
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,250
representative sample so this is your

55
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,438
population you want your sample to be

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,090
within that population in the soil lab

57
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,030
is only as good as a sample that you

58
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,430
send them so proper sampling technique

59
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,140
is your responsibility and take time

60
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,800
with it there's many different ways they

61
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,329
can still get

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,330
accurate results with not just one way

63
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,960
it's a spade shovel I can do a soil

64
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,060
auger a soil tube doesn't really matter

65
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,909
as long as you're consistent and able to

66
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,360
get that sample within your population

67
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,620
in this cases to be your field so how

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,420
does sample well pop your sampling

69
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,250
technique and equipment it's not really

70
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,809
all that complicated you want to take

71
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,759
out random I always say six to nine

72
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,250
samples per area that's about six to

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,579
nine inches deep pretty easy to remember

74
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,349
six nine samples six to nine inches deep

75
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,910
the goal is you don't want to go much

76
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,319
deeper or much shallower than that this

77
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,689
is the root zone this is where your

78
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,180
roots are going to be exposed to so

79
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,530
tools of the trade official stainless

80
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,180
steel probe you can use I've used those

81
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,439
in the past they make it really easy if

82
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,210
you're doing a lot of samples

83
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,849
particularly walking on large corn

84
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,439
fields or I use sometimes inch and 1/2

85
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,229
PVC pipe and sledgehammer and a pail and

86
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,939
a bag you take the PVC pipe you want

87
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,179
straight ideally take your sledgehammer

88
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:14,550
put the plastic bag in the pail I pound

89
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,430
the PVC pipe into the soil I knock out

90
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,600
soil I take another walk pound on the

91
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,969
ground again another six to nine inches

92
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,889
put it back in the bag take that bag out

93
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,569
when I'm done with that field label the

94
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,609
tie take another bag out of my pocket

95
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,289
but it back in the pail go through do it

96
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,590
from another field mix it pretty quick

97
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:32,669
and easy to do so it doesn't have to be

98
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,860
all that complicated

99
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,869
I like inch and a half because the soil

100
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,670
comes out of this pretty easy if you go

101
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,289
much smaller especially if it's a little

102
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,239
bit rained recently or it's a wetter

103
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:44,579
soil might get really jammed in there

104
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,689
pretty good inch and a half I can wrap

105
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,320
it a couple times with a sledgehammer

106
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:51,959
and usually it falls right out so we're

107
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,280
to test there's many different labs more

108
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,590
cost does not necessarily mean better

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,830
tests universities provide great quality

110
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,080
results I've tested at multiple labs and

111
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,570
they all give pretty consistent results

112
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,390
I know certain people that spend a lot

113
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:08,280
more than I do on soil tests and I've

114
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,829
looked at their results and they give

115
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,840
you some more information some more

116
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:17,459
ratios and a little bit different

117
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,350
information as far as details based on

118
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,668
the results but pretty much I just want

119
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,140
to see the numbers and results that we

120
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,149
can work on balance in the soil from

121
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,680
there so just because you're spending

122
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,579
more in this case does not always mean

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,668
it's it better

124
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,050
test for the results tell you remember

125
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,250
it's not the total nutrients I think

126
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,930
it's a big misconception

127
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,389
it's an estimation of the plant

128
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,968
available nutrients soil test results

129
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,218
provide the extractable nutrients you

130
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:43,079
don't care how much potassium is in the

131
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:45,000
soil you want to know how much is

132
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,158
available to the plants and that's what

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,199
soil tests try to do this is why if you

134
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:50,788
send two samples from the same field to

135
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,199
the same lab - and I test them to see

136
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:54,149
and they come back with different

137
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,189
numbers and you think that they're

138
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,049
giving you wrong results well they're

139
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:59,759
not there's a certain amount of

140
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,520
variability that occurs it'll be very

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,319
close about that but they won't be the

142
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,878
exact same number we're getting an

143
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,460
estimation they're trying to knock off

144
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,110
these nutrients from the soil and

145
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,870
determine what's available to the plant

146
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,090
because the soil test for plants doesn't

147
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,218
matter how much you have in the soil and

148
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:19,468
wants another portion of that nutrient

149
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:22,379
that's extractable and ideally available

150
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:24,629
to the plant a lot of vast majorities to

151
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,340
here of the potassium phosphorus is

152
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,990
bound up in the soil not available to

153
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,359
the plant so that's not what's a soil

154
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,389
test measure to measuring extractable

155
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,800
nutrients nitrogen why is it so

156
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,210
difficult to test whether sometimes not

157
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,430
test for it why do some ones used to

158
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:40,198
test for and don't anymore well to get

159
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,838
an accurate result need to do nitrate

160
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,449
test measuring is in constant flux it's

161
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:47,848
constantly changing I keep in mind the

162
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,180
lab will test and generate an accurate

163
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:53,668
result for the lab but if this doesn't

164
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,579
represent Muirfield it's not valuable or

165
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:57,329
worthwhile if you want to have a

166
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:59,158
estimation of the nitrogen that's in

167
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:01,139
your field and the Jun nitrate test is

168
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,750
the best way to do that it's taken in

169
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,550
June you want to sample down 12 inches a

170
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,930
little deeper and you don't want to put

171
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,848
in a plastic bag I'm gonna put it in a

172
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,759
paper bag so it breathes you want to get

173
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,500
to lab as soon as possible typically

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,479
people will sample and drive it directly

175
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,310
to the lab to get the most accurate

176
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:20,418
results that represent their field

177
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,418
conditions as possible
