1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
so you may have heard the term in gene

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,889
therapy in the news well here we're

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,550
going to learn a little bit about that

4
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:10,710
process and how it's been used so first

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,599
off what is gene therapy in general well

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,540
gene therapy introduces healthy genes

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,839
into cells that lack them so as first

8
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,399
used successfully in the year 1992 girls

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,920
were cured of a rare blood disorder

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,858
caused by a defective gene and the girls

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,990
remained healthy even well beyond that

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,820
so what this is in the most basic form

13
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:32,609
is kind of repairing genes or fixing a

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,869
broken gene it's finding in identifying

15
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:38,250
a region or a gene that is defective

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,979
identifying that area and replacing it

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,469
with a healthy gene and allowing that

18
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,869
cell then to replicate causing that now

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,300
normal or healthy gene to proliferate in

20
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,788
the cells however this has other cases

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,979
in implications one example would be

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,020
cloning of animals so here's just an

23
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,979
example of Dolly the sheep

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,809
how is Dolly the sheep clone produced

25
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,289
well it's through this kind of concept

26
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:07,019
of gene therapy now the successful

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,210
embryos about 30 and 277 tries so again

28
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,609
a great percentage were transplanted

29
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:15,359
into a surrogate mother sheep well this

30
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:18,299
process looked like so well even though

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,700
only one in 270 tries was successful in

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,310
July 5th 1996 Dolly was born

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,549
how would that process go about well you

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,930
take that donor cell from a sheep and we

35
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,270
extract extract

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,100
the nucleus is extracted from that so

37
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,519
this in this case only the nucleus is

38
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:38,118
being used we have this egg cell taken

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,649
from an adult female sheep and that

40
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,569
nucleus of the egg cell is removed so

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,149
essentially essentially from this sheep

42
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,219
we have the egg cell components in

43
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,680
machinery and from the sheep we only

44
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,118
have the nucleus through an electrical

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,220
shock process that nucleus is

46
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,859
transferred into that fused egg cell

47
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,890
that egg cell then is induced to divide

48
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,718
normally that single fused egg cell will

49
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,728
then produce an embryo that embryo will

50
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,789
be placed into a foster mother and that

51
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:08,909
foster mother will ultimately have the

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,920
cloned sheep as a offspring so the

53
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,780
embryo develops normally and that baby

54
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,899
lamb is produced in this case it was

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,370
Dolly

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,560
since Delhi scientists have successfully

57
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,269
cloned sheep mice cattle goats and pigs

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,699
hell of our problems and complications

59
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,188
still a lie arise leading to premature

60
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:27,459
death not really sure why that's the

61
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:30,639
case but dolly died in 2002 having lived

62
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,140
only half a normal sheeps life so while

63
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,089
the process does make sense that were

64
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,738
just taking the nucleus from one in the

65
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,259
egg cell from another you're still a

66
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,739
potential for shortened life

67
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:44,709
expectancies now UConn has gone through

68
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,840
with large animals and in 1999 in the

69
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,289
first of the first first cloned calf

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,700
from an adult farm animal on and non

71
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:53,709
reproductive cells the United States

72
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,939
that name was Amy and Amy has given

73
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:59,259
birth to one hundred and three pound

74
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:01,239
calf in 2002 now if we look here this is

75
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,158
kind of the mother if you will these are

76
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,590
the clones you could see that they also

77
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:08,679
have a very similar kind of white

78
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,989
triangle on the top of their head there

79
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,629
and they're all the clones and I forget

80
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:16,049
all their names but it it was a B C D

81
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:20,858
and E they had the name acute letter

82
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:22,629
ABCD and ian's was at UConn so stem cell

83
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,519
basics how this is all as possible well

84
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:26,608
it's through the process of stem cells

85
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,569
so stem cells have a very unique

86
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,459
characteristic to them they're what we

87
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:32,408
call pluripotent and that means they're

88
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,419
capable of forming an entire organism

89
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:37,030
one cell can form basically all the

90
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,250
components of an organism as development

91
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,109
proceeds cells lose their pluripotency

92
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,419
so they become committed to one type of

93
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,069
tissue and these are called adult stem

94
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,889
cells because they still have the

95
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:50,078
genetics to produce anything but they

96
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,849
themselves kind of become specialized it

97
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,329
only produce one particular type of cell

98
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:56,469
so since you arise from just one cell

99
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:59,139
that had to have the ability to perform

100
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:02,139
and produce all these different tissue

101
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,729
types however as you get older heart

102
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,819
muscle cells tend to produce more heart

103
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:08,919
muscle cells and neurons for the short

104
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:11,108
at least first two years they can

105
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,699
produce more neurons intestinal cells

106
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,530
produce more intestinal cells they

107
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,169
become more specialized they start to

108
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,329
lose that pluripotent miss that that

109
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:22,299
originally had when were very very young

110
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,949
now we're looking at stem cells there's

111
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,079
some benefits and some drawbacks

112
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,699
so benefits and black stem cells could

113
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,430
be used to restore tissues lost

114
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,659
damaged due to accident or disease

115
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,389
experiments have already been tried and

116
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,610
successful in mice damaged spinal nerves

117
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,399
as I mentioned nerve cells don't divide

118
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,199
for very long to your life so damaged

119
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,629
spinal nerves can be partially repaired

120
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,180
it can help someone recover from a

121
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,100
spinal cord injury might be paralyzed in

122
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,990
parts so some of the benefits to stem

123
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,600
cells some of the problems I was finding

124
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,550
a source especially for those embryonic

125
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,890
stem cells harvesting them from

126
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,170
discarded embryos Rises ethical issues

127
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,029
are appealing unborn babies and then

128
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,980
there's also the possibility of an

129
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,569
immune system rejecting them so

130
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,069
implanted stem cells will likely be

131
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,800
rejected by the immune system of the

132
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:11,560
individual so it's important to realize

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,230
some of the benefits but also be mindful

134
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,720
of some of the issues or problems when

135
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,730
you're making a decision going forward

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
these are things that science has to do

137
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,550
is constantly balances the pros with the

138
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,549
cons
