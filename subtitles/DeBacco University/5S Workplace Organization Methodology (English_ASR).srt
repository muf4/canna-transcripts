1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
okay here I'm going to go over the five

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:09,000
s workplace organization methodology see

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,410
the five parts listed out here and then

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,689
explain them each in a little bit more

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,480
detail they keep in mind this

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:17,250
methodology of five s refers to five

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,710
Japanese terms used to describe the

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,109
steps of the five s system for visual

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,580
management on the following slides a

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,320
tunnel for the American term will be

11
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,299
stated and I will put their Japanese

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,789
term in parentheses I will only be

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,250
referring to the American term here it

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,899
is basically what this is in general

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,950
this methodology is having an organized

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,299
clean efficient workspace so the first

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,920
one is sort and want to sort through

18
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,479
your materials keeping only the

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,939
essential items that needed to complete

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,128
the task you want to ask yourself what

21
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,808
do you actually need go through

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,609
everything and if you do not need it get

23
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,738
rid of it think of it it's like making a

24
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,689
survival kit you know keeping only the

25
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,820
essentials laying everything out do I

26
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:59,009
need all these different lenses ask

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,350
yourself exactly what do you need to

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,929
have then they're set in order and

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,629
that's organized in and ensure that each

30
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:09,868
item has a day designated in logical

31
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,658
place maybe you want to keep some items

32
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,069
you typically use more at eye level

33
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,570
though so you use a little bit less that

34
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,059
are light on the top there's a little

35
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,679
heavier here at the bottom location of

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,868
the items should be easy to find in

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,659
access and also labeling everything

38
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:27,030
makes it really easy to identify you can

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,710
see also here at the bin system locating

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,469
all the glue the highlighters the

41
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,530
sharpies the rulers all very nice neat

42
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:37,170
everything is set in order then there's

43
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,219
shine proactive efforts to keep the area

44
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,490
clean and orderly to ensure

45
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:44,340
purpose-driven work clean and maintain

46
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:47,158
the organized workspace that can be also

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,049
including an area for cleaning materials

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,149
it also be just having everything laid

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,770
out very well and efficiently this

50
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,659
convolve routine tasks are just sweeping

51
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,849
the floor removing dead leaves and

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,140
performing maintenance on equipment this

53
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,059
is really what causes the operation to

54
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,879
shine the key part to make this work

55
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,040
efficiently is that it's proactive

56
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:08,250
you're doing this ahead of any potential

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,959
issues then standardize when a create a

58
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,878
set of stairs for both organization and

59
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,800
a process you can develop your own

60
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,109
parameters that fit within

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,360
other previously described terms they

62
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,000
suggested though that schedules are a

63
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,470
good way to approach this having a

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,669
timetable having it by the days of the

65
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,289
week having it by the time of the day

66
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,209
that can be a great way to standardize

67
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:30,209
things much as we see here with the

68
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,820
pallets for shipping it's a standardized

69
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,879
way to ship large products forklifts are

70
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,819
used and becomes very easy to transfer

71
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,469
that from one place to another they have

72
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,689
sustain and that's sustaining new

73
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:44,669
practice practices and reflect on your

74
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:48,509
actual practices to ensure you're

75
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,949
following this 5s methodology the system

76
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:52,259
doesn't work unless it's continuing a

77
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:54,569
regular repeated basis over time want to

78
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,729
sustain this method you just want to do

79
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,129
it once and unchanged want to implement

80
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,929
this and in a way that can sustain

81
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:03,389
itself so that you're continuing with

82
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,490
this efficient workplace environment for

83
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,899
the long term to not only make your

84
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,020
current employees I'll work very

85
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,730
efficiently but anyone that make them in

86
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,530
but might be new can easily pick up the

87
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,769
tasks and fit right in with everyone

88
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,770
else
