1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,299
okay here okay as the title suggests

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,069
isotopes and half-life so first off

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,559
again defined what an isotope is all

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,420
atoms of an element have the same number

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,820
of protons which is an important thing

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:18,448
to remember but may have different

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,760
number of neutrons isotopes are two

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,279
atoms of an element that differ in the

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,260
number of neutrons keep in mind the

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,899
number of protons will define the

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,210
element so you see here our three

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,368
examples here are all hydrogen where

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,420
hydrogen because they each have one

14
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,700
proton

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,460
they each also have one electron here

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,040
we're only looking at the change in the

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,469
number of neutrons so here there's no

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,439
neutrons protium here there's one

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,070
Neutron deuterium and here we have two

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,890
neutrons

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:55,350
pterygium these are all examples of

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,039
isotopes of the element hydrogen now

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,760
isotopes

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,870
there's also reactive isotopes and

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,299
radioactive isotopes at that kind of

26
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,219
dangerous they're unstable indicate

27
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,739
spontaneously they give off particles

28
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,989
and energy not all elements are

29
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,399
radioactive so there's some that are

30
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:13,530
definitely a lot more likely to be

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,409
radioactive and that all elements

32
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,530
necessarily have radioactive isotopes

33
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,780
that at least occur in nature so the

34
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,640
half-life it's the time required for the

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,909
amount of radioactive material to

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,670
decrease by half again we're looking at

37
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,979
some take a very long time some take a

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,159
very short period of time so the

39
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,560
radioactive nuclei our time half-life

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,609
the time it takes for half of the

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,920
material to decay so the same general

42
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:47,640
trend will be for all the elements we

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,969
see here the time it takes so this time

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,680
measurement is going to be different so

45
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:58,078
this time it takes for half the material

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:02,250
to decay for uranium 238 is 4.5 billion

47
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:04,639
years so extremely long period of time

48
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,399
for half that material to break down

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,580
carbon-14 has that time it takes this

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,259
distance would be five thousand seven

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,719
hundred and thirty years

52
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:21,658
and if you get to like some other like

53
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,039
potassium-40 1.25 billion years so I

54
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:26,848
don't you think they always take a very

55
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,370
long time business to 14 this house life

56
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:31,619
will only last about 19 point 7 minutes

57
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,860
all the way down is very unstable at

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,370
last well well under a second so the

59
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,440
graph will look the same but the time

60
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,650
distance will be very different

61
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,829
depending on the particular isotope that

62
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,610
you're dealing with based on the element

63
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,860
so if you look at here decay of

64
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,170
carbon-14 see our sample in years

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,750
percent of carbon-14 atoms we started a

66
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:58,708
hundred percent half-life of our

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,870
carbon-14 universe 5730 years so they

68
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,209
reached 50 percent here would be about

69
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,250
five thousand seven hundred thirty to

70
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:09,299
decrease 50 percent by half would be

71
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,549
about 25 and we see five thousand seven

72
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:14,069
thirty plus five hundred five thousand

73
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:16,829
seven I'm 32 just over or ten thousand

74
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:18,509
here we notice that that trend continues

75
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,819
we see here the dots that are

76
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,620
disappearing throughout the half-life we

77
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,289
very rarely reached zero get very very

78
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,480
close but we're always dividing by two

79
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,000
that's how we get this general curve

80
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,959
that occurred that occurs when referring

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to half-life lastly our applications are

82
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,950
radioactive isotopes through dating

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,739
fossils tracing atoms through metabolic

84
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:43,199
processes in diagnosing medical

85
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,359
disorders these half-life's that we have

86
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,179
rather put in the body that aren't

87
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,400
extremely radioactive or deadly we can

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,109
trace and track where things may go

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,159
through the body because we know

90
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,250
carbon-14

91
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,449
for example the body or the plant is

92
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,120
going to take that in this regular

93
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,979
carbon some of the more shorter isotopes

94
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,859
or half-life's that we deal with for

95
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,229
isotopes we'll be able to track and see

96
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,939
where those are in the body but it's not

97
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:11,039
going to recognize it as oh that's an

98
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,689
isotope it's gonna treat it like it just

99
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,539
a normal element and that allows us to

100
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:19,529
track and see through these radiographs

101
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,819
here these scans this is iodine 123 to

102
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,559
see where that may accumulate in the

103
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:23,639
body what organs what tissues that may

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,408
accumulate in

105
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,968
we're looking specifically at carbon-14

106
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:32,728
it's very long half-life 5730 years as

107
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:35,218
we say here that's good for fossil

108
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:38,008
dating not great for Edo

109
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:39,538
radiology here because it's so long here

110
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,250
we have to track well how old were those

111
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:43,468
rocks how old were those fossils our

112
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,379
plans that allows us to give us an idea

113
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:48,978
based on that decay that occurs when

114
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,000
that first carbon was assimilated

115
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:55,968
hopefully this helps explain a little

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,968
bit about isotopes and half-life for you
