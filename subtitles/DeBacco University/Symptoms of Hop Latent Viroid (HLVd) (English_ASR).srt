00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,559
in this debaco University video If you

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,939
think you've got hop late and viride

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,339
well here I'm going to go over some of

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,720
the symptoms of this virate to see if

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,759
they match up to what you might be

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,760
seeing or should be on the lookout for

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,600
[Music]

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,219
all right I'm going to go over some of

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,199
the symptoms of hoplite and thyroid and

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,820
we can see it's quite variable some are

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,920
coloration changes some are

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,219
morphological changes

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,859
so first off I want to really give you a

14
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,299
good resource this Canon Med 23

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:41,340
presentation by Dr zamir punja provides

16
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,078
some of the great images here I saw

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,219
screenshots from the presentation he

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,460
gave if you want to hear from him

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,260
directly buy sure check this link out

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,179
here in the description I've got all my

21
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,759
references to some other sources I used

22
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,378
as well but another good resource to

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,820
take a look at

24
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,619
so first off I want you to understand

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,719
that while the disease could be the same

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,759
or the virus can be the same the looks

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,400
can vary two canvas plants infected with

28
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,798
the same virus can have a wide degree of

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,420
different visual symptoms so test the

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,939
same but there's different ways they can

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,978
be infected to catch it early does take

32
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,478
a trained eye and seeing a lot of plants

33
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,159
and seeing satellite infected plants

34
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,260
allows you to pick it out a little bit

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,420
sooner you can see we have stunting

36
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,460
obvious here vegetative plants pre-flour

37
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,560
high syceptibility of genotypes are

38
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,059
stunting sometimes the roots will be

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,500
affected and not really getting a great

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,299
proliferation of roots even though

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,459
they're not discolored and then the

42
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,180
inflorescence or the flowers can also be

43
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,639
infected so really affects Roots shoots

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,220
as well as final flower

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,019
stage of development does have um and

46
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,179
impact so keep that in mind that while

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,560
symptoms you may see are in part

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,020
dependent on the stage of development

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,299
the plant and also when and physically

50
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,118
on the plant where the point infection

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,740
may have occurred early flying plants

52
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,780
can tend to be the most symptomatic or

53
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,699
plants going into flower is where you

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,680
tend to get that you can see here

55
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,600
stunting that occurs different changes

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,299
in morphology all things that kind of

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,758
just this don't quite look right

58
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,500
common symptoms again while this seemed

59
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,839
like a pretty long and extensive list

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,699
slow growth like I said something or

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,180
those kind of decreased internode

62
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:20,280
spacing leaf malform malformations leaf

63
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,120
chlorosis can mimic an iron deficiency

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,140
so kind of over here in these images you

65
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,878
can see it kind of looks like an iron

66
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,919
deficiency with those upper leaves being

67
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,979
a little lighter in coloration lighter

68
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:34,799
green to Yellow coloration Leaf corrosis

69
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,479
is a symptom brittle stems reduced root

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,879
formation as we can see the comparison

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,019
between the healthy and infected

72
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,939
horizontal growth that can grow up like

73
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,860
an exponential curve so it kind of gets

74
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,280
a little bit more of this distinctive

75
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,920
kind of u-shaped Parabola shaped a great

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,259
relief overlap reduced water intake

77
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,318
flower destruction smaller and less

78
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,539
dense basically equals reduced yields in

79
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,000
the end which is not good

80
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,679
there's also been evidence of this stem

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,860
or node swung I'm not sure how common

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,599
this is but another YouTube video it's

83
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,879
shown this that they got a positive case

84
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:11,280
this is a confirmed case of hoplate and

85
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,079
thyroid may not be commonly reported but

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,360
it definitely does happen this kind of

87
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,239
node swelling that we see here very

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,040
distinctive something very unique that

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,539
would stick out might be an indication

90
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,639
if you're seeing that you might want to

91
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,739
get that plant tested

92
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,899
now this can vary greatly on the plant

93
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,459
so this is why when sampling different

94
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,439
portions of the plant should be taken

95
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,239
special attention to the roots for

96
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,340
hopling bad can initially accumulate in

97
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,840
this area you can see here where we're

98
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,658
getting high point value negative and

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,319
positive that the THC percentage went

100
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,939
from 27.8 down to 15.9 we lost some

101
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:46,259
terpenes so

102
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,180
keep in mind that the smaller flowers

103
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,219
are the bundle plant due to high plate

104
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,620
and Virus Infection had 42 percent lower

105
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,120
THC and 15 percent lower terpenes

106
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,099
compared to normal sized healthy flowers

107
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,860
on the same plant great information

108
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:01,798
again provided by in that presentation

109
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,480
linked at the top as well some others in

110
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,700
the description

111
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,399
now this can vary by cultivar so this is

112
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,438
gaining a lot of interest and rightfully

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,640
so and while there are no cultivars that

114
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:13,919
have been shown to be completely

115
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,680
resistant to Output enviroid there are

116
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,560
some early data indicators that some may

117
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,639
be more tolerant than others this could

118
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,199
potentially be used as part of a

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,120
breeding program if this can show

120
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,040
consistency so this is right now in the

121
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,079
early stages but there definitely does

122
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,060
seem to be some variability to

123
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,659
resistance

124
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,459
um

125
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,439
or at least tolerances to say no one's

126
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,659
really resistant at least tolerance I

127
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,120
love these kind of really close zoomed

128
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,400
up images of the trichomes there's

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,079
reduced size and shape of the trichomes

130
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,459
compared to the healthy to the infected

131
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,918
now keep in mind there's not really

132
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,019
reduction in number of trichomes but

133
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,719
there really is a reduction in the kind

134
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,758
of quality of trichomes and this

135
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,919
directly impacts the compounds that the

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,540
plant of course can produce the infected

137
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,799
trichomes are basically underdeveloped

138
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,879
they kind of look like what would be a

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,939
full balloon they kind of look like

140
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,219
they're just deflated and kind of much

141
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,860
smaller as a result they actually have

142
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,360
less in them so this is another stunting

143
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,100
effect not only of the plant but

144
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,560
something's effect of the trichomes and

145
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,379
that is again reducing overall yields

146
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,180
and then lastly here impacts and variety

147
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,240
by cultivar you know we're looking at

148
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,459
healthy versus you know infected healthy

149
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,439
here hanging to dry and tightly infected

150
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,079
hanging to dry here unfortunately it's

151
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,639
really a matter of how much the plant

152
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:32,159
cannabis are reduced so

153
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,800
keep in mind that the cultivar does have

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,620
an impact on this okay a couple genomes

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,538
listed here plant Heights flower to stem

156
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,360
length fresh flower weight THC content

157
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:44,819
and we can see the changes that do occur

158
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,460
now this isn't an Indica only this is an

159
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,620
assertiva only a lot of rhodalis a

160
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,198
hybrid we're kind of lumping these all

161
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,240
together well there's no yet indication

162
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,759
that Indica sativa or verdelves is more

163
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,519
or less susceptible it's kind of

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,600
genotype or cultivar specific so again

165
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,159
trying to give you just that general

166
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,740
idea of some things to kind of be a

167
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,419
little bit on the lookout for and I've

168
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,460
got other videos on the channel on this

169
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:10,560
because this is becoming more recognized

170
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,198
and that's a good thing some to be

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,259
identified and then develop a plan to

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,460
kind of remove this as the hopeful the

173
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,460
long-term goal
