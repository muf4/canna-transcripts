1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,299
okay here we're gonna look at water and

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,048
carbon dioxide during the vegetative

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,699
growth phase of cannabis so first off

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,169
irrigation keep in mind that plants will

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,268
be growing drastically during this phase

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,280
so irrigation may need to be changed to

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,679
meet demands this can mean changing the

8
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,500
frequency the amount of times that you

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,640
water those plants in a day and/or the

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,289
duration the

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
length of time that you give those

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,800
plants water keep in mind this is gonna

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,570
change as the plants grow as they get

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,160
bigger there's gonna be a greater demand

15
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,349
for water so whether you meet that with

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,600
increased frequency or duration may

17
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,530
depend on your particular operations

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,000
constraints or setup now that's it's a

19
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,350
water delivery there's hand watering

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,179
which is not advised a long-term

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,489
solution but it's very labor intensive

22
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,859
can great when they're small can be used

23
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,589
other kind of spot add some plants maybe

24
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,149
on the edge our plant near fan is

25
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,649
getting a little bit more breeze on it

26
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,948
which shouldn't be implemented for the

27
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,299
entire grow facility flood and drain is

28
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,128
possible if you can implement a large

29
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,589
tray system this is a four by two tray

30
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,570
here there's a drip emitter system we

31
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,890
see here on a large scale this is not

32
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,510
the only way it needs to look these can

33
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,269
be very versatile and can be changing

34
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,359
conditions as the plants grow or as they

35
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,269
switch to different rooms co2 is impact

36
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,829
on the veg phase if co2 diffusing co2

37
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,959
it's recommended basically from

38
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,759
emergence through the end of flowering

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,489
phase so Basin through the entire growth

40
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,079
phase of the plant however it can be

41
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,908
most beneficial during the vegetative

42
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,920
phase to help increase biomass of the

43
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,509
plant to try to get a bigger plant a

44
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,519
quicker plant to fill an area adding co2

45
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,459
if you have not added co2 before and

46
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,709
have set plan for your plants in the

47
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,959
sense of kind of I know I see them on

48
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,938
this day I transfer them here I flip

49
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,438
them then you will most likely need to

50
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,629
make adjustments to that original plan

51
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,339
that you may have odds are the plants

52
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,859
are going to grow quicker in larger so

53
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,329
this may offset initial plans that you

54
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,310
have if you're looking at historical

55
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,169
data depending on the size of your gross

56
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,060
base may require either more space

57
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,978
because your plants become bigger so you

58
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,629
may need to accommodate for the space or

59
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,759
reduce time to flower which can be

60
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,530
advantageous if you're on a limited

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
space and want to maintain the same

62
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,340
plant numbers so plants will fill the

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,800
areas faster resulting in shorter

64
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,580
duration to flowers again that

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,930
advantageous for some growers as well

66
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,219
communicate specifics aiming for levels

67
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,760
of seven hundred to a thousand is

68
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,830
advised I suggest using 1200 parts per

69
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,019
million ask them maximum simply because

70
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,870
going beyond this level will not likely

71
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,090
result in any improvement in yields we

72
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,950
could see this chart here going from

73
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,710
zero to a thousand we kind of see it

74
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:39,810
certainly taper off here even my natural

75
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,969
levels are right around 400 so you can

76
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,530
see going up to about a thousand here we

77
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,389
start to level off we are getting a

78
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,479
increase in the photosynthetic process

79
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:50,789
but going again much little above 1200

80
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,560
not really going to give you that much

81
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,560
greater yield and a lot more cost
