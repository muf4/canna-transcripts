1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,910
okay here okay basic classification of

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,589
bones within our skeletal system no

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,320
there's many different types of bones

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,900
many different types of functions some

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,210
are very easily named like flat bone and

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,618
short run and long run some of a very

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,960
irregular shape and I get the term

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,629
irregular bone but each is able to

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,868
perform a unique function as part of our

10
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,698
entire skeletal system so again it's the

11
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,428
shape is how we're going to classify

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,960
them and that shape will relate to where

13
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,449
they're located in the body and the

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,570
function that they perform within that

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,890
particular location so classification of

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,210
bones I'll start with the long bones are

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,009
typically longer than they are wide and

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,558
that's something that the name long

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,780
bones highlight in red here now slowly

20
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,419
rotating skeleton allows you identify

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,939
some of the regions you can find these

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,939
long bones they have a shaft with heads

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,670
at both ends now the heads at both ends

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,608
might be different but it is a head

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,640
region at both ends they contain mostly

26
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,219
compact bone in examples to be the femur

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,460
in the humerus keep in mind the humerus

28
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:12,209
is located in the upper arm here will be

29
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,798
the humerus here and corresponding and

30
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:17,219
very similar looking in the general

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,320
sense down here would be where the femur

32
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,048
would be located so remember our humerus

33
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,209
up here and femur down here and we see a

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,610
lot of similarities between these two

35
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:29,158
long bones the head regions though are

36
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,049
different in between the two and it has

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,150
to result with the joints that each

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,409
attaches to so we're going to be

39
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,509
identifying some of the bones in our

40
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,820
body should be very familiar the humerus

41
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,969
and where the femur is located despite

42
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:45,000
them looking very similar so structural

43
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:48,719
long bones they consist of a diathesis

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,180
and in epithets asst the diathesis is a

45
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,789
tubular shaft that forms the axis of the

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,850
long bones we see that here to Ephesus

47
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,860
the long portion of the long bones it's

48
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,319
composed of compact bone surrounds us

49
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,200
medullary cavity and yellow bone marrow

50
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,188
that is contained within this cavity

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,469
unless we're talking about a very very

52
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,689
young individual physically an infant

53
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:12,180
this medullary cavity would be composed

54
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,829
of mostly red bone marrow but keep in

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,080
mind as we age that red

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,010
because replaced with yellow bone marrow

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,390
which is mostly fat the this is the

58
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:26,099
epiphysis expands ends of the long bone

59
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,979
that's referring to the basically the

60
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,319
head regions it's also exterior is

61
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,359
composed of that compact bone in the

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,400
interior which is majorities that spongy

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,640
bone as you see here reason why it's

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,500
spongy bone it's covered with hyaline

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:46,949
cartilage and this line here is where

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,110
the different regions meet essentially

67
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,239
something called up this middle region

68
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,310
not going to get too much into that the

69
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,280
key part is to understand that the

70
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,699
yellow bone marrow we see indicated here

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,370
is typically found in the diaphysis

72
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:04,619
region the Epistle line is the

73
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,750
separation between the toe the reason

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,340
why there's mostly spongy bone here

75
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,680
is simply because this is what's

76
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,129
allowing for that red bone marrow to be

77
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,689
housed and protected now on the blooms

78
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,609
they also have long votes now we have

79
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,560
our short bones you can see whether

80
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,180
where they're located and highlighted on

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,610
our slowly rotating skeleton up here

82
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,860
generally they're cube-shaped kind of

83
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,230
cube like we'll say and they contain

84
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,260
mostly spongy bone they're found in the

85
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:34,979
carpals and tarsals so carpals are in

86
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,469
our hand see here and tarsals are

87
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:40,349
located in the foot region also the

88
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:45,090
patella or kneecap is classified as a

89
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:48,030
short bone flat bones are thin and

90
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,989
flattened usually curved it helps give

91
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,879
them some strength

92
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,250
there's thin layers have compact bone

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,400
around a layer of spongy bone our skull

94
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,919
our ribs or sternum as though our hips

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,280
are also considered or fallen under the

96
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,569
classification of flat bones again the

97
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,129
reason why they tend to be a little bit

98
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:09,780
curved is that which gives them a little

99
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:12,419
bit more structural integrity lastly our

100
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,319
regular bones these having the regular

101
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,509
shape that's how they get their name

102
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,279
they really don't fit into any other

103
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:20,129
bone classification categories they're

104
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,589
kind of the odd ones of the group here

105
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:25,079
and the vertebral column would be a

106
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,489
prime example of that and that long

107
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,659
bones are not short bones they're

108
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,269
irregular

109
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,720
shaped it's more than just a verbal

110
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:36,419
column some portions of the hip also

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,360
some also of the head region can be

112
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,009
classified as irregular bones hopefully

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,780
this gives you just that basic overview

114
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:47,240
of some of the classifications of bones

115
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,239
by their individual and unique shapes
