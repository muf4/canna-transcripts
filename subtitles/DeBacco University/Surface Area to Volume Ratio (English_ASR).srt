1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:06,689
when discussing cells surface area to

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,359
volume ratio is a very important concept

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,349
to get an understanding of so first

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,048
looking at surface area and volume

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,528
length is simply just a distance between

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,778
two points area is a squared term

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:22,589
typically length times width and our

8
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:25,649
volume here is a cubic term length times

9
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,339
width times height or could be depth

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:31,288
different shapes will give you different

11
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:34,019
basically surface areas and volumes

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,630
depending on their size and you can see

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,899
here the the comparison of area to

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,640
volume the area to volume and how these

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,230
different shapes create these different

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,780
ratios and that's we're going to look at

17
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,549
a little bit here so first off why are

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,770
cells so small since a basic question

19
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,218
how come we're not just one big cell

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,530
I'll put a link to both of these YouTube

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,230
videos this first one here is a great

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,739
job of explaining certain things and it

23
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:04,948
goes over the agar cube experiment which

24
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:07,349
has to do with the diffusion of certain

25
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:10,978
components in different size cubes or

26
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:14,429
blocks here so for soft cell size cell

27
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,650
sizes range from 1 millimeter down to 1

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,189
micrometer either way they're still very

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,618
small

30
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,929
the reason why this is it cells need a

31
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,959
large surface area of a membrane to

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,900
adequately exchange materials so what we

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,449
see here is in our small intestine we

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,118
have these villi these kind of finger

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,859
like structures you can kind of see and

36
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,290
what that allows is a lot of surface

37
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,129
area this is important because this

38
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,210
helps and aids in the ability for

39
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:45,089
nutrients to be able to diffuse across

40
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,129
the membrane so I have the picture up

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,020
here of a paper it's just flat and a

42
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,438
paper that becomes more and more folded

43
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,938
we're increasing the surface area here

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,099
allowing for easier to exchange

45
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,339
materials so you could think I've just

46
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,589
had a solid area very limited area you

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,990
can have contact with you take that same

48
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,149
area and I put all my fingers up now now

49
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,609
we have all these areas here and that

50
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,259
allows for a lot more surface area this

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,629
diffusion process reason why this is

52
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,939
important is our cells in this case red

53
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,979
blood cells example here

54
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,409
taking in oxygen releasing carbon

55
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:19,609
dioxide diffusion is spontaneous I mean

56
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,680
there's no energy investment that's

57
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,270
required for the net movement of

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,939
particles down a concentration gradient

59
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,610
so just as we put a drop of food dye

60
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,889
here it diffuses throughout all the

61
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,810
water simply using the molecular motion

62
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:35,750
of the water molecules here it diffuses

63
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,969
or moves across the food dye same thing

64
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,430
here in our cells with diffusion oxygens

65
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:42,740
freely had to come in ch is freely able

66
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,750
to leave there's no energy required very

67
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,550
important for cells so if they have this

68
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,349
great surface area to volume ratio this

69
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,750
can occur spontaneously no energy

70
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,219
required which means that life can

71
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,939
continue because there's not a lot of

72
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:57,500
demand for energy for this purpose we

73
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,689
call this a surface area to volume ratio

74
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,460
and this is because of this require

75
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:03,949
cells to be small so again here's our

76
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,469
small intestine and we see these kind of

77
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:08,629
finger like projections now these are

78
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:11,930
all cells all lining these entire of

79
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:14,329
peaks and valleys but we see zoomed in

80
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,909
here of our villi which we have micro

81
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,040
villi so we have increased surface area

82
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:22,280
even with on the cells and this is

83
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,919
really what helps us absorb our food

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,259
much more efficiently large cells

85
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,139
surface area relative defying ratio

86
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,549
decreases volume of the living cytoplasm

87
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,439
that's the inner portion of the cells

88
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,060
which demands nutrients and produces

89
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,859
waste and kind of exchange those two

90
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,439
cells specialize in absorption

91
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,750
unutilized membrane modifications such

92
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,979
as micro villi example here to greatly

93
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,500
increase the surface area to volume

94
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:47,988
ratio the picture the feather here

95
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,599
because the feather is very high surface

96
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,670
area to volume ratio a lot of fine fine

97
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,799
hairs here it's kind of the same concept

98
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:58,849
trying to get to understand here on our

99
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,320
micro villi so example here at the same

100
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,569
surface area but we're changing the

101
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,289
volume as we take that paper and we're

102
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:08,000
folding it we're increasing the volume

103
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:08,859
so we're changing that ratio of surface

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,750
area to volume

105
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,300
starting off our surface area if the

106
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,160
beginning and end is actually the same

107
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,739
but our volume is changing dramatically

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,340
and this is what's affecting the ability

109
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:24,349
for cells to exchange nutrients so

110
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:27,659
what's this look like mathematically so

111
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,660
I have three cubes here one

112
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,370
Huber's just a solid block this one we

113
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,490
could see our individual cubes here

114
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,439
there's basically eight of them here we

115
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,569
have many more I want you to think about

116
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,259
each of these individual cubes is having

117
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,329
their own independent kind of surface

118
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,500
air in volume yes they're all stacked up

119
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:48,870
together here but thinking is

120
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,610
independent so looking at comparison all

121
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,899
three of these initially if we take the

122
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,150
volume which is simply the height times

123
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,250
the width times the length number of

124
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,459
cubes we come with the same number so

125
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,449
all three of these are the same volume

126
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,549
what you're noticing is different here

127
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:05,279
is those the surface area this is one

128
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,410
big block as a result as a relatively

129
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,959
small surface area in this case 96

130
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,870
centimeters cubed this one has eight two

131
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,239
centimeter cubes and this is 192

132
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,850
centimeters squared as soon as the mini

133
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,100
blocks was actually 64 pick animal here

134
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,970
and they're only 1 centimeter cubes this

135
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,510
has a surface area total surface area of

136
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:30,120
363 hundred 84 centimeters squared when

137
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,469
we do the ratio out which is surface

138
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,899
area over volume we're noticing our

139
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,990
surface area divided by our volume we

140
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,219
can move the one point five to one ratio

141
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,740
here it's a three to one ratio in here

142
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,750
it's a six to one ratio the higher the

143
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,689
number here six to one be the highest

144
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,209
the greatest chance that diffusion can

145
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,509
occur throughout the entire cell here

146
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:56,430
our surface area of diffusion I'm going

147
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:58,649
to be very limited looking at the entire

148
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,009
volume of the cell here to be much more

149
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:03,779
extensive this is why cells are small to

150
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,310
put this in perspective of a high

151
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,679
surface area to volume ratio nothing

152
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,290
biologically elephant's ears or in this

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,199
case the rabbits ears used for cooling

154
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,560
high surface area ratio meaning heats

155
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,409
very easy to exchange you may know the

156
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,100
heat sink curve at air foils here on

157
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,930
computers or in certain mechanics this

158
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,510
is increasing the surface area to allow

159
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,300
heat to escape rady or in a car does the

160
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,849
same thing all of these four examples

161
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,300
have a very high surface area to volume

162
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,220
ratio in contrast to that times they

163
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,530
have a very low surface area to volume

164
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:45,020
ratio used for heat retention well

165
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,599
pretty large structure not a lot of

166
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,459
folds very smooth and limiting the

167
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,939
amount of contact they have polar bears

168
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:55,609
kneeling in cold environment in penguins

169
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:59,449
all huddling together here reducing the

170
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:02,270
total amount of exposed surface area to

171
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,269
kind of keep that key in and more

172
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:07,359
efficiently last days a couple links

173
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:10,069
here again looking at some other

174
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,170
available resources for you it all comes

175
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,759
back to cells being small to allow them

176
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,860
to be able to fuse nutrients and that

177
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,370
occurs through a very high surface area

178
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,370
to volume ratio
