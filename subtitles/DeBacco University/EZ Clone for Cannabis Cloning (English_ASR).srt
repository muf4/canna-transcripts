00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,440
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,758
here i want to go over easy clone for

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,760
the cannabis cloning process

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,280
setting up the physical system if you

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,960
want to know how to actually take the

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,199
clones i have other videos

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
on that but let's go over the setup of

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,629
the easyclone system

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:25,598
for cannabis cloning

10
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:26,719
[Music]

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,399
all right let's make sure all the

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,358
mechanics will be working so when you

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,518
take your clones

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
they'll be going into a good environment

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,558
well first off we want to be

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,719
mindful that the reason why i chose the

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,159
easy clone is it's the industry standard

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,359
there's many options but this is

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,639
considered just to be one of the

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,399
standards and hopefully you'll have

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,119
roots that will look like this or even

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
better

23
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,399
there's many other designs that copy the

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,399
easyclone

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
basic system which is again a sign it's

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
probably pretty effective

27
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,279
it is very efficient in a simple system

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
and that's kind of the reason why

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,558
there's so many copies

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,878
so you don't have to specifically use

31
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,399
this easy clone

32
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,640
actual system that i'm going to show

33
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,600
here a lot of the basics will apply to

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
other systems

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
but i chose that one here just as a

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
representative sample and hopefully you

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,799
find it helpful

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
and increase the odds of success with

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
your own plants

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,960
okay so here we're looking at the easy

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,640
clone system it's a very efficient

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,079
aeroponic cloner

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,478
what we're looking at here at the very

44
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,039
top is all the nice little foam discs

45
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,959
here

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,960
these will be utilized to hold the

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,959
plants so when we're looking at taking

48
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,759
our clones and harvesting our clones if

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,078
they were this

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,399
pen for example we would simply go

51
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,279
through take a clone about that long

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,280
and then insert it into the foam disk

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
that then allows this to be held

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,478
and that will simply go into the area

55
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,478
here we'll have our little clones here

56
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,159
now occurs on the underside well on the

57
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,560
underside this is where

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,840
all of the water pump is and all the

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,879
water will be

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,840
so on the inside here we'll notice

61
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,519
we have this water pump now this water

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,319
pump simply takes in water

63
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,439
and then sprays it out of all of these

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,878
little jets here

65
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,878
what does that create well that creates

66
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,280
a very high humidity heavy

67
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,919
mist environment right here why is that

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
important

69
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,439
well if we look at kind of the underside

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,159
here you can see where i still have the

71
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,159
pen

72
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,840
this is where our roots are going to be

73
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,439
initially formed want to keep that area

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,439
dark which we can see here

75
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,959
and also high moisture to reduce the

76
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,639
stress on the plants

77
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,479
so our plants will all be kind of here

78
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,639
or clones with no roots

79
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,479
initially this will then create a very

80
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,119
favorable environment for them

81
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,919
to root and this simple water pump just

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200
constantly runs on it 24 hours a day

83
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,518
and that will just kind of keep that

84
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,479
area well misted so that offers a great

85
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,080
advantage

86
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,399
to be able to kind of offer a

87
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
favorable area for that rooting to occur

88
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,319
you also notice

89
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,399
on the tank here there is a

90
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,839
on the underside here there is an area

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
to easily drain it

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,239
that is great to easily drain it when

93
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,598
you want to keep in mind that if you

94
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,360
are initially filling this you want to

95
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,959
make sure that's closed and set

96
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
and that no water is going to drain out

97
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,598
when you go through and fill it

98
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,000
so you can see fairly easy simple system

99
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,158
this is the official easy clone

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,039
name brand if you will there's many

101
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,000
different

102
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,239
kind of copycats there are kind of

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,318
different types of competitors out there

104
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,319
this is kind of where it all originated

105
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:30,958
and this really offers a nice very

106
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,119
efficient

107
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,000
system and let's see setting it up in a

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
small grow tent

109
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,439
so here we're looking at the 2x2 grotin

110
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
that's going to

111
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,759
house our 64 easy clown what we're

112
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,039
noticing right here

113
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,878
is a deluxe 315 watt cmh

114
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,158
ceramic metal halide light that's going

115
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,560
to provide the even

116
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,158
light source here for all of the plants

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,239
i've got a couple systems off

118
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,679
right now we'll see those kind of

119
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,400
implemented as they go through and turn

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
them all

121
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
get the ball working together but right

122
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,400
now i've got the light testing that out

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,080
and down here is ultimately where the

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
easy clone is going to go

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
keep in mind just because they're clones

126
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,680
air circulation is still important and

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,358
here we're in an office so we also want

128
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,239
to make sure that we have a carbon

129
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,039
filter

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,679
to reduce any potential odors also going

131
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,560
to set up

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
the water monitoring system to our easy

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
clone but let's go ahead and just simply

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,759
install the basic structure of the easy

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
clone so kind of getting it right off

136
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,680
the

137
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,319
main desk table there simply going to go

138
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
through and

139
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,918
it's a tight fit but it does just fit

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
perfectly right there so you can see

141
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,918
again two by two

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,639
really maximizing the overall space that

143
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,000
we have

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
now i want to go through make sure we're

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,959
filling it full of water and i'll show

146
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:58,560
you that process

147
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,478
so one quick note when we're setting

148
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,560
this up you want to make sure

149
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,240
if you look very closely at the easy

150
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,079
clone here

151
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
you'll notice that there's a series of

152
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,279
numbers

153
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,479
that work their way from one

154
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,519
all the way to the number eight on this

155
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,839
side

156
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,680
and then there's a series of letters as

157
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,519
well h

158
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
through a that's up there and numbers

159
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,839
replicate up there

160
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,839
the numbers replicate up there and the

161
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,839
letters replicate coming down here

162
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,279
that's just important for identification

163
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,000
which you should be keeping track of

164
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,638
anyway but knowing what clone

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,759
what strain what variety is in what area

166
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,600
is important

167
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
so again it's just helpful if you start

168
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,240
off by organizing it in such a way

169
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,959
and orienting it so that the entering

170
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
point

171
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,799
matches up with everything now if you

172
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
look ahead here as i'm getting

173
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,918
everything together

174
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,400
you'll notice i have the monitor

175
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,399
in there and again this is just with

176
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,918
regular tap water so i've gone through

177
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,758
and just taken

178
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:06,799
right out of the water faucet

179
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,840
with our blue labs

180
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,720
monitor here you can see reading 130

181
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,599
parts per million 74 degrees fahrenheit

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,120
and a ph

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,240
of 7.0 to 7.1 i'm going to go through

184
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
and add the

185
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,439
necessarily the necessary nutrient

186
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,639
solution

187
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,560
and let's see where this ends up before

188
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,560
we start modifying the ph at all

189
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,520
so it's looking getting our nutrient

190
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,439
solution all ready for our clones

191
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,198
i choose to use a clonex clone solution

192
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,879
and it recommends about 5 to 10

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,478
milliliters per liter

194
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,240
so use that as a general starting point

195
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,120
always start on the low end and start

196
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
adding

197
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,478
what i kind of do is start at the low

198
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,399
end and i use my

199
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,560
blue labs monitor here to be able to

200
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,079
dial everything in and make sure

201
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,399
the solution that the plants will be

202
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,199
exposed to is within the tolerances that

203
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,598
i want

204
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
so again this is a great kind of initial

205
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,240
solution to start with

206
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,519
works great with the easy clone and can

207
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
kind of go right through and

208
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,159
just takes a little time to get

209
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
everything all adjusted

210
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,560
and when we're adding our nutrient

211
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,959
solution it's very important to keep in

212
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,598
mind

213
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,959
of where your monitors are so as an

214
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,560
extreme case here

215
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,799
where i poured the nutrient solution

216
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,519
happens to be exactly where the monitors

217
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,879
were

218
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,799
so you could see right now growers might

219
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,399
be a little bit of in a panic

220
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,079
with a high concentration of parts per

221
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,279
million a very low ph

222
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,879
but keep in mind you want to let that

223
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,399
pump run you want to give it a couple

224
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,639
times before you start making

225
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,318
quick adjustments let it settle out add

226
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,840
a little bit more add a little bit more

227
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,840
until you get it dialed in

228
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,758
now again as another note you want to be

229
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,120
mindful that while everything looks like

230
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,319
it's nice and sealed here

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,399
when you lift these out you might be

232
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
getting some mist that sprays out

233
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,000
so that's why it's important always to

234
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,918
start or have these on hand

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
to maintain a nice sealed environment

236
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,000
here because that pump is actively going

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,439
and it's doing exactly what we want it

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,879
to do

239
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,560
doing exactly what it wanted to do in

240
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,479
the sense that is spraying water some a

241
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
little bit more violently than others

242
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,519
but down as i look down in there in that

243
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
environment that's exactly what we want

244
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,918
to see you want to see that nice

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,439
heavy heavy mist so there might be some

246
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,279
dead spots here and there

247
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,959
but for the most part the high humidity

248
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,478
that this does create is

249
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,959
beneficial for rooting just remember

250
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,120
you want all of your nutrients dialed in

251
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,718
and you also want to be mindful

252
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,479
of maximizing the amount of water

253
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,240
and maximizing the amount of light

254
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
keeping air circulation keeping all the

255
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
conditions you want consistent

256
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
again we're watching our nutrients kind

257
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
of come up and get a little bit more

258
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,319
dialed in there we're adding a couple a

259
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
little bit more being incremental not

260
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
making sure we spike anything too much

261
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
pump seems to be working great just be

262
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,639
mindful that you might want to be

263
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,839
careful of some areas you can spray a

264
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,439
lot of water

265
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,200
um so you want to make sure those are

266
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,080
all nicely sealed up before you get to

267
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,759
your clones

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,200
and that will just help maintain the

269
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,240
water in the environment and efficient

270
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,160
use of that water

271
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,399
because it's constantly recirculating in

272
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,399
there

273
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,199
and as part of these clone we get

274
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,480
everything dialed in what am i shooting

275
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,680
for

276
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,039
well i think a parts milling around 7 20

277
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,719
730

278
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,719
temperature around 74 and ph around 6.2

279
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
these are good initial targets to have

280
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,240
there good way that will definitely

281
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,159
produce some quality clones

282
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
so again once everything is dialed in

283
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,439
make sure everything's running well i

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,399
got the fans running

285
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,880
the carbon filter set to go and i've got

286
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,240
all

287
00:09:46,879 --> 00:10:05,838
of the area here all ready

288
00:09:50,240 --> 00:10:05,839
for clones
