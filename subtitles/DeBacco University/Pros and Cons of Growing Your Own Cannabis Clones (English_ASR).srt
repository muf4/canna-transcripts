00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
so this is intended to be a short

tobacco university video

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,918
for those considering or looking for the

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,120
pros and cons of growing your own

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,959
cannabis clones

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,718
where some of the advantages were some

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,000
of the disadvantages stay tuned and

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,919
you'll learn about them here

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920
in this video

10
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:24,719
[Music]

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,320
all right let's get into the video here

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,679
so first off growing on campus clones

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,960
what's the advantage why would you want

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,879
to consider this

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
well you allows you as a grower to know

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,399
the source it allows you

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
to grow to also control the timing of

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,558
when those clones will be ready

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,718
to grow into the next stage of plants

20
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,878
they can also be known in a consistent

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,200
supply you don't have to rely on anyone

22
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,878
else so these are a lot of the kind of

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
pros or advantages here that growers

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,119
seek and why they would consider

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,479
growing their own clones however with

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,919
any decision or any

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,000
decision you're looking at there's not

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,840
always all just positives

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,840
some of the disadvantages if you do

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,840
decide to grow your own clones is that

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,039
the time and resources required or

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,439
needed to be devoted

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,280
to production of those clones sometimes

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,879
it's easier just to buy the clones

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
instead of going through this process of

36
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,519
having all these materials and timing

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,799
all set

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,079
the cost of setting up that clone

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
production has to be weighed to

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,759
determine whether or not

41
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,639
that is going to net a positive yield in

42
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,879
the end

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,640
and also not only the cost you also have

44
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,438
to consider the space and environments

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,759
required

46
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,279
to be able to ensure you have the proper

47
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,799
cloning environment so it's not a waste

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
of time so you actually

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
have good odds of producing quality

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
clones

51
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
so again if you're thinking about

52
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,078
growing your own clones hopefully this

53
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,000
has provided you with some of the

54
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,239
disadvantages some of the advantages

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,239
and has given you some background so you

56
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,158
can make an educated decision

57
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,359
on what you want to implement for your

58
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,359
growing area
