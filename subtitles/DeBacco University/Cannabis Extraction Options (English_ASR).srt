00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,160
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,879
going to go over canvas extraction

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,599
options

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,480
how we can turn this into this and what

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,399
process

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,400
we may go through or some advantages and

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,199
disadvantages some of the processes

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,240
to go through and turn canvas buds into

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,239
a final extract

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,839
[Music]

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,599
all right i'm going to go over some

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,198
cannabis extraction options give you

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,039
some of the advantages and disadvantages

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,200
of each if there's one you want to learn

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
more about search this channel here on

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,559
tobacco university and you'll find more

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,439
detailed versions

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,959
of that specific extraction method so

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,960
first off why would we want to extract

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
in the first place so extraction allows

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
for a purified product

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,199
from the cannabis plant that is showing

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,760
increased popularity among consumers

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,719
extracts also offer more consistent

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,198
dosing

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,800
than just using the dry flour there are

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,000
different methods of extraction each

28
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,718
with its own advantages and

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
disadvantages that we provided here

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,558
so first off just a quick advantage

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,040
disadvantage of water-based extraction

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,079
well the advantages of the elimination

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,799
of additional

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,079
sample cleanup ease of automation and a

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
cheap solvent because it's basically

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,840
using water

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
however the disadvantages are the long

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,000
residence time of extracts

39
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,079
it has increased risk of phytochemical

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,319
degradation as well

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,759
so if water extracts not for you then

42
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,758
we've got rosin

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,959
the advantage of rosin it's a near pure

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,879
concentrated

45
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,640
product that's produced relatively

46
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,920
simple and easy process with minimal

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
specialized equipment

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,280
however the downfall is it does for at

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
least high pressure rosin

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
presses can be extremely dangerous if

51
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,759
misused and it's very easy to burn the

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,280
extract

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,719
if not it's properly pressed so there

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,799
are some stepwise protocols to follow

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,158
there's also the distillation method of

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
extraction and this

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,359
is an extremely pure product when

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,078
compared to other extraction

59
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,200
methods complete control over terpenes

60
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,599
and flavonoids

61
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,799
easily automated and can really allow

62
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,879
for very specific

63
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,159
components to be extracted and put into

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,000
separate containers

65
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,000
however as we can see here this can be a

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,919
very costly and long process

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,639
with multiple steps sometimes it can

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,000
take days to pass one liter of crude oil

69
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,238
through the machine

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,759
the distillation process strips the

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,759
cannabis of all compounds

72
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,598
except for the desired compound which

73
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,759
can have dramatic effect on the terpenes

74
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,839
when adding them back into the mixture

75
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,439
so again that's one of the disadvantages

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
so these are the methods for you

77
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,719
you might want to consider alcohol or

78
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
ethanol specific extraction

79
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,560
this is a very cost effective for large

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
amounts alcohol extraction can pull a

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,479
broader range of compounds from the

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,318
plant

83
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,759
than other extraction methods there's no

84
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,159
risk of leaving toxic

85
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,199
residual chemicals in the final chemist

86
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,120
extract

87
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,719
however the disadvantages are that

88
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
ethanol has a much higher boiling point

89
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,878
than other solvents which could lead to

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,959
a longer process post-processing

91
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
is extensive several refinements must be

92
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
made to the extract before it's consumer

93
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,199
ready

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
and it can be extremely genius in a

95
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,679
significant fire hazard if being used

96
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,519
indoors

97
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
ethanol alcohol in general highly

98
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
flammable

99
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,719
then you get to carbon dioxide

100
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,519
extraction so this is a

101
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,318
less valuable material is wasted it's a

102
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
specific compounds with adjustments can

103
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,439
to heat pressure and run time can be

104
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,039
made

105
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,878
and there's no residual solvent in the

106
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,519
final product through the evaporation

107
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,878
of the carbon dioxide the disadvantages

108
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,560
it's much higher initial

109
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,000
startup cost when compared to the other

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,598
extraction methods

111
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
even once purchased the equipment

112
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,399
requires proper training and safety

113
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,319
procedures to be understood

114
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,439
and followed this is when you want to

115
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,518
use caution if you're going to be

116
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,878
utilizing this extraction method

117
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,879
the last one mentioned here is going to

118
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,639
be hydrocarbon extraction

119
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:41,840
this offers a wide range of extract

120
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,199
types and can be achieved through

121
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,039
hydrocarbon extraction

122
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,199
can be done with trim and flower

123
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,120
relative low equipment and run costs

124
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,280
however the downfall is extremely

125
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
dangerous butane propane highly

126
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,080
flammable and

127
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,759
extreme caution must be used when

128
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
extracting with hydrocarbons

129
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,798
unwanted compounds can make it tough for

130
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
the extraction process and would need a

131
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,920
later refinement

132
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,039
so again if each or any one of these

133
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,759
extraction methods you want to learn

134
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,679
more about

135
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,039
search the channel and hopefully you can

136
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,040
find some more detail

137
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,039
as you continue your education
