00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,919
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
looking at hybrid cannabis and

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,839
explaining some

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,839
of the nuances associated with it this

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,119
can be a little difficult because

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,960
many of the cannabis is actually

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,198
becoming a hybrid because growers are

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,760
looking at blending different traits

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,199
so masby's blended is kind of this cat

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,279
and bird here but we're getting this

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,679
kind of blending of indica sativas and

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,800
even

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,399
rudalus so just the origin of hybrids

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,000
just in general the goals that try to

15
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,479
obtain the best of both worlds

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,799
in one plant there's often there's a

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,398
popular demand to combine the autoflower

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,238
plant characteristics with another

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,640
desired cannabinoid and or

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,238
terpene profile this is why growers are

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
bringing that rudalus with some of the

22
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,599
indicas or sativas

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
whose growers are really looking for the

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,719
ease of plant maintenance with also a

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
high quality

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,239
end product so it's that kind of nice

27
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,558
kind of mixing of that blue

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,159
and that yellow to get that green that

29
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,839
kind of merger of two

30
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,839
to get the best of both worlds and to

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,520
create something new as well

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,359
so the hybrid plant morphology how does

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
how do these plants in general look

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,920
well hybrids can be very variable so you

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,199
want to make sure you're doing your

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680
research

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
is highly advised so that you know what

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
you're getting

39
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,679
into you want to start by getting an

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
idea of is

41
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
indica or sativa dominant in morphology

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,560
it's going to be really tall

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,719
or it's going to have a tendency to be

44
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
shorter and squattier this will give you

45
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,798
that general classification

46
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,079
oftentimes the goal by breeders is to

47
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
take a standard strain

48
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,840
and to breed it in the autoflower into

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
it but keep in mind that other

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,040
morphological features need to be taken

51
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,359
into consideration

52
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
more than just it becoming photoperiod

53
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,280
independent

54
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,000
now popular cultivation locations again

55
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
it can be very

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,118
diverse because with the autoflower

57
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,000
characteristics

58
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,599
this is a morphology that fits in many

59
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
different growing conditions both

60
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,199
indoors and outdoors

61
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
with an improved cannabinoid or terpene

62
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
content this makes it very easy

63
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,200
for selection for a wide varieties of

64
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,320
growers however breeders need to

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,118
continue in this area and make

66
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,879
improvements

67
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,959
because while we have the rootales kind

68
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
of gene and autoflower characteristics

69
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,839
and we've got our

70
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,920
dominant indica sativas with

71
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,039
cannabinoids the merger of the two

72
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
they're still working on

73
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,199
ensuring you get the best of both worlds

74
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,400
right now these hybrids might favor one

75
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,159
versus another

76
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
so there is still lots of room for

77
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,439
improvement some people have tried some

78
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
of the early hybrids

79
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,598
and weren't really thrilled with them

80
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
but there's continual improvements

81
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,878
for this particular type of cultivation

82
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,598
of cannabis now it's hard to kind of

83
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,679
pinpoint any one or a couple

84
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,199
varieties but we can see here there's

85
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,319
many different ones that fall into the

86
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,518
classification of

87
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,119
hybrids i just listed a few here because

88
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
remember a lot of growers are breeding

89
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,120
in different types indica sativas

90
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,560
the whole goal is to get the best of

91
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
both worlds all

92
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,878
in one plant with an established

93
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,318
cultivar established strain here

94
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,239
to help uh create this ability

95
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,399
for growers to produce a high quality

96
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
product but still meet the demands of

97
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879
their particular growing conditions

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,878
quite well
