1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
interested in learning more about hps or

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
high pressure sodium lighting

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,558
with regards to cannabis production

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,080
you've come to the right place here at

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,678
debaco university where i'll be

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,920
explaining some of the options

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
with hps lighting

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,879
so let's get some of the options and

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,358
details with hbs lighting

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,640
for cannabis production so first off

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,079
we're talking about hps

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,000
lights is a sodium vapor lamp that is a

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,280
gas discharge lamp that uses sodium in

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,759
excited state to produce

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,160
light a characteristic wavelength near

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,439
589 nanometers which has that yellow

17
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,679
orange appearance

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,359
they are high pressure sodium or hps

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,558
bulbs belong to the high

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,079
intensity discharge hid lamp family

21
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,238
which means that they produce light in

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,320
excited gases and vaporizing metals

23
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,919
with electrical current to sufficiently

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,399
excite them to produce

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,000
the light just as a note that low

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,878
pressure sodium lamps are commonly seen

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
as street lighting

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,079
they are not the same as these high

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,599
pressure sodium lights

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,118
high pressure sodium lights are commonly

31
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,559
used as plant and grow lights

32
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,400
because of the high output that they

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,118
have and ability to grow plants

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,719
when we don't have the sun now the

35
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,840
structure of a high pressure sodium

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,200
lamp or the bulb here as we can see

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,280
that there is a lot of internal

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,560
structures now they can be purchased in

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
250 400

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,719
600 or 1000 watt setups these are all

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
single ended they can also be in

42
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,560
double ended particularly 1000 watts so

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,560
realize that there's a lot in here

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,478
there's a vacuum there's a lot of metal

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,600
so when you're purchasing these lamps be

46
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,359
sure you inspect them

47
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,640
to make sure that nothing is broken

48
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,438
internally in the light

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,719
so it's safe and it will actually work

50
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,519
now the distance between the high

51
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,519
pressure sodium

52
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,039
and the plants hyperstem cellulites do

53
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,560
generate quite a bit of heat so when

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
using higher wattages

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
the distance between the light and the

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,320
plants should be overly overall

57
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,599
increased typical distances for high

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,279
pressure sodium grow lights can be

59
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,078
mounted anywhere between 6

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,759
and 34 inches away 6 inches is very

61
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,559
close and if you have a dimmable one

62
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,319
or a low wattage output one maybe six

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,159
inches but for the most part

64
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,318
it's better to start further away than

65
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,680
than closer and also when in doubt you

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,039
want to measure the light intensity with

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
a par meter to start

68
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,400
with a greater distance to reduce it if

69
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,000
there's no burn or damage notice if you

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
start too close you'll torch potentially

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
everything

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,479
so starting further away and bringing it

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
closer can be advantageous you also need

74
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,199
to set up a ventilation system because

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,878
these will be generating a fair amount

76
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,598
of heat even if you're only growing with

77
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,439
one light

78
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,119
to be able to cool the environment that

79
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,759
the plants are in

80
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,280
as i mentioned that heat so often when

81
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,039
growing with high pressure sodium lights

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
growers will likely need a way to reduce

83
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,840
the natural heat that this light source

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
produces

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,439
a single commercial reflectors are the

86
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,878
most efficient

87
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,719
this will often result in growers

88
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,318
adjusting their growing environment to

89
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,239
either increase air circulation or

90
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,000
adding a cooling system

91
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
this is also if some growers grow in

92
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,560
colder climates and they're completely

93
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,479
indoors

94
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
they may choose to run these lights at

95
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,679
night why because they're going to

96
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,919
generate heat anyway

97
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
and when it's nighttime on the outside

98
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,000
in the natural environment temperatures

99
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,158
tend to

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,919
cool so it might be a more advantageous

101
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:08,799
time to generate some heat to keep the

102
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,399
plants warm

103
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
and also provide them with light because

104
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,120
if they're an indoor facility they're

105
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,719
not going to know what the natural light

106
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
is anyway

107
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,120
now hbs replacing bulbs and the

108
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,120
reflectors here

109
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
so a lot of growers typically think of

110
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,080
only the bulbs but we also have to keep

111
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,598
in mind the reflectors

112
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
hps grow light should be replaced about

113
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,079
every five thousand to ten thousand

114
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,439
hours of usage

115
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
the light intensity should be checked

116
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,000
with a par meter note that the bulbs and

117
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,159
also

118
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
reflectors degrade over time so for

119
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,199
canvas production where light intensity

120
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
should be maximized

121
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,719
growers will use the 5000 hour mark to

122
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,039
change out their bulbs out

123
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,919
and not run them any longer the

124
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,519
reflectors

125
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,679
you can use a parameter kind of check

126
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,120
that typically every about two years

127
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
keep them clean

128
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,039
and that could be another thing very

129
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,519
easy to replace not that expensive it

130
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,039
can help

131
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,039
increase the intensity of light that

132
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,280
gets down to your plants

133
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,878
so those reflectors commercial

134
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
all-in-one units are preferred like the

135
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,000
one

136
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,159
right next to me over here over build

137
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,080
your own options to maximize production

138
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,719
and eliminate potential chance or inc

139
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
capabilities i also would not recommend

140
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,158
you taking the old

141
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,598
kind of turkey tin here and flipping it

142
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,439
over and using that as a reflector it

143
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,959
may look like it does the same thing

144
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,478
but from a plant standpoint it's not

145
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
going to be nearly as efficient as these

146
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,839
commercial options

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,439
however even with a quality commercial

148
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,959
setup reflectors should be replaced and

149
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,399
growers are advised to purchase

150
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,359
replacements when you're producing your

151
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,959
light initially

152
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,720
to maximize production reflectors should

153
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,519
be checked replaced about every two to

154
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
four years

155
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,959
to maximize your cannabis production

156
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,639
there

157
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,239
now atreus lights for the entire grow

158
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,319
cycle can you use them from seedling

159
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,079
stage to the end flowering stage

160
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,478
well it is possible but usually not

161
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,000
recommended to use hps lighting for the

162
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,680
entire grow cycle

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,918
if this is the case early grow plant

164
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
will might stretch more evident

165
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,560
stretching more evident meaning your

166
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
seedlings might be taller than they

167
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,478
should be

168
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
simply because the amount of red light

169
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,399
is great for photosynthesis but does

170
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,919
induce stretching of the plant to reduce

171
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,000
stretching growers can select a bulb

172
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,359
that produces high blue light as well

173
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
or exposed plants with some natural

174
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,759
sunlight to fill in some of the missing

175
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,759
blue spectrum

176
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,280
to help keep those internet spacing down

177
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,199
a little bit

178
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,959
now high pressure sodium common wattages

179
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
are about 600 and thousand watts of the

180
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,279
common ones

181
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,519
600 watt grow lights are the most

182
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,519
efficient hps grow lamp

183
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,799
these grow lights produce more like

184
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,478
output per watt

185
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,319
used in other wattages and their

186
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,240
suggested coverage areas of five by five

187
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,639
in a bedroom or four by four in a flower

188
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
room

189
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
definitely no more than that for a

190
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,038
thousand watt

191
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,959
they're the most powerful and cover the

192
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,719
largest area six by six for a bedroom

193
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,799
and five by five for a flower room

194
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
so deciding on what wattage will also

195
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,160
determine the type of bulb you use

196
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,560
and the type of area you can cover

197
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,680
now there's also single ended and double

198
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,439
ended bulbs

199
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,879
so over here you can see that there's a

200
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,000
single ended and then below me is the

201
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,600
double double-ended

202
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,439
single-ended bulbs recommend to be used

203
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
with 600 watts in

204
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,560
lower wattages they're easy to replace

205
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,638
and use

206
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,319
considerably considerably more at the

207
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,400
hobby level

208
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
to operate and reduce temperatures so

209
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,478
advise for small grow tent

210
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,918
settings uh compared to your double

211
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,279
ended your double endings are

212
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,198
recommended for a thousand watt bulbs to

213
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,439
ensure maximum light intensity

214
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
and associated with commercial settings

215
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,719
they allow for greater light intensity

216
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,560
and even more even distribution of the

217
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,000
light compared to the single ended

218
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
and they can produce more wavelengths

219
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
outside the par range including infrared

220
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
and uv

221
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
light that's why they're typically

222
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,880
preferred at that commercial

223
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,159
setting again single line is a little

224
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,000
bit easier to change recommend for the

225
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,439
lower wattages commercial setting 1000

226
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,279
watts you should be going with the

227
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,879
double ended because that is pretty much

228
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,439
considered to be kind of the industry

229
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,879
standard

230
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,439
when it comes to high pressure sodium

231
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,439
lights
