00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,240
welcome to another video here on debaco

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,519
university

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
here we're going to be looking at

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,839
snell's law of refraction

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,120
now refraction keep in mind light

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,679
passing through difference in

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,279
mediums can cause bending of light

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,800
that's what kind of makes the spoon look

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,719
like an optical illusion here

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,160
looks like it's broken that's because of

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,919
the bending of the light through those

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,320
different mediums

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
now snell's law of reflect refraction

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,679
well snell's law describes the behavior

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
of light as it travels from one medium

16
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,719
into a different medium and snell's law

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,719
can be written as

18
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,558
n1 which referring to the refractive

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,600
index of substance one

20
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,640
times the sine of angle one equals

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,920
the refractive index n2 of substance two

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,039
times the sine of the angle of angle

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,039
number two

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,120
now both of these angles are measured

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,239
relative to the normal or line drawn

26
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,558
perpendicular

27
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,000
so you can see indicated here to the

28
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,759
surfaces where the two

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,399
mediums will meet now snell's law of

30
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,640
refraction

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
in order to calculate this on the

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,679
refractive index of materials is based

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,478
on the angle

34
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,079
the light hits and bends we can see that

35
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:08,798
depicted here the lights coming in at

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,319
this angle

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
passes through the means and it comes

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,879
out at this angle through the second

39
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,560
medium

40
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,879
here we can see all of the components

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,640
you can see all of them described

42
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,920
however to best understand this let's

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,359
apply some numbers to this

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,240
an actual mathematical equation

45
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,280
so looking at snell's law example number

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,879
one

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,879
light traveling in air which is

48
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,519
refractive index of one hits a piece of

49
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,319
glass

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,039
an angle of 30 degrees the light

51
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,000
refracts

52
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
in the glass at an angle of 15 degrees

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,719
the question is what is the

54
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,640
index of refraction of the glass

55
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,920
so what we first want to do is take the

56
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
components given to us

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,280
and apply them to the equation for what

58
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,798
we know

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,200
so how we would go about this is we'd

60
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
start with the substance one the

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
refractive index

62
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,919
is one that's going to be the air and

63
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
it's it's a piece of glass thing

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,000
of 30 degrees so we know the angle ends

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
substance one we know the refractive

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,359
index

67
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
then the light refracts in the glass an

68
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,280
angle of 15 degrees

69
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,359
so we know the angle what it's asking

70
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
for is what is the refractive index of

71
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,879
that glass what's n2

72
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,878
in this example so if we go back to that

73
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,000
equation we kind of plug everything

74
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,878
in well 1 times the sine of 30

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
equals refractive index of substance 2

76
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,519
times the sine of

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,159
15. so how does that look well 0.5 is

78
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,599
going to equal

79
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,919
0.2588 times n2

80
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,039
solving for n2 we get n2 has a

81
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,159
refractive index

82
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,280
of 1.93 so what is the index of

83
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,039
refraction of the glass

84
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,919
the answer would be 1.93

85
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,639
moving on to example 2 for snell's law

86
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,079
here

87
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,919
slightly different example given here

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
light traveling in air has a refractive

89
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,079
index of one hits a piece of glass at an

90
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,440
angle of 45 degrees

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,000
if the glass has a refractive index of

92
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,479
1.5

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
what angle should the light bend up so

94
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,759
in this example i'm giving you now the

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
refractive index of the class and i'm

96
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,679
asking you now to determine

97
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,640
that angle so just as we did before

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,159
you're going to go through you're going

99
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,958
to find out all the information that you

100
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,679
know we know

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,120
refractive index we know the angle in

102
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,480
substance 1.

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
we don't know the angle of the light

104
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,719
leaves but we do know the refractive

105
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
index

106
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,719
so same as always we plug everything in

107
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
here we're solving for the angle

108
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,719
we go through the same mathematical

109
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,839
process multiply those

110
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,878
leave that there factor that down to the

111
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,000
next step

112
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,280
get point four seven one four equals the

113
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,799
sine of angle two

114
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
going back and taking the inverse sine

115
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
there we're getting that the angle would

116
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,560
be 28

117
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,878
degrees so again here we're solving for

118
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,719
the

119
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,719
angle before we're solving through

120
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,840
refractive index this is kind of both

121
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,080
parts of the

122
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,920
calculating for snell's law now here we

123
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
have some snell's law practice

124
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,238
so i encourage you to pause the video

125
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,719
here take a look at these

126
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
grab a calculator and go through and

127
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,840
solve some of the

128
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,839
for some of these questions because the

129
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
answers appear on the next slide

130
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
and i will be reviewing them in a moment

131
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,119
so again here pause the video

132
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,120
work your way through these and then

133
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
compare your answers to the answers

134
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798
provided

135
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,079
hopefully you've gone through and paused

136
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,358
the video at this time because here i'm

137
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
going to give you the answers

138
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,279
so here are your answers remember the

139
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
first two are referring to refractive

140
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,399
indexes

141
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,519
and the last two are looking at degrees

142
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,599
hopefully you got these

143
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,198
if not i suggest you go back and watch

144
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,080
the video again and hopefully

145
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,680
that will help you be able to answer any

146
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,240
of these questions that may show up in

147
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
the future
