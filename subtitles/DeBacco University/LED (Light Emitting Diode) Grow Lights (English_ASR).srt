1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
okay I'm gonna talk about LED grow

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:08,009
lights which stands for light emitting

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,469
diodes and here's one in the grow 10 by

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:14,218
fluence it's a full spectrum of LED

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:15,689
light so LED stands for again light

6
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,868
emitting diode and this is what they

7
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:21,719
look like many many little tiny diodes

8
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:24,140
that come together to produce that nice

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,368
full spectrum this is where the greatest

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,910
advancements are being made the LED

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,710
light market light fixtures are made up

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,070
of many many small bulbs so these kind

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,570
of diodes the light is efficient and

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,480
directed downwards towards the plant

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,030
canopy LEDs also produce low heat in our

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,949
energy efficient keep in mind Loki does

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,140
that mean no heat but compared to some

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,020
of the other options cooling becomes

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,120
less of a concern here while it's still

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,920
important you may not to be as efficient

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,369
other than compared to some of the other

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,230
lighting options that exist there are

23
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,179
the purple colored lights as we see here

24
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,709
but the full spectrum white lights are

25
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,840
coming on the market and are gaining

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,150
popularity as we see and see here

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,130
because no special glasses are required

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,340
and they provide a presentable gross

29
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:13,798
base and appearance and also benefit the

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,390
plant growing spectrum produced closely

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,920
matches and needs of plants so it's a

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,930
very efficient way to produce light

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,609
these grow lamps are utilizing a

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,570
combination of blue and red to produce

35
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:25,829
spectrums to best fit plants needs this

36
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,429
is why they are gaining popularity

37
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:33,000
because the plants can grow basically

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,180
from seedling to veg to flower under the

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,280
same lighting here now some girls were

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,200
reporting improved cannabinoids and

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,180
terpenoids effect from LED lights

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,280
they're energy efficient compared to

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,560
typical fluorescents and HID lamps and

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,868
generate minimal heat these lights have

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,368
the ability to produce infrared

46
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:53,040
ultraviolet light including colors in

47
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:55,739
between these spectrums and also last

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,990
very long the fluence spider x plus LED

49
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,169
lights can hold peak brilliance which is

50
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:04,468
70 percent or greater for a hundred

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,240
thousand hours so that's a great selling

52
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:08,459
point just there in the sense they don't

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,530
have to keep changing bulbs out or worry

54
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,628
about getting up and you know moving a

55
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,800
fixture if you need to this is one of

56
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,629
these you can put in place

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,870
and be guaranteed for a very long period

58
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:20,120
of time the advantage of the LED lights

59
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,110
and these are the full-spectrum lights

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,050
they're considered to be the future

61
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,420
making improvements and they're even

62
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,830
currently some of the newer ones out are

63
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:33,959
really well advanced lighting options

64
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,540
they offer a full spectrum which is a

65
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,760
great feature they have a very long life

66
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,979
low energy consumption and low heat

67
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,719
production however with all those pros

68
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,060
are still some cons the initial cost

69
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,129
they tend to be more expensive and the

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,699
total coverage area in some cases can be

71
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:54,990
limiting providing one as an example the

72
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:56,969
fluence Viper 2x which I have in the

73
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,100
grow tent here's an example just before

74
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:02,159
I set it up is a full spectrum lights

75
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,699
energy efficient eye at the added dimmer

76
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,250
here

77
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:08,609
it's got great coverage and high ppfd

78
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,060
ratings in addition while these do last

79
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,430
long they have cooling fins there are no

80
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,930
motors here to run cooling fans which

81
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,120
will burn out and cause all sorts of

82
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,180
issues in the long run this is just

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,890
basically passively cooled here and with

84
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,260
the carbon filter and ventilation system

85
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,988
I have I'm able to exhaust the air keep

86
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,819
the general environment at a proper grow

87
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,110
temperature but it's great that there's

88
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:37,169
no fans in here to allow long operation

89
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:39,300
in addition to the diodes and runs

90
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,458
generate some heat but runs relatively

91
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,390
cool the fact that it's dimmable allows

92
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,969
me to use it throughout the entire

93
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,979
growth cycle and has been a great

94
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,250
full-spectrum light to have in the grow

95
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,250
tent
