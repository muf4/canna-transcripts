1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay here we look at the transformation

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:07,019
and genetic material discovery process

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,179
and a couple of the key scientists and

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,879
experiments that they did to kind of

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,629
discover that DNA was the genetic coding

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,580
of the material that cells use so

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,670
starting with the Griffith experiment

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,948
here that occurred in around 1928 he

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,300
discovered that transformation this

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,279
concept of transformation which is gonna

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,260
be an important concept not only for

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,629
this lecture series but also when we get

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,820
to biotechnology his experiment

14
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,609
demonstrated that bacteria get DNA

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,770
through a process called transformation

16
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:41,039
so exactly what is this and what process

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,379
is this and we still use it today so the

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,079
very basics of what transformation is is

19
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:48,799
it's defined as a gene from a bacterial

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,439
cell is move to another bacterial cell

21
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,808
here we have an example we have a blue

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,329
bacteria in a green bacteria now the

23
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,820
blueberry hear produces something that

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,609
we find desirable or we want that this

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,500
green bacteria to be able to produce now

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,939
it could be that this lives in a

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,250
conditions that are just not conducive

28
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,519
to something and the green bacteria here

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,430
is an area that we find we need to find

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,310
or fill a niche so we can transform this

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,220
green bacteria we use a plasmid number

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,290
from prokaryotes which bacteria are they

33
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,259
contain plasmids which are small

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,930
circular DNA we can take the gene of

35
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,590
interest from this cell here and we can

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,329
splice it in to the plasmid that plasmid

37
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,340
then can be inserted back into the

38
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,219
original cell the cell can be

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,579
transformed meaning this cell here is

40
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,618
now producing the substance that this

41
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,859
cell was originally producing we've

42
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,899
transformed this bacteria into now kind

43
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,170
of a merger of the two that the

44
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,489
structure of the green bacteria but the

45
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,409
producing qualities of this blue

46
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,868
circular bacteria an assist of the

47
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,180
plasmid the process of the second

48
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,218
bacterial cell taking up the two new

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,680
genetic material this is what's called

50
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:07,109
transformation now to go into this in

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,319
more detail I've a pretty detailed

52
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:13,080
explanation provided here however the

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,239
process is still the same we have a

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,060
initial sell here in this case our gene

55
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,100
of interest is the small yellow region

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,009
we're inserting that into our

57
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,960
rectangular blue cell here it's taking

58
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,060
up that gene of interest putting into

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,070
its plasmid and replicating it here

60
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,400
so we could see the different phases

61
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,709
that it's gone through and now this cell

62
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,689
now has are able to have the same

63
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,060
genetics produced the same proteins the

64
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:42,810
same end result as this cell originally

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,729
we've transformed this bacteria is what

66
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,229
the process is called another

67
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,329
explanation here doesn't have to be a

68
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:51,179
cell to cell transfer we could purify

69
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,520
plasmid DNA and in here we have a test

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,700
tube with plasmid DNA we can insert that

71
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,890
into a cell and then grow it out in this

72
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,839
case are the genes expressed where the

73
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:03,659
bacteria could be antibiotic resistance

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,659
for selecting for certain bacterial

75
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,719
colonies is important also this occurs

76
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:13,169
in nature in general sense when we're

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,270
looking at genetic and antibiotic

78
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:19,609
resistance developing within a gene pool

79
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,780
of bacteria ok the Griffith experiment a

80
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,570
bacterium exists in two strains

81
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,209
he studied two strains here he studied

82
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,400
the s in the r strain the ax strain here

83
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,819
is smooth key part here as this can

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,800
cause disease in death in animals the

85
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,069
rough strain here is harmless and

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,060
doesn't produce qualities that make it

87
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,919
any reason for concern for animals

88
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,050
animals can survive just fine with the r

89
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,659
strain that's what we call harmless or

90
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,580
non virulent the s strain put it in red

91
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,709
here it can cause disease and this is

92
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,269
one to watch out for in this case it's

93
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,099
produces a polysaccharide coat the

94
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,590
glycocalyx and can cause disease

95
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,019
not all glycocalyx Azure polysaccharides

96
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,750
coats on that that cause disease in this

97
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,459
particular bacterial strain it does here

98
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,009
the rough colonies they don't produce

99
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,090
that exterior coat and therefore they're

100
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,579
considered harmless and they of this

101
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,150
rough strain so the experiment that was

102
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,280
done rough strain non virulent purified

103
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,810
that injected into a mouse waited for a

104
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,269
period of time and the mouse is just

105
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,649
fine that smooth strain is virulent

106
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,299
that's one that causes disease when

107
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,429
that's injected into a mouse sadly the

108
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,960
mouse dies

109
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,449
we take this smooth straight and we heat

110
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,310
kill it we put it in some boiling water

111
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,629
we see the denaturing we see the protein

112
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,269
see nature with you the shape definitely

113
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:39,110
changes and we inject this heat killed

114
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:42,060
smooth strain into the rat or mouse and

115
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,100
it ends up living we basically take it

116
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,860
away the virulent strain for this

117
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,720
however what's most interesting is that

118
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,550
when we take a combination of the rough

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,979
strain which didn't cause disease and

120
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,600
the heat killed smooth strain that

121
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,360
didn't cause disease and we mix them

122
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,879
together we develop a concoction here

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,460
that was added to this mouse and sadly

124
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,529
this mouse ended up dying so what we

125
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,859
notice here is a little different we

126
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:10,288
have two portions that alone did not

127
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,680
cause death and most mouse live in both

128
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:16,050
those cases but when combined we know

129
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,650
sat the nos dies is similar result to

130
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,660
this smooth strain Berlin strain however

131
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:24,000
what's caused here what's potential

132
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,070
reason for this is that we're looking at

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,879
these bacteria these two different

134
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:32,969
strains can cause transformation to

135
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,598
occur the genetics from the heat killed

136
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,220
smooth strain still exists and it can be

137
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:39,899
transferred and taken up by the rough

138
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,900
strain and these two can exchange

139
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,429
material back and forth that's the key

140
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,959
part here that's causing the mouse to

141
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,728
die causing a virulent end result the

142
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,060
AVA experiment was very interested in

143
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:56,430
this particular experimental trial the

144
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,908
he and thus colleagues prepare the same

145
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,550
mixture of dead s in life are bacteria

146
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:04,889
as griffith did then subject to various

147
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,210
experiments all the experience revealed

148
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,728
that the properties of the transferring

149
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,769
principle resembled those of DNA

150
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:13,589
remember we're still trying to discover

151
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:15,209
what the genetic material is same

152
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,709
chemistry and physical properties is DNA

153
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,109
not affected by lipid and protein

154
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,329
extraction not destroyed by protein or

155
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,569
innate that digesting enzymes but

156
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:27,508
destroyed by DNA digesting enzymes so

157
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:29,550
this kind of image shows a great visual

158
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,069
representation of the AVA experiment

159
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,110
we'll look at that in the next slide we

160
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,879
see here we have our mixture of the s

161
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,910
strain vector remember this is the

162
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,060
smooth strain it's virulent causes death

163
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,740
we added our they added different

164
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,310
enzymes we recognize those by the last

165
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,750
three letters ace DNA ace RNA ace

166
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,250
light pace per taste and some other

167
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:55,889
enzymes now produce breaks down proteins

168
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,350
lipase breaks down lipids or fats RNAs

169
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,349
breaks down RNA and DNA breaks DNA

170
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,939
strikes down DNA when these were added

171
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,950
to the different test tubes here and

172
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,469
then added back to the our strain tests

173
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,689
were conducted you can see here in all

174
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,460
of these cases the amount sadly ended up

175
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:13,469
dying

176
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,969
however when DNA ace was added and broke

177
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,390
down the DNA we mixed with the eye

178
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,000
strain the mash is alive this is because

179
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,189
these detain a struct on the DNA and

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,810
then allowed the mouse to survive

181
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:29,160
because it took away the virulence of

182
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,540
the S train one last experiment here

183
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,240
first we need to understand just the

184
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:38,040
basic structure of a virus virus is very

185
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,840
simple as a protein coat with DNA

186
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,700
so it's DNA wrapped in a protein coat

187
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,560
they can look very different but the

188
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,000
structure is basically the same some

189
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,610
look like these kind of alien spider

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,420
looking things some are more like rod

191
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,870
shaped some might be more spherical the

192
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,699
key part is they all are a protein coat

193
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,850
with DNA on the inside something also

194
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:03,240
can be RNA so this hershey-chase

195
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:06,120
experiment viruses that infect bacteria

196
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,189
the simple structure a DNA course run

197
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,079
about a protein coat Hershey and chase

198
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:13,589
use two different redact of isotopes to

199
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,689
label the protein in DNA they incubated

200
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:17,699
the labeled viruses with host bacteria

201
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,610
revealed that only DNA entered the cell

202
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,129
therefore DNA was considered the genetic

203
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,480
material so there's an example of what

204
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,009
they did when it flipped to the next

205
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,040
slide to give you a little bit more

206
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:32,909
detailed look so hurts you cheese

207
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,969
experiment of 1952 to bacteria fathers

208
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,009
here we have our two viruses in this

209
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,650
case sulfur labeled protein capsule the

210
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:43,468
outside here is labeled radioactively

211
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,110
just for tracking purposes in here the

212
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,270
green is the DNA is labeled they're both

213
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,460
allowed to infect the cell both allowed

214
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,710
to kind of lis produce and then at the

215
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,589
end centrifuging

216
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,470
that's spinning the bacterial cells were

217
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,899
looked at the ones that had in this case

218
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,930
the sulfur labeled protein the outer

219
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,000
coat that was labeled they knows no kind

220
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:09,659
of radioactive label materials in the

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
actual cell however in this case where

222
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,889
the DNA was labeled and they purified

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
the cells they did notice the

224
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:18,059
radioactive label and present inside the

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,159
cells this is what provided them

226
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,599
evidence that wasn't the protein at all

227
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,028
and proteins were originally thought to

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,430
be the source of genetic information is

229
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,929
there so many different proteins DNA

230
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,399
only has four different races there's

231
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:31,528
that nobody could that be the possible

232
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,958
well in fact DNA was the genetic

233
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:36,240
information by labeling the DNA and the

234
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,849
viruses and only noticing that located

235
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,940
here and not the protein outer shell

236
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,720
they concluded that DNA was the genetic

237
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,720
material
