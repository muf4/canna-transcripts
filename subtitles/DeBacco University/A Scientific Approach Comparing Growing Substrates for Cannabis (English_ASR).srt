1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,959
when it comes to selecting a substrate

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,120
it can be a very difficult decision so

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,720
on this debacco University video we're

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,400
going to take a scientific approach to

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,230
comparing different growing substrates

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:18,118
for cannabis

7
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:20,439
[Music]

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,559
production all right let's get into the

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,399
study here so first off this is a

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,198
citation for the study if you want to

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,038
look at it in more detail uh here's the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
first page and here's the link and the

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,239
proper Citation for it so when we're

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
looking at any substrate what are

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,640
Growers typically looking for they're

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,960
looking for high paracity a fast

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
draining uh substrate that maintains

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,759
moderate water content between

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,520
irrigations also quick dry Downs to

20
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,399
reduce the risk of root rots and

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,199
pathogens developing well balanced

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,079
physical and chemical properties High

23
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:53,358
consistency and free of weed seeds and

24
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,920
pathogens if it has those properties

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,559
most Growers are going to be seriously

26
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,399
considering that to put their plants

27
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,280
into grow now there's main categories

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,679
talked about in the study uh provided

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,560
here we've got rockwolf and Al foam pet

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,560
based quar based and living soils but

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,159
just a little caption here from the

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,960
article here for their table one looking

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,118
at their physical properties of Pete ma

34
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,199
mix how the height of the substrate can

35
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,519
impact certain things like um uh easy

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,240
available water total available water uh

37
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,560
airfi paracity so just measures that

38
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:27,519
these researchers were taking uh and

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,118
looking at the difference uh based on

40
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,959
the height of that substrate so so let's

41
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,560
start with rock wo here uh at the

42
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,118
beginning and rock wo if you're not

43
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,439
familiar with it is made from basalt

44
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,359
rocks or other minerals which are

45
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:40,039
liquefied at very high temperatures and

46
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,719
then spun into fibers that then can be

47
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,118
made into different sizes and shapes

48
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,959
blocks cubes and slabs we can see the

49
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,599
high consistency here because it is a

50
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,919
man-made material because it's a

51
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,798
man-made material you can see the holes

52
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,200
and that can allow a grower to take a

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,039
smaller plug and place that right into

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,920
the Rockwell Cube now Rockwell can hold

55
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,159
more nutrient solution in air than any

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,320
other growing medium that I'll talk

57
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,520
about here and it's favored as

58
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,078
particularly in these large scale

59
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,118
operations because it is lightweight

60
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,478
inert soiless substrate provides

61
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:12,199
moderate to good Iration excellent water

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,560
holding capacity uh low C easy to handle

63
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,318
and use uh homogeneous very consistent

64
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,759
durable and pathogen-free at least when

65
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,280
you first get it however microbial life

66
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,199
does develop and Rockwell during the

67
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,318
growth cycle of the plants so just keep

68
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,318
that in mind now General benefits of

69
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,079
Rockwell are that the airspace makes

70
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,759
oxygen water and nutrient Solutions and

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,959
easily accessible to plant roots all

72
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,519
good things the high air capacity and

73
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,680
high ratio of easily available water

74
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,759
rockwells are very low unavailable water

75
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,439
which is bounded up water water that's

76
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,719
there but the plants can't use it's very

77
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,519
low in Rockwell promotes uh good root

78
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,519
growth provides even drainage drains

79
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,719
well and has uniform weding so again all

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,519
the things that I really talked about

81
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,840
there from seedling to vegetative stage

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,319
all the way into flowering stage um it

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,519
has these great properties so why would

84
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,598
anyone choose anything else but Rockwell

85
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,080
well there are some downfalls to

86
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,238
Rockwell there are some challenges uh

87
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,200
with Rockwell there's no perfect medium

88
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,480
Rockwell is not environmentally friendly

89
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,199
meaning the durability that it has

90
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,639
during the growing cycle really doesn't

91
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,280
make it easy to dispose of at the end

92
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,119
Rockell may require the use of a wedding

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,560
agent to reduce the hydrophobicity which

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
is repelling of water that it may have

95
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,719
at least initially and those wedding

96
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,318
agents can be washed out over time rock

97
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,560
Will May dry out too fast at the end of

98
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,399
the season when plants are really

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,959
aggressively moving uh transpiring water

100
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,879
uh also Al due to its zero C fertilizers

101
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,120
or nutrients can easily leech out and

102
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,560
could be wasted in contaminate

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,560
groundwater or to simply be wasted um in

104
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,360
the growing cycle Rock wheil typically

105
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,080
has a high pH which require adjustments

106
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,120
by the grower and the low buffering

107
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,120
capacity requires a grower to

108
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,560
continuously monitoring those pH levels

109
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,400
to keep them in the desired range can

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,318
restrict the root environment uh even if

111
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,480
you're using the large slabs um

112
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,839
especially if you're growing plants to

113
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,078
full size and algae growth as we can see

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,120
here is common as it stays moist and can

115
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,040
clog emitters increase disease in insect

116
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,759
pressure now they do make little caps to

117
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,039
put over those to help reduce some of

118
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,359
that we can see they're wrapped on the

119
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,919
side so that can be hopefully mitigated

120
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,640
a little bit by reducing the amount of

121
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,598
light that the top of that rock W gets

122
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,238
now the irrigation of Rockwell high

123
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,478
frequency and low volume and flow

124
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,560
irrigation is recommended so many

125
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,879
irrigation events but low volume which

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
each of those events is key to Rockell

127
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,240
this will help reduce the leaching of

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
nutrients and keep the material moist

129
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,360
when fully dry rock can become

130
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,319
hydrophobic and actually will repel

131
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,120
water and we could use a flood and drain

132
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:37,240
system as we can see um over here or we

133
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,038
can also use U the drip emitters on this

134
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,400
side now phenolic foam is another one

135
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,959
may not have heard of it in that

136
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,839
particular name it's a relatively new

137
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,519
sterilized soiless substrate that comes

138
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,959
in a range of sizes flog foam has that

139
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,959
consistent texture excellent Iration

140
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,120
moderate to low water holding capacity

141
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,239
Superior drainage and it really helps

142
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,680
keep the top surface dryer limiting the

143
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,720
algae growth so it's a little bit more

144
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,680
of an advantage in that department

145
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,560
compared to the Rockall we just talked

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
about but visually looks kind of similar

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,120
now it's often compared to Rockwell as

148
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,799
we can see it does have that same uh

149
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,439
physical look to it um is also presented

150
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,400
as an alternative um no important C or

151
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,600
buffering capacity which means neither

152
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,839
reacts nor changes nutrient-based uh

153
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
Solutions phenolic foam is easy to

154
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,159
handle and to use with no need of

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,680
protective gear or clothing when

156
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,199
handling however it is more fragile than

157
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
Rockwell so you want to be careful when

158
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,319
you are handling it like Rockwell though

159
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,799
is usually non-biodegradable and

160
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,199
therefore can remain as waste and

161
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,680
persist in the environment which again

162
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,919
great to grow the plants in we have to

163
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,360
think about the full cycle even after we

164
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:42,599
produce our our

165
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,720
crop now when we're comparing our two

166
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,080
you can see Rock W right over here

167
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,680
Rockell phol Foams are inert homogeneous

168
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,000
consistent and free of pathogens and

169
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,478
micro microorganisms at least when you

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
go to start Rocko and pH Foams exhibit

171
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
excellent physical properties such as

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,199
high ratios of easy available water

173
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,639
water in airspace even after heavy

174
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,680
watering so we want to be careful with

175
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,280
our watering events the geometry of the

176
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
substrate meaning the height and the

177
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,839
width can impact these physical

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
properties so keep that in mind they are

179
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,519
cubes and there also are come in slab

180
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,439
form select uh selected irrigation is

181
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,399
important to ensure Optimum water air

182
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,120
nutrients to the Cannabis roots and

183
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,399
again that should be low volume but many

184
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,360
frequent uh applications throughout the

185
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,439
day that probably increase as those

186
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,759
plants get

187
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,598
larger now again those environmental

188
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,319
issues uh we can't forget about those

189
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,639
because both are not easily be easily

190
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,280
recyclable or reusable after they're

191
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,598
used for the growing environment High

192
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,318
volumes can can uh lead to leeching

193
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,159
which is common meaning those nutrients

194
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,360
are getting past the root Zone and

195
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,919
getting washed away this can lead to

196
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,598
water contamination with fertilizers

197
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,719
Andor pesticides whatever is being

198
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,360
applied to the crop and as simply as a

199
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,120
grower you're losing that um nutrients

200
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,560
you're losing that increasing that

201
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,079
expense with no return now this is

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,720
Rockell insulation but the same thing

203
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,758
can be applied to the growing cubes

204
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,800
slabs what do you do with them after and

205
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,919
how do you properly and responsibly

206
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,840
dispose of

207
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,359
them so when it comes to irrigation it

208
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,159
is very important we're looking at both

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,160
of these compounds those frequent IR

210
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,280
irrigation events achieved through the

211
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,000
use of substrate sensors and automated

212
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,719
irrigation systems can help maintain

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
voltric water near container capacity

214
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,639
because the goals to prevent excessive

215
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
leeching yes probably a little bit will

216
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,720
come out the bottom we don't want to

217
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,959
keep leeching out those through the

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,319
entire bottom it's not a good thing we

219
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,198
could see here the automatic setup here

220
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,160
uh easily repeatable and they just

221
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
simply get spaced out more as those

222
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,479
plants get

223
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,519
larger now moving on from Rockwell uh

224
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,560
some other competitors to think about uh

225
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,478
would be a Peet based substrate these

226
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,038
are typically harvested in Canadian

227
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,158
sagum Pete Moss uh bogs are from Eastern

228
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,120
Europe countries mainly Scandinavia and

229
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,879
the baltics depending where your end

230
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,918
product is being uh grown or shipped to

231
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,800
the species can vary of the Pete from

232
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,639
bog to bog as well as one region to

233
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,360
another because it is a quote once

234
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,478
living product the addition of course

235
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,240
Peete fibers um or the mixture of

236
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,318
fibrous or chunky materials extracted

237
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,598
from the bog to the Pete Moss can be

238
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,879
used to increase the P's resistance to

239
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,279
shrinkage and compaction helping to

240
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,280
maintain the physical properties mainly

241
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,119
Growers don't want their substrate to

242
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,399
change throughout the growing season

243
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,199
they want that to remain consistent so

244
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,359
the manufacturers may add some things to

245
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,360
help reduce the compaction or shrinkage

246
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,320
that could occur from Moss if it's grown

247
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,639
in as just the pure small

248
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,278
fibers now the Pete Moss there um is a

249
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,918
high buffering capacity for water PH as

250
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,200
well as nutrients it is acidic um

251
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,759
hydrophobic and low in nutrients at

252
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,759
least as itself adiv are Incorporated to

253
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,080
make it a suitable growing media for

254
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,360
plants so typically you're not growing

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,360
in straight uh Pete Moss there will be

256
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,039
some modifications to it this is a

257
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,399
scanning electron microscope view of

258
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,879
what a p Moss particle looks like uh

259
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,519
really really zoomed in you can see all

260
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,278
the little pores um there that help give

261
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,879
it its unique properties it also is a

262
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,320
spongy structure so this kind of can

263
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,879
compress uh without lfi fiber lignified

264
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,278
fibrous material May originate from

265
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,559
other species growing in the peug if any

266
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,399
so again does change a little bit from

267
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,958
Pete bog to Pete bog so uh Pete is RAR

268
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,360
grown in alone so when I say alone that

269
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,518
means just as Pete Pete as an isolate P

270
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,519
based St trates usually have show lower

271
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,560
Iration and gas exchange rate compared

272
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,078
to other categories mainly due to their

273
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,679
particle size and potential for

274
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,399
shrinkage as a result P often has

275
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,958
materials added to it those materials

276
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,440
could be perlite wood or wood fibers and

277
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,838
many others that manufacturers may

278
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,160
choose to use and the goal is to improve

279
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,800
the overall physical properties since

280
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,838
Pete is a living byproduct there can be

281
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,240
variations from P quality s Pete Moss is

282
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,320
usually mixed with other components to

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,360
improve the physical characteristics and

284
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,440
those physical characteristics are help

285
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,120
increase its Iration to reduce its

286
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,200
hydrophobicity meaning repelling of

287
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,000
water and to improve its C now we're

288
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,519
looking at the common components uh that

289
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,958
wouldn't potentially be added to Pete ma

290
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:12,959
growing pearlite vermiculite wood fiber

291
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,439
even quar could be added compost um a

292
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,078
whole bunch of different ones here and

293
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,959
their typical distribution in what

294
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,799
properties are being added are listed

295
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,319
right here so if you're buying some PE

296
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,078
based um substrates they may have other

297
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,399
components mixed in there if you look at

298
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,838
straight Peete making your own consider

299
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,720
adding some of these components to

300
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,839
improve these various physical

301
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,200
properties now the properties versus the

302
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,040
overall usage P substrates show greater

303
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,759
buffering capacity for water PH and

304
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,000
nutrients when compared to Rockwell and

305
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:45,720
phen Foams but is often less popular

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,799
than both of Rockwell and Pho foam

307
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,040
category now going to quar based here uh

308
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,240
we're looking at it's considered a

309
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,360
byproduct of the coconut industry now

310
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
being repurposed for Crop Production so

311
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,440
it's a great way to turn a waste product

312
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,160
into something that's actually usable

313
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,920
common growing media for this category

314
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,240
are pure quar which would be just kind

315
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,599
of a loose based uh could be expandable

316
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,720
blocks uh which are various formulations

317
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,040
of quar pith fiber and hus chips that

318
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
basically will expand um when water is

319
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,159
added to them and we can see canas

320
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,879
plants growing in those right here um

321
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,559
there's qu blocks there's grow bags

322
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,078
there's grow slabs so again a lot of

323
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,719
different forms of this same uh base

324
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:25,319
material quar also has a fairly high can

325
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,600
exchange capacity and therefore can help

326
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,519
retain nutrients so something to

327
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,560
consider compared to some of the other

328
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,839
talked about

329
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,239
previously now the properties again

330
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,320
here's a nice little scanning electron

331
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
microscope view of the core particle

332
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,920
various particle sizes and fine dust to

333
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,759
large chunks so there's again they're

334
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,278
all quar but they have a very different

335
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,159
variant there in their size they hold

336
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:48,078
High volumes of water uh they can have

337
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,039
hydrophilic properties so be mindful of

338
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,359
that particularly early on uh they can

339
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,799
have a tough structure excellent

340
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,560
wetability and can rewet easily reducing

341
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,838
the need for wedding agents so something

342
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,719
that's going to remain consistent

343
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,079
throughout the growing cycle they have a

344
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,160
slow break down rate and therefore

345
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,719
doesn't shrink during production cycle

346
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,240
and can have higher Iration in drainage

347
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
but this can depend on the size and

348
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,120
particle distribution of the particular

349
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,559
product that you are

350
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,240
using now often qu base is seen as an

351
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,078
alternative to rock wall so here's

352
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,680
Rockwell and there's our quar based the

353
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:20,000
aration and drainage can be similar to

354
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,919
Rockwell so that's something Growers

355
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,120
tend to like however Rockwell is not

356
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,399
easily is not easily recyclable or

357
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,399
reasonable after where the coconut quar

358
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,198
products can uh be relatively

359
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,159
sustainable can be reused can be chopped

360
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:34,799
up can actually be composted there's

361
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,159
things that could be done with those

362
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,679
that are simply not possible with rock

363
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,439
wool now with quar again no perfect

364
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,519
media so we have to consider salts

365
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
because qu can have high salt levels if

366
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,759
it's not washed or buffered however

367
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
salts are relatively soluble and leech

368
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,159
so it's not like some it's going to stay

369
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,639
in there forever they can be leech we

370
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,519
want to try to do this before we put our

371
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,680
plants in the cells that need to be uh

372
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,959
that tend to be found in this is sodium

373
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,599
potassium chloride and therefore may

374
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,359
cause a risk of calcium and magnesium

375
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,079
deficiency in plants which is why a

376
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,079
calmag fertilizer is highly recommended

377
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,479
to have on hand if you're choosing this

378
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,838
growing substrate these elements must be

379
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,000
mitigated or replaced with more

380
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,040
beneficial ones um and that's why calmag

381
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,559
can help do that over a period of time

382
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,838
now car dealing with those salts how do

383
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,439
we go about dealing with those salts

384
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,680
well some manufacturers wash car with

385
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,720
fresh water to remove excessive salts we

386
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,838
can see here triple washed on this uh

387
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,278
package here but users should test to

388
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,160
make sure um that they are sufficiently

389
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,720
low enough for their lying that can be

390
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,399
done with a PO through and taking the EC

391
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,079
or the PPM of the flushing water through

392
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,159
another technique is to use certain

393
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,000
mineral salts most common calcium salts

394
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,639
during the washing to force the exchange

395
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,159
of excessive elements with more

396
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,079
beneficial elements with the resulting

397
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,319
product saying to be buffered so if you

398
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,679
see something that's buffered a lot of

399
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,079
times that's not just washed with pure

400
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,799
water it's wash with a calcium

401
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,799
containing water to help replace some of

402
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,399
those non-desirable elements with more

403
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,719
desirable ones from a plant growing

404
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,399
standpoint buffering this is chemical

405
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,600
process process which excessive sodium

406
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,440
and potassium bound to the quar replaced

407
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,120
by calcium help prevent a calcium and

408
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,240
magnesium deficiency during the growing

409
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,278
cycle still good to have those products

410
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,360
on hand though uh because those plants

411
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:15,759
will probably be consuming those period

412
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,480
of time is allowed for the exchange to

413
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,320
take place and then leached and dried to

414
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,800
the open air the efficacy of the

415
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,720
buffering is variable among

416
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,838
manufacturers and depends on the volume

417
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,399
of water for leeching the buffering

418
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,240
salts used and the time period allowed

419
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,679
for the cadine exchange to occur so all

420
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,480
things that need to be taken into

421
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,719
consideration which is why it's good for

422
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,959
Growers just to double check um their

423
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,399
poth throughs and to watch their plants

424
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,879
as they're growing to make sure they

425
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,600
have that calag on hand just in

426
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,720
case now the Iration of qu um the higher

427
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,879
ration of qu helps maximize the root

428
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,079
zone for the crops increased root growth

429
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,519
leads to increased water and nutrient

430
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,239
uptake lack of oxygen poration in the

431
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,799
root zone is a strong contributing

432
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,720
factor for the infection and spread of

433
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,078
root pathogens something Growers really

434
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,240
want to avoid so Iration is so important

435
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:06,679
in these substrates gar does have the

436
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,600
reputation for being difficult to

437
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,638
overwater and is associated with reduced

438
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,360
instance of disease again all beneficial

439
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,799
thing it's really hard to overwater it

440
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,800
even in the finer particles it does have

441
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,198
a tcy to drain through pretty well using

442
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,000
the larger particles even easier to pour

443
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,359
through but keep in mind that may

444
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,278
require adjustments to your

445
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,278
irrigation again no perfect media what

446
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,120
are some of the drawbacks or

447
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,000
disadvantages well cor products going

448
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,000
have higher variation particle size and

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,919
chemical properties such as their salt

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,759
levels their concentrations of sodium

451
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,919
pottassium chloride and the amount of

452
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,199
buffering that they do have so I always

453
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,240
recommend having that Cal magag on hand

454
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,639
now looking at the comparisons of our

455
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,480
quar they tend to be more flexible to

456
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,480
irrigation management can be easily

457
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,120
adopted to low or high frequency

458
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,159
irrigation strategies compared to Pete

459
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,399
qu usually uh shows better physical

460
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,679
properties uh Iration being one of them

461
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,799
and compared to rock wool and Al Foams

462
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,399
SAR has a higher buffering capacity for

463
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,359
water PH as well as nutrients and here

464
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,720
we can see it kind of in the grow bag uh

465
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,240
form here when switching from roell to

466
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,000
finocam quar based substrates there is a

467
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
need to adjust irrigation strategy

468
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,318
because the water Dynamic is different

469
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,759
in those materials so don't think I'm

470
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:20,759
just going to change substrates and keep

471
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,600
everything the same watch those plants

472
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,440
watch those irrigation events because

473
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,920
more than likely adjustments will need

474
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,720
to be made now moisture retention and um

475
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,679
curves for soiless medium we can see

476
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,759
that quar is most similar to Pete Moss

477
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,479
and rock Foams are also similar so here

478
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,480
we can see the kind of water potential

479
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,879
and the volumetric water how different

480
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,759
things track so if you're going from

481
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,360
kind of a quar based uh kind of to more

482
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,278
of a Pete Moss based the irrigation

483
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,560
changes might be minimal but if you're

484
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,838
going from either a quar or Pete Moss to

485
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,359
a rock or FAL foam we could see those

486
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,800
have vastly different properties there

487
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,759
and here's some of the physical

488
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,838
properties of rock foar and the Pete MTH

489
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,000
looking at the total morosity container

490
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,558
capacity so on and so forth Just so you

491
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
can have an idea of what the actual

492
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,759
physical properties are of a media or

493
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,199
substrate that you're using or one

494
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,798
you're considering or one you might be

495
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,959
considering changing

496
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,480
too now lastly I want to talk about

497
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,439
living soils uh which is a category of

498
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,360
its own but really doesn't have any

499
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,759
really defined standards it can be as

500
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,798
simple as incorporating microbial

501
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,199
inoculant into growing medium uh but it

502
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,759
can be much more complex than that

503
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,160
living soil Matrix must support

504
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,679
microbial population in biodiversity is

505
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,519
important to maintain a balance between

506
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,960
mineralization plant protection as well

507
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,879
as bio stimulation the basic components

508
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,679
of living soil are Pete Moss quar quar

509
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,320
chunks naturally AED bark wood fiber

510
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,240
compost and natural additives with no

511
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,038
set percentage of any of these um

512
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
determined under the definition of

513
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:50,200
living soils a variety of inoculant can

514
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,840
also be used in living soils such as

515
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,159
compost bacterial inoculant microa which

516
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:58,839
is a fungal based eomes just to name a

517
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,919
few now living soil is not free of ch

518
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,319
challenges as well as the other subes

519
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,720
that I talked about so challenges living

520
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,399
soils maintaining a balance between

521
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,798
mineralization plant protection and

522
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,320
biostimulation is important as well as

523
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,319
optimizing physical properties which

524
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,960
I'll talk more about provide enough

525
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,798
nutrients for the complete growth cycle

526
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,519
manage irrigation to prevent leeching of

527
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,798
nutrients as well talk all about those

528
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,720
three properly defining living soil is

529
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,158
needed as this helps with setting

530
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,600
standards for comparison uh when you're

531
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,200
talking about substrates in general now

532
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,798
optimization those physical properties

533
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,840
will non-living soil fast draining

534
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,599
course well aerated substrate properties

535
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,918
allow for leeching of excessive

536
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:38,439
nutrients and daily nutrient feeding

537
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,280
living soils physical properties the

538
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,880
water and air exchange can be limited du

539
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,678
the materials that are being chosen to

540
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,760
use so for example compost um which is

541
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,559
often used the living soil component um

542
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,879
microorganisms can also modify the

543
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,798
substrate structure so it's a important

544
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,679
variable to take into

545
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,200
consideration now providing nutrients

546
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,798
for the full growth cycle as I said that

547
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,360
can be a challenge because nutrient

548
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,279
availability is a second challenge when

549
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,000
we're looking at our living soils

550
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,440
cannabis grows very fast in a short

551
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,720
period of time typically 8 to 14 weeks

552
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,440
it needs nutrients to rapidly become

553
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,960
available in high concentrations living

554
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,960
soil can struggle to have enough

555
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,919
available Plant Nutrition to meet the

556
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,919
high demand of this growing cycle

557
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,280
Growers often overcharge their growing

558
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,520
media with more than necessary amounts

559
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,639
of natural fertilizers to ensure the

560
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,038
availability for the full grow cycle

561
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,960
there is a balance though between

562
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,279
toxicity and plant available nutrients

563
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,519
that Growers need to take into

564
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,399
consideration plants growing growing and

565
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,079
living soil tend to be slower compared

566
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,919
to soil as substrate option so keep that

567
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,720
in mind it's also important to know that

568
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,559
the plant's going to need different

569
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,360
nutrients as it goes through its

570
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,798
different life cycle so just because

571
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,119
you're high in one nutrient doesn't mean

572
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,480
you can maintain that one nutrient

573
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,519
really high throughout the entire growth

574
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,279
cycle there will be the plant demands

575
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,480
for shifting nutrients as it goes from

576
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,200
that seedling to that vegetative to that

577
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,159
flowering stage

578
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
and then lastly to manage uh irrigation

579
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,280
to prevent leeching of nutrients

580
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,120
irrigation strategies a third challenge

581
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,319
in living soil mainly due to the

582
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,918
variance of the physical properties

583
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,798
regulating the plants irrigation is how

584
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,280
Growers manage air to water ratios in

585
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:15,918
the root Zone and it's not as forgiving

586
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,519
as some of the other U soiless

587
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,559
substrates he talked about where they

588
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,119
allows that water to kind of pour

589
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:24,038
through so lastly to end here with the

590
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,798
best growing uh substrate I figured I

591
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,480
should come to some conclusion here

592
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,158
since if you have tuned in for this long

593
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,519
and it's not as easy to suggest what

594
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,960
growing media is the best growing media

595
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,759
for cannabis production because each

596
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,880
category has its strengths as well as

597
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,400
its weaknesses and choosing any of these

598
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,960
categories depends a lot on the Grower's

599
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,559
technique and the production system you

600
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,360
are utilizing take into account many

601
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:47,319
factors When selecting what ststate to

602
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,479
utilize and try to make a wise decision

603
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:51,319
with the information presented here if

604
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,880
you have no idea where to start I would

605
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,399
say quar based products are probably uh

606
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,400
the intermediate substrate showing more

607
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,240
advantages and less weaknesses if you're

608
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,120
looking for a starting point

609
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,400
expand car bags allow for minimal

610
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,678
storage space if you're looking at a

611
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,720
large scale operation sterile starting

612
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,759
conditions and supportive growing

613
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,400
substrate so hopefully you like this

614
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,759
very long but detailed look at

615
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,000
substrates to make to allow you to make

616
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,599
an informed and scientific based

617
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
decision for what your plants will be

618
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,000
growing in
