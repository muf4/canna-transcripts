1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
okay there's many things that go into an

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,660
efficient growing operation here and

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,550
tell this growing on the bottle what

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,160
this refers to is growing on a bottled

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,719
carbon dioxide is there some of the

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,210
things that you'll need to allow the

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,039
system to work effectively we have some

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,949
tubing here with some holes in it to

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,840
allow delivery we have a regulator we

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,949
have a timer pictured here I'm gonna go

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,170
over a controller and where he would

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,590
place this so growing on the bottom this

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,260
is bottled co2 that is compressed co2

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,090
here's is a 20-pound bottle it consists

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,670
of that regulator that's attached to the

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,070
bottle the monitor or controller I just

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,829
have chosen user controller here and it

18
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,409
isn't abled with fuzzy logic to allow

19
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,628
for a precise and dosage of co2 to my

20
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:48,390
plants these work in unison to help

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,949
maintain predetermine co2 levels I'm so

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,370
it's important that all these kind of

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,230
work together are all linked up for the

24
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,988
efficient delivery of car mats head to

25
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:00,718
your plants now the co2 bottle system

26
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:02,640
co2 gas is stored and sold in metal

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,849
pressurized cylinders typically under

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,579
high pressure up to 2000 psi and PSI

29
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,839
stands for pounds per square inch co2 is

30
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,158
common least for welding fire

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,500
extinguishers carbonated beverages

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,750
exodus' but our common place is now in

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,938
grow facility because of the potential

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,060
for increasing yield assuming co2 is a

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,219
limiting factor the co2 tanks common

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,790
solar sizes are 10 pound 20 pound and 50

37
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,099
pounds

38
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,140
however keep in mind that this 10 20 and

39
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,179
50 pounds is the weight of the co2

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,189
you're purchasing and not the total

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,460
weightless co2 in the bottle that

42
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:38,339
contains it for example a 50 pound steel

43
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:41,938
cylinder with co2 with 50 pounds of co2

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,290
will actually weigh about 170 pounds so

45
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,478
keep this in mind if you're looking at

46
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,670
storing or moving or transporting these

47
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,349
bottles they will weigh much more than

48
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,099
just what's stated or what you may think

49
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,089
anyway co2 tank safety pressurized

50
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,099
bottles can be dangerous

51
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,469
even if the guests inside co2 is non

52
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,908
flammable and essentially inert the high

53
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,228
pressure can create a rocket like the

54
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,960
fact if the regulator becomes suddenly

55
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,359
broken or damaged as a result be sure

56
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,429
tanks have a protective color so in this

57
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,288
tank this was example be an unsafe tank

58
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,598
there's no protective collar over this

59
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,659
valve this was to break this create very

60
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,000
dangerous in Scituate

61
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,810
do the pressurize of gas this is what

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,060
you want to have anyone have that

63
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,640
predictive color in some way over that

64
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,370
tank just to help reduce the chance of

65
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,489
causing any sort of rocket like our

66
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,629
dangerous conditions if this was to fall

67
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,670
over a break

68
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,669
or get damaged here by something falling

69
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:35,439
on it the regulators I mentioned another

70
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:37,509
critical step here this gets hooked up

71
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,520
to the bottle right here these work with

72
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:41,679
a controller look it's plugged in to

73
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,130
release co2 at a predetermined rate

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,870
which can be evident here running at

75
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,090
0.08 CFM or cubic feet per minute is

76
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,640
considered about the standard just to

77
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,710
give you just a general idea of what to

78
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,319
shoot for it can be higher or lower than

79
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,760
that depending on your operation keep in

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,609
mind though if you are releasing it at

81
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,009
very high volumes about 0.33 cubic feet

82
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,570
per minute or greater when co2 is

83
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,609
released at these high volumes there's

84
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,949
be a strong cooling effect which can

85
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,960
freeze the solenoid to be an extreme

86
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:14,199
example here of that cooling effect of

87
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,420
high release of co2 to counteract this

88
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,879
some growers who installed heaters are

89
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:21,069
looking at high-volume operations will

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,349
heat the co2 to eliminate the regulator

91
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,669
from freezing up this is what they look

92
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,469
like here again this would attach to the

93
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:28,419
tank and then this part here would

94
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,699
attach to the regulator this needs a

95
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:32,169
power source so keep that in mind this

96
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,659
would need a power source to help warm

97
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,489
up so that the co2 always have a strong

98
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,699
chilling effect wound that caused a

99
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,650
regulator here to freeze and lock up now

100
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,709
to deliver our co2 an efficient delivery

101
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,090
system small eight inch tubing has laser

102
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,789
holes drilled in it you can see one

103
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,110
right here one here one here on equal

104
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:52,449
distances to allow for equal

105
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,030
distribution of co2 over a large area

106
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,229
this can allow that night circulating

107
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,539
you're not just getting one little point

108
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,310
of injection you're getting over a large

109
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,780
area

110
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,280
now that delivery system installation if

111
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,259
you notice the black tubing runs along

112
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,180
the back of the protein here and it

113
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:08,949
comes down and around here and up here

114
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,540
this allowed to open the doors here

115
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,939
without having to be to get in the way

116
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,439
to be able to trim plants or take plants

117
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,750
in or out if needed

118
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,759
there's their small holes so allow equal

119
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,858
distribution but I also installed a fan

120
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,629
just above them and this is pointed on a

121
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,240
slight downward angle to help stir the

122
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,829
air the sensor is also placed above the

123
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,579
tubing allowing for an accurate reading

124
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,199
on these

125
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:31,060
ditions so keep in mind that is

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,520
important to allow this system to work

127
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,098
completely in unison and this is cooked

128
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,408
up to a controller with fuzzy logic as a

129
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:40,990
result this creates a nice way of dosing

130
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:43,418
co2 and creating nice consistent

131
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,658
conditions for the plants to allow for

132
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:49,149
efficient operation for the entire grow

133
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:51,879
cycle keep in mind also you only want to

134
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:54,728
deliver co2 when the lights are on and I

135
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:58,590
control that through the programming of

136
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,589
my timer that has fuzzy logic
