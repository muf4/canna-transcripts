1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,548
so here we look at the organization of

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,919
vascular plants the three images here

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,289
all show vascular plants now they fall

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,960
into different categories or subsets

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,689
these would be seedless vascular plants

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,118
these people call herbaceous vascular

7
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:21,300
plants there should be woody vascular

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,730
plants so looking at general plants

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,368
contain growth stones of unspecialized

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,189
cells called meristems there's a primary

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,130
growth is initiated at the tips of roots

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,659
and shoots by the apical meristems the

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,579
growth of these meristems results

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,859
primary in the extension of the plant

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,239
body so we're looking at where we're

16
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:44,789
growing taller secondary growth involves

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,128
the activity of lateral meristems this

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,500
is can continue divisions of their cells

19
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,589
results in primary thickening of the

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,509
plant bodies so we have a thickening in

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,770
the image here a primary growth would

22
00:00:54,509 --> 00:01:00,269
occur here here here here and we also

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,539
can't forget about the root tips as

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,920
where all the primary growth will occur

25
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,689
secondary growth we will get the lateral

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,079
growth would be example to the tree

27
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,250
trunk the trunk would be thickening

28
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:15,170
where our primary growth would be those

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,060
actively growing and dividing tips

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,219
so these epical meristems tissue most

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,890
plants containing undifferentiated cells

32
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,259
found in areas of growth so does the

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,150
growing tips now many people think and

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,650
associate with the you know the chute

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,109
tips other doesn't people called

36
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,240
meristem which is true but we also can't

37
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,459
forget about the root tips that occur

38
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,859
below ground if you remember in the lab

39
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,349
that we did we looked at cells going

40
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,810
through high rates of mitosis and these

41
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,328
were root tip cells same thing is

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,409
happening here at the shoot tip and both

43
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,048
of these are considered

44
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,420
apical meristems if we flip back for a

45
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,118
second this is all involved in primary

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,140
growth phase growing with the height of

47
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:00,629
the plant good you know with that this

48
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,899
primary growth is made except plants

49
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:06,390
longer or taller again it's that

50
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,500
vertical growth but also please don't

51
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,229
forget about the growth it's also

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,120
correctable low and soil line there this

53
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,390
is our primary growth that's occurring

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,460
we're going to

55
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,839
transition-related secondary growth here

56
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,599
at a moment right now we're just

57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,599
focusing on that primary growth getting

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,400
the secondary growth leader that's where

59
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,530
plants developed a new pattern of growth

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,569
which a ring of cells could divide

61
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,659
around the periphery of the plant yeah

62
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,799
this is the end of a general plan

63
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,990
secondary growth allows for plants them

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,600
to increase in diameter the thickening

65
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,629
of that the product of secondary growth

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,669
is wood as we see here these would be

67
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,069
examples of what we call woody plants

68
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:49,059
versus herbaceous plants that just grow

69
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:52,060
like a tomato plant now these lateral

70
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,189
meristems there's two types here first

71
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,959
one being vascular cambium and this

72
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:58,569
gives rise to thick accumulations of

73
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,200
secondary xylem and phloem look it right

74
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,590
here

75
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,079
that's our vascular cambium our cork

76
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,030
cambium forms the outer layer of bark on

77
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,410
both roots and shoots so that's layers

78
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,020
located right here

79
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,729
so we see that bastard Kim distinct

80
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,680
separation between these two regions

81
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,030
here and our core came in a little bit

82
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,530
harder to see but you can see there is

83
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,640
definitely a distinctive line here going

84
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,000
in a little bit more detail in the

85
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,189
vascular cambium in stems secondary

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,590
growth is initiated by the

87
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:31,389
differentiation of the vascular cambium

88
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,459
so this thin layer of actively dividing

89
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,609
cells is located from the bark in the

90
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,170
main stem in woody plants and this is

91
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,660
running between the xylem and the phloem

92
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,099
so here's our xylem and here's our phone

93
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,799
we see this thin layer here's our

94
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:47,469
vascular cambium cells that divide from

95
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,319
the vesser to outwardly INSAS towards

96
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:53,109
the bark become secondary phloem being

97
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,150
in this region here in cells a divide

98
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,760
from the Vasa Cameron Cameron me towards

99
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,459
the center of the tree would become

100
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,729
secondary xylem that's important

101
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,530
remember that our xylem here is number

102
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,539
we I showed you some other videos what

103
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,659
it looks like tends to be this larger

104
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:13,539
more open region there they say new

105
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:16,180
cells are dead at maturity form is a lot

106
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:18,219
more sugar transport it's located in

107
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,160
what he plans closer to the bark region

108
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,479
they're much smaller the faster cambium

109
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,849
is what's kind of separating the two

110
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,060
here and depending on what side you're

111
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,860
on

112
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,230
depends what your ultimate is going to

113
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,420
be

114
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,640
in this side are developing a secondary

115
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,390
phloem and towards the inward part are

116
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,009
secondary xylem that cork cambium as we

117
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,019
see pictured here and zoomed in right

118
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,000
here while the Vassar caimans being

119
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,039
established a second kind of lateral

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,040
cambium develops in the stems are layer

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,590
this is the cork cambium this consists

122
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,560
of plates of dividing cells move deeper

123
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:52,669
and deeper into the stem as we divide

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,639
outwardly this came and divides to form

125
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:57,680
densely packed cork cells inwardly this

126
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,519
cambium divides produce a layer of

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,620
prankin cells

128
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,609
so as we see here this image to make it

129
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,259
try to make it as simple as possible

130
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,290
there's a piece of wood we cut in half

131
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,779
the cork and cork cambium are located

132
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,210
very close to the surface they together

133
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:13,309
make the period erm and along with the

134
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:15,409
secondary phloem makes the dark region

135
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,819
you might be film I was seeing the

136
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,310
Vassar canyons looking a little bit more

137
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,839
inwardly and that secondary xylem you're

138
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,980
definitely getting closer to that center

139
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:27,349
portion of the tree that period er the

140
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,150
cork of cork cambium and the parenchymal

141
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,400
cells collectively make up what's called

142
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:34,009
a period erm the appearance of plants

143
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,049
outside protective covering the term

144
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,569
bark refers to all the tissues in a

145
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,819
mature stem or root outside the vascular

146
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,040
cambium as we see here so all of this

147
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:45,409
would be considered in the bark not just

148
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,080
a very thin layer here what is

149
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,760
accumulated secondary xylem so the true

150
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,639
part of wood would be the interior

151
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,250
portion here technically the bark as we

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,689
may associate it as with wood is

153
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,089
separate and distinctive from the wood

154
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,889
we wouldn't make a 2x4 that contains

155
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:03,439
bark those get that partion it's shaved

156
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,099
off and the secondary xylem which is the

157
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,779
wood is what used for structural support

158
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,300
rings of a tree because of the way this

159
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:13,279
is accumulated wood often displays rings

160
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,710
the vasser came and divides more

161
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,169
actively in the spring in the summer

162
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,669
than in the fall and winter the growth

163
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,740
rate differences are reflected in

164
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,110
alternating rings of growth of different

165
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,379
thicknesses you can see that evident

166
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,569
here a lot can be told from a tree here

167
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:31,579
you can see it's early part of its life

168
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:34,099
it grew very quickly you see the large

169
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,569
space between the rings however at this

170
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,970
point in its life is seen the Rings are

171
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,909
a lot closer together indicating growth

172
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,920
from year to year was much slower

173
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,270
we don't have to cut down the tree to

174
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,689
get an assessment of the tree rings

175
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:49,819
inside cannon becomes xylem the outside

176
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:52,279
came out ourselves becomes the phloem we

177
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,750
can take a core of a tree so as you see

178
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,659
here we take these cores we just simply

179
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,939
pull out a core tropical plants though

180
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,450
may not have distinctive rings as we see

181
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:04,209
here also rings may vary in size these

182
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,439
are good questions to be thinking about

183
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:08,599
remember that we said that in the

184
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,660
Northeast our plants our trees tend to

185
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,650
grow slower in the fall and winter and

186
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,360
faster than the spring and summer

187
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,549
tropical plants are gonna grow more

188
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,670
consistently mechanic naming that have

189
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,960
these divisions or rings that develop

190
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,520
rings may vary in size because of

191
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,659
environmental factors with that tree

192
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:29,180
might be experiencing once we know that

193
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,530
each ring develops after a year when we

194
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,199
know the year that she was cut down in

195
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:36,139
this case 2017 we can trace back

196
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,990
determine how old that tree is in when

197
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,750
it may have been first planted here we

198
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,150
just have some important historical kind

199
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,860
of points of interest throughout the

200
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:48,349
different years that this particular

201
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,819
tree was growing and here you see the

202
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,840
different tags that could mark different

203
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:56,029
rings on the tree so I posed a question

204
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,039
history of a tree stump what was going

205
00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:00,019
on with this tree we could see there's a

206
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,210
lot more growth towards this upper

207
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:04,609
region then it was down here this could

208
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,569
be there could be shade on this portion

209
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,460
of the plant it could be more

210
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,740
competition they could have been more

211
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,329
sunlight on this side easier to grow and

212
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,400
that's why I figured the differences

213
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,870
here so it's important to look at a tree

214
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,789
stomping you can tell a little bit of

215
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,620
the history of what that tree

216
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,069
experienced asthma's grow throughout its

217
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,069
life cycle
