1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,379
good here I'm going to go over this

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,679
brief overview of the five themes that

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,000
unify biology kind of make it a whole

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,939
encompassing unit

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,910
well first one is evolution June Fink

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,410
it's these change in a species over time

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,810
terms we're going to work with when we

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,969
get into the topic of evolution will be

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,278
genetic drift natural our official

10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,809
selection and founder effects well

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,489
there's just a quick overview here is

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,518
before selection we have all these

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,829
circles are different colors sorry for

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,320
colorblind we notice here after

15
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,299
selection the red and the dark red or

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,549
the favored for this particular

17
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,589
environment or stress that occurred and

18
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,019
our final population for those that can

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,600
see color are composed of red and dark

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,059
red and the yellows and tans and oranges

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,579
were selected again also here have a

22
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,799
migrating population and we have a

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,359
couple generations that occur do planner

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,269
effects we see the purple ones here were

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,448
the most advantageous so one of the five

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,059
themes that unify biology is evolution

27
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:05,280
the second theme the flow of energy all

28
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,368
or all living organisms require energy

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,400
the Sun is the source of energy for most

30
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,560
ecosystems except for some organs that

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,710
live way down in the deep ocean vast

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,420
majority though otherwise the Sun is the

33
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,089
main source of energy plants capture

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,009
energy via photosynthesis and they can

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,140
act as an energy source for other

36
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,709
organisms you see here the sun's energy

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,090
at the very bottom that's producing for

38
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,709
our primary producers that's their main

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,259
source of energy then the primary

40
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,750
consumers and secondary consumers third

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,359
level consumers apex predators a lot of

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,219
energy is being lost to heat again we

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,319
can't create or destroy energy but a lot

44
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,509
is being lost to heat then these are

45
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,609
being broken down by decomposers those

46
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,310
nutrients are being recycled and the

47
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,289
kind of circle goes around notice 100

48
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,210
percent then 10 percents is how much

49
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,610
we're losing to heat this is why there's

50
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,968
so few apex predators and so many

51
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,409
primary producers third theme that

52
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:03,688
unifies biologies interaction

53
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,790
interaction between organs is critical

54
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,228
for evolution there's social behavior

55
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,629
that occurs when organs of the same

56
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,340
species live in direct contact so you

57
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,590
see here with the meerkats these are

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,300
highly social animals

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,340
it's community dynamics that occurs when

60
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,620
organs of different species live in

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,000
direct contact with one another and this

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,330
could be an example here we have the

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,610
butterfly in the flower two very

64
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,489
different species put interacting in a

65
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,920
community like way the fourth theme that

66
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,019
unifies biology's structure determines

67
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,518
function should be very important to go

68
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,459
over macromolecules specifically

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,250
proteins but biological structures are

70
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,439
well-suited to their function this is

71
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,900
very true at every level organization

72
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,269
the example I get here is the sequence

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,129
of amino acids leads to a specific

74
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,590
structure that can lead to a very

75
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,659
specific function the example here would

76
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,090
be enzymes that are have a very

77
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,579
specialized active site that only bind

78
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,610
to one particular substrate so their

79
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,989
structure determines their function

80
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,720
lastly the last thing that unifies

81
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,128
biologies homeostasis all of the organs

82
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,409
act to maintain a relatively stable

83
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:12,628
internal environment in maintaining

84
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,400
homeostasis requires energy a lot of

85
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:16,679
singling back and forth between cells

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,170
need to have positive feedback and

87
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,969
negative feedback systems here as a way

88
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,888
to lower things or erase things to

89
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:26,459
maintain these relatively stable

90
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,350
internal conditions so just to quickly

91
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,539
review all five you can see them listed

92
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,189
right here and provide them in

93
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:34,138
individual size and broke them down with

94
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:37,259
images that hopefully make it more

95
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,150
memorable so you're able to make

96
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,989
connections with the five themes that

97
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,989
unify biology
