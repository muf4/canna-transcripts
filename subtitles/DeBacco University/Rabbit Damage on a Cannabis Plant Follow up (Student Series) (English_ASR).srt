00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,620
welcome to this debaco University

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:06,660
follow-up video from one of our previous

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,339
student series with Kira looking at

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,839
rabbit damage so here we're going to

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,879
look at rabbit damage on Kim's plant

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,859
with a follow-up on how to mitigate and

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,860
help get these plants to harvest

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,600
[Music]

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,118
now here it's the return of the rabbits

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,039
so while they're nice and small they

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,079
were doing quite a large bit of damage

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,759
and there was fencing around the entire

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,799
area but it had simply had too many

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,480
points of entry for the small rabbits

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,759
it's like any good grower you're going

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,119
to analyze the situation and develop a

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,320
method try to mitigate that

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,419
analyzing the situation that seemed like

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,700
there was a concentrated area for this

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,679
damage so individual plant protective

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,260
measures were put in place to help

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,939
Savage the Salvage the plants and these

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,619
plants were of the Fairly large size

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,000
luckily the rabbits hadn't come in

25
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,218
earlier they can simply just mow down

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,019
the entire plant and again while rabbits

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,359
are small they could still damage fully

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,519
grown cannabis plants so it kind of had

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
reminiscent themes of the Monty Python

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,140
rabbit there where it's able to take

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,140
down and Destroy something very much

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,840
much larger than the rabbit itself

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,359
so the overall method is very quick

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,740
which is kind of key it's a simple

35
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,118
method which doesn't take much time

36
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,158
which makes it more likely to be

37
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,900
implemented simply putting an arbor

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,580
guard tree trunk protector as we can see

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,320
right here with a zip tie or on the stem

40
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,000
ground level the reason why they're so

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,500
cost effective they only cost about two

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,540
dollars and fifty cents to under two

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,400
dollars per guard and it simply depends

44
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,439
on how many you buy as far as the price

45
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,060
for the plants that had damage a simple

46
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,699
stake here we can see right on the side

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,200
and a rope was support was added watch

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,579
out for drip lines though under the weed

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
barrier when you're punching that stake

50
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:47,759
in the ground always find a way to kind

51
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,398
of find one or two so make sure you

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,019
repair that if you do or do move it away

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,180
at the beginning before you do go

54
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,618
through and punch the stake in this can

55
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,780
be put around other plants too to

56
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,459
prevent the issue from happening as a

57
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,019
preventative as well

58
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,399
now these are here it's going to

59
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,920
demonstrate just kind of how they look

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,560
on the actual plant they are meant also

61
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,500
to keep line trimmers from damaging tree

62
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,759
trunks so they are pretty uh rigid they

63
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,680
are pretty solid and they can be

64
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,959
utilized from year to year I would just

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,640
recommend you sterilize them so let's go

66
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,280
out to the field there and let's hear

67
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,378
from Kira about our follow-up on our

68
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,598
rabbit damage

69
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:27,060
this is a continuation of our bunny

70
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,818
damage video a few weeks ago a bunny

71
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,979
came through and Nod on the bottom of

72
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,799
our beautiful cannabis plant here and

73
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:37,199
resulted in actually falling down and so

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,840
our response to this was to put a collar

75
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,878
on the bottom of our plant to make sure

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,979
that the bunnies can't come through and

77
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,299
start gnawing on this again that perfect

78
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,459
bunny level

79
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,920
and another thing that we did was add

80
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,860
supports since this was like I said

81
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,259
trampled to the ground pretty much we it

82
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,239
needed extra support and to be able to

83
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,219
keep itself upright if we didn't add

84
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,340
these Stakes then it would still be on

85
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,080
the ground when this plant fell this

86
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,060
Branch specifically endured a lot of

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,459
damage I mean it's pretty much almost

88
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,180
completely severed from the plant other

89
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,640
than the connection right here and so

90
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,800
while most people would see this Branch

91
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,219
almost completely severed and just

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,680
decide to remove it sometimes it'll

93
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,979
choose to survive with this super super

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,980
cropping method and all of these

95
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,560
branches here as you can see will

96
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,780
actually start facing up towards the Sun

97
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,780
so that all of the buds can receive

98
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,759
proper light it's called tropism and it

99
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,459
causes the plants to look up to the sky

100
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,158
towards the light so even though this

101
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,439
plant received extreme amounts of damage

102
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,780
and this branch almost completely fell

103
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,780
off you can still see that it is

104
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,680
thriving even though it has been damaged

105
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,680
very heavily
