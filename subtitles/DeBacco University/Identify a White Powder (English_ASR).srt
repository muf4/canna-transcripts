00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,120
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,560
entitled identifying a white powder

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,638
here in this video we're going to be

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,320
looking at an unknown white powder

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,599
and some procedures and tests that can

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,839
be done to work towards identifying it

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,759
so here we're looking at a disclaimer

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,519
here that we'll be identifying in this

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,800
example some common household

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,719
items now those common household items

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,719
i've enlisted here again everything from

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,079
table salt baking soda table sugar

13
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,160
but i want you to realize that these

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,799
same concepts can be applied

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,759
to items that have increased toxicity

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,119
levels

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,199
now keep in mind that while the

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,039
substances themselves are unknown and

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
they might be just simple

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,200
household items may have lying around

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
just remember all laboratory safety

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,320
procedures should be followed

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,558
because we don't know what the substance

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
is and also some of the reagents used

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,599
might have increasing toxicity levels

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,719
themselves so

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
treat everything as dangerous and you'll

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
be

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
plenty safe following all the proper

30
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,280
safety procedures

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
so looking at again focusing on our

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,478
household items here

33
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,719
one common test that can be done is

34
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,359
simply solubility

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,879
insolubilities is a chemical property

36
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,679
referring to the ability of a given

37
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,079
substance

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
the solute to dissolve in a solvent how

39
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,879
well does it essentially dissolve

40
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,600
it's a measured in terms of the maximum

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,478
amount of

42
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,118
dissolved in a solvent at equilibrium so

43
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:24,798
how much

44
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,799
for example if we're looking at water

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,479
and we'll say simple table sugar

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
how much sugar can you put in that water

47
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,078
before you start to get a

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,359
it falls out of solution how much can it

49
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,478
suspend in there

50
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,359
what's its solubility so a water

51
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,840
solubility

52
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,118
test for example water solubility is one

53
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,960
of the most important and frequently

54
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,078
used physical chemical properties of

55
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,399
chemicals

56
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,158
this test to see if the substances is

57
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
polar meaning it will dissolve

58
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,439
or nonpolar the extreme example would be

59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
oil

60
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,959
and salt for example oil won't dissolve

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,759
in water because it's nonpolar

62
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,959
salt is an ionic compound it is polar

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,078
and therefore it will dissolve quite

64
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,839
well in there

65
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,519
you want to add about a quarter of a

66
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
gram of a sample to a test tube

67
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,438
and then add about five ml of water and

68
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,719
a stopper and shake that test tube

69
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,639
and then a judgment will have to be

70
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,959
determined whether the cell does

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,679
or does not completely dissolve in that

72
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,280
water

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
so again solubility test is a great

74
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,318
quick little test you can perform

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,598
then we get into hydrochloric acid

76
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,119
solubility

77
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,039
this follows the same concept as water

78
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,759
solubility but for some of the items

79
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,359
listed

80
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,359
here's a few there are a few hints

81
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,239
bicarbonates and carbonates react with

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,879
acid to form

83
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
carbon dioxide and bubbles will form

84
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,878
calcium sulfate in

85
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,159
in corn starch are not soluble in 10

86
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,679
hydrochloric acid

87
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,519
so that's kind of a little bit of a hint

88
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,200
there the rest of the powders

89
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,719
are soluble at least the ones listed in

90
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,479
those household

91
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,959
items list so this gives you an

92
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,119
indication for at least an initial step

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,719
for classifying what white powder you

94
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599
might be dealing with

95
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,680
then we have vinegar so bicarbonates and

96
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,639
carbonates react with the acetic acid

97
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,439
which is

98
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,799
basically the acid in vinegar vinegar is

99
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,239
five percent acetic acid

100
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
and they'll form carbon oxide bubbles as

101
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,959
we see here in the image in the beaker

102
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,839
it's the same as 10 hydrochloric acid

103
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
test so again

104
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
i want to typically do multiple tests to

105
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,439
confirm uh

106
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,039
what a substance we might be have as an

107
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,239
unknown white powder

108
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,519
we have the iodine test so starches

109
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,560
for example react with iodine to form a

110
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,158
blue complex

111
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
okay so i want to use about that a

112
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,759
quarter gram of powder

113
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,159
that you suspect to be cornstarch in a

114
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,479
test tube at two drops of

115
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,239
a tincture of iodine which is a solution

116
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,000
of iodine dissolved in alcohol

117
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
to the test tube in a few drops of water

118
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,318
and mix the contents and note the color

119
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,920
if it's kind of a yellow orange be a

120
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:44,878
negative if it's a purple black that

121
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,399
would be kind of a

122
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,560
positive test there going to iron

123
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,439
nitrate test so here we're going to

124
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,438
transfer about five

125
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,959
drops of the substances that were in the

126
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,799
water soluble

127
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,158
well plate test we're going to use those

128
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
same components from there

129
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,840
place a drop or two of the iron nitrate

130
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
solution in each test well

131
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,438
indicate a purple which is a positive

132
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,719
coloration as you can see here

133
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,039
or a light brown orange would be a

134
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,560
negative coloration now that purple if

135
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,239
it's well lit you can see that deep

136
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,158
purple color however it could almost

137
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
look black if we're depending on the

138
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,719
lighting so keep in mind

139
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,719
this would be an example again a

140
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,320
positive and a negative test if you have

141
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,799
it lit well you'll have that nice kind

142
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,959
of deep

143
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:28,159
purple color now the sodium hydroxide or

144
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,638
naoh test magnesium sulfate reacts with

145
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,280
sodium hydroxide naoh to form

146
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,720
insoluble magnesium hydroxide which is a

147
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,478
solid precipitate

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
okay so only about that quarter gram of

149
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,918
powder you suspect is magnesium sulfate

150
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
in a test tube and about five mils of

151
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,478
water

152
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
stopper and then shake the test tube to

153
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,360
dissolve the magnesium sulfate

154
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,519
add about 20 drops of the 0.2 molar

155
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,439
sodium hydroxide to the solution and

156
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,439
record your observations

157
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,120
this is again another great visual test

158
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,399
here

159
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,519
getting here we get a nice purple to a

160
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,399
nice pink color

161
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,399
of phenophalene test phenolphthalein is

162
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,638
often used as an indicator in acid-base

163
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,279
titrations and turns colors in acidic

164
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,759
solutions

165
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,679
in pink in basic ones so note that

166
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,680
phenolphthalein is slightly soluble in

167
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,918
water and usually dissolves in alcohols

168
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
for the for use in experiments we kind

169
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,839
of see that example here

170
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,399
of that ph of 8 to 12 we definitely have

171
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,439
that

172
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,519
pink coloration we have a ph here

173
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,560
a very acidic ph of that zero to eight

174
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,560
very clear

175
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
keep in mind though above 12 we can also

176
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,199
kind of get a clearing

177
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,120
of the solution um as well sometimes so

178
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,280
just be aware so that we add it as drops

179
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,038
we start to see that pretty pink color

180
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,478
we're indicating here that we have kind

181
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,918
of a base going on in that test tube

182
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,599
to get a little bit more precise we can

183
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,758
also go to ph testing this is

184
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,879
using a universal indicator can be used

185
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,120
to test the ph

186
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,800
of only water soluble substances via a

187
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,120
color change so keep that in mind

188
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,038
that it fails the water solubility test

189
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,439
the ph test is not going to be

190
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,959
one we want to use simply add drops of

191
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,240
the universal indicator directly to the

192
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,159
test tube of the water

193
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,439
solubility test and record the color and

194
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,360
that will help indicate

195
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,719
based on the color matching what ph

196
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,560
you're dealing with for those water

197
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,960
soluble substances

198
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,639
then we've got benedict's reagent this

199
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,879
is to test for simple sugars

200
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,240
i have the procedure all listed here

201
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,399
keep in mind banister reagent does

202
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,240
require the solution to be added mixed

203
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,439
and then heated in boiling water bath

204
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
for about three to five

205
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,519
minutes after that time you may observe

206
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,359
a color change of the solution or at

207
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,599
that time is when you want to observe

208
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
the potential for a color change you

209
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,039
have that aqua blue to kind of green

210
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,758
coloration that'd be a negative

211
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,519
test you have that yellow to orange that

212
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
would be an indication of a positive

213
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,159
test

214
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,839
after heating note this test cannot

215
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,919
detect the simple sugar

216
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,439
sucrose so again these all do have

217
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:52,240
limitations so just be mindful of those

218
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,680
now we have our birette's reagent here

219
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,478
and here we're looking at

220
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,439
the test for proteins so there's a

221
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,839
procedure

222
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,160
listed here i keep in mind that we want

223
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,519
to observe any color change again but we

224
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,439
want to allow this

225
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,038
reaction to curve potentially for up to

226
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,000
five minutes it's not a quick reaction

227
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,918
and go look at it

228
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,918
want to let it sit for about five

229
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,120
minutes and we have that kind of like

230
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,198
denim blue

231
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,038
coloration that would be negative if we

232
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
have that lavender purple coloration

233
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,639
that'd be indication of

234
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,639
a positive test so again hopefully this

235
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,680
helps kind of for the common household

236
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
substances

237
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,280
be able to determine what those white

238
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,879
powders are keep in mind to file all

239
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,839
laboratory

240
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,598
procedures stay safe even though they

241
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,439
have a low toxicity

242
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,879
some of these are reagents here we want

243
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,879
to be very careful with
