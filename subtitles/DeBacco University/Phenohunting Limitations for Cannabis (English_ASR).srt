1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,040
all right here in this debaco university

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,200
video we're going to be

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
exploring phenol hunting limitations in

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,280
regards to cannabis so while female

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,359
hunting is done quite frequently

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,239
with many plant types including cannabis

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,000
i'm going to mention some of the

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
limitations if you are deciding to go

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,519
down this particular route so first off

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,399
funeral hunting is the

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,000
is the basis for selection so growers

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,679
have been breeding based on phenotypes

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,599
for generations and it still works

14
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,039
it is performed to this day so it's not

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,599
something that's just completely going

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,640
away

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,039
just have to be aware of some of the

18
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,480
limitations we do select this method

19
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,000
however with advancements and other

20
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,718
techniques there are more refined

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,558
methods

22
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,000
for the selection process they can help

23
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,718
speed up the process

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,558
and allow growers to start looking at

25
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,200
different aspects or characteristics of

26
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,839
plants

27
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,120
that may not have been possible years

28
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,840
ago

29
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,718
so first off with any form of growing

30
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
with any form

31
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,239
of plant production documentation is

32
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,599
important

33
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,439
you want to be tracking individual

34
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
selection progression and also the

35
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,519
environments that they're grown

36
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,238
in all are important tools to aid in the

37
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,079
selection

38
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,079
process and this can just looking at

39
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,599
here we have the we have the date

40
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,118
we have the day we have the trench ups

41
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,399
made any notes we have some actual

42
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,438
samples of leaves

43
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,118
so be sure to kind of document

44
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,879
the process because that will help you

45
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,079
as a grower be able to refine your

46
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,319
techniques

47
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,280
also have an idea of what traits you are

48
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,758
breeding for

49
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,359
is this will help the always challenging

50
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,478
selection process

51
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,400
you might see something you might have

52
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,799
to change your plans but at least go

53
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,560
into with some idea or some direction

54
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
as far as what you ideally want to be

55
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,719
breeding for

56
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
so knowing the environment is also a key

57
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,959
factor there

58
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,319
so when pheno hunting the environment

59
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,879
has a great influence on the final

60
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,239
product

61
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,000
so this needs to be taken into

62
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,679
consideration just because something

63
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,879
performs well it does not mean it will

64
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
always perform well

65
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,158
by knowing the particular conditions

66
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
that it did perform well and

67
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
that might be helpful to the grower or

68
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
breeder that might be selecting

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
that variety or letting others grow that

70
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
variety as far as knowing

71
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,640
what conditions it may prefer or like to

72
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,798
get the maximum production out of it

73
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,560
now here's a prime example here when

74
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,959
we're looking at um

75
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,239
bonsai tree hunters looking at different

76
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
phenotype selections

77
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
well bonsai tree hunters thought they

78
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,439
hit the promised land when they went to

79
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,560
the beach and found dwarf types of

80
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,318
common trees

81
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,080
dwarf types were becoming very popular

82
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,079
in certain times however when they

83
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
brought those trees that were very dwarf

84
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
in appearance back to the greenhouses

85
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
to breed them out because they thought

86
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,878
they found some unique genetics

87
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,479
they brought those greenhouses and they

88
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,359
found all the plants grew essentially

89
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,719
normally

90
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
so why was this the case that plants

91
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,800
that were definitely smaller

92
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,080
in dwarf why did they grow normally well

93
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,599
this was because the plants were dwarfed

94
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
due to the environmental stresses such

95
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,560
as water salt and wind that those plants

96
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,719
were exposed to

97
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
and once given the more normal or

98
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,840
favorable growing conditions

99
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
they then changed their performance then

100
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,719
we see the same example here where

101
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,599
there's a bonsai tree in a very small

102
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,959
container

103
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,799
here's a tree growing in a parking lot

104
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
with a very limited root base and here's

105
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
a tree growing that has a much more

106
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,959
expansive

107
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,639
root base while these all may be the

108
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,479
same variety or type of tree

109
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,679
you can see that they can produce vastly

110
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,039
different results

111
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
and the same thing maybe that to this

112
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,639
extreme level is also can also be seen

113
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,439
in cannabis so you also need to consider

114
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,199
what is happening

115
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,199
inside the plant while you may be

116
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,119
breeding and making selections growers

117
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,238
really do not know what the genetics of

118
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
their plants are

119
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,158
establishing the basic lineage can help

120
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,759
provide an idea but once the final end

121
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,679
product is produced it may be wise to

122
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,359
get a genetic screen or profile done

123
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,719
to determine just how different the new

124
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
creation may be

125
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,919
so that this is not meant to be a

126
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,039
letdown but if you think you're bringing

127
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,798
something that's really different and

128
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,158
unique at least phenotypically at least

129
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
what you can physically see

130
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,359
when you get to that kind of end result

131
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,319
or more towards those end results when

132
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,879
you really think you have something

133
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:42,238
unique

134
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,158
getting it genetically screened or

135
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
profiled might be advantageous

136
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,519
really just to see how unique that plant

137
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,000
actually may be

138
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,120
is it really different and unique or is

139
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
it really

140
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,799
something that is an influence of the

141
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
environment and really hasn't changed

142
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
any of the genetics

143
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,639
it's good to kind of know that before

144
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
you start mass producing it and

145
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,598
spreading it out everywhere

146
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
if it's related to your environmental

147
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,919
growing conditions or if you really have

148
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,919
some very unique genetics
