00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,400
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
going to cover flood and drain or some

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,919
people call it the ebb and flow

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,278
irrigation method and related to

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:19,038
cannabis production

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,320
whether you call it flood and drain or

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,118
you call it ebb and flow

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,278
let's get into this method of irrigation

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,320
so first off the basics of this general

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,960
method of irrigation

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
is that plants are typically grown in

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,679
inner

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,359
substrate that is within a container

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,119
located in a growing tray

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,200
where nutrient-containing water is

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,919
pumped from the reservoir to the growing

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
tray

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,679
you kind of see that evident right here

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,920
in this very simple homeowners type

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,679
setup this essentially will flood the

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,760
tray allowing the substrate and roots to

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,079
absorb some of the nutrient solution

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,198
before the water slowly drains back into

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
the reservoir

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,198
this process also aids in the aeration

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,920
of the root zone

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,159
another benefit of this system now why

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,879
do growers like this system in general

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,759
well it's easy to automate and it's also

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,399
easy to set up

31
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,280
and really requires minimal parts and

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,359
equipment

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,879
the system is also scalable meaning it

34
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,679
can be used for if you're only growing

35
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,039
one plant

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,720
if you're growing hundreds if you're

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
growing thousands or more than that

38
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,359
of plants it can be applied to that

39
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,438
situation as we see in the images

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,519
presented here

41
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,519
now there's no perfect system so there

42
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,719
are some drawbacks to the system

43
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,798
the disadvantage of the system as of

44
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,319
any other hydroponic systems in general

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,400
is that if something goes wrong

46
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,359
even for a short period of time the

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
entire crop

48
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,319
could be a loss simply because they're

49
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,118
all dependent on that exact same water

50
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,798
source

51
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,399
this requires growers to carefully

52
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,118
monitor

53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,359
the process is essential this includes

54
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,719
nutrient concentrations as well as

55
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,000
ph values typical nutrient solutions are

56
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,319
changed every 7 to

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,118
10 days or so and the system should be

58
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,679
cleaned between

59
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,879
grow cycles or at any point that's

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
noticing that

61
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
it's justified or warranted looking at

62
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,839
the plants

63
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,000
looking at the trays and also the

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,439
reservoirs now what equipment

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
do you need if you're thinking about

66
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,318
employing this type of system

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
well a reservoir ideally with a lid a

68
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:19,519
growing tray to support the plants

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,080
and hold the flooding cycle tubing with

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,159
required fittings to attach everything

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
a water pump that's sized appropriately

72
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,239
for the size of the tray

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
a timer and plants that are potted in an

74
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,039
inert growing

75
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,719
substrate that will allow for absorption

76
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,239
of that nutrient solution

77
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,840
so a lot of times they're sold as kits

78
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
which is great this gives you just one

79
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,878
example

80
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,878
of a basic kind of components looking at

81
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,479
the flood and drain system

82
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,639
now what about the frequency and

83
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,959
duration some of the specifics

84
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,639
well how to best run your setup will

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
depend on a few factors

86
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,479
some of those factors include the age or

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
size of your plants

88
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,079
these substrate the plants are growing

89
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,158
in in general growing environment and

90
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,920
conditions temperature and humidity

91
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,359
so keep in mind the size and age the

92
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,039
older plants

93
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,800
larger plants are going to typically

94
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,158
require more water

95
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
the substrate the plants are growing and

96
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,239
how receptive is that substrate to water

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
is it holding water for an extended

98
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,200
period of time things to be in

99
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,878
consideration

100
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,039
and also the general growing environment

101
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,399
is it humid are you able to monitor

102
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,759
those conditions hopefully you're

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,039
monitoring those and able to keep those

104
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,878
in a good range

105
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,878
but if not if you have increased amounts

106
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,079
of temperature your frequency of

107
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,079
irrigation might be

108
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
a little bit higher however for a

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,840
starting point frequency should be two

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
irrigation events per day during a light

111
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,560
cycle

112
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
in a duration a 30 minute flood cycle

113
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,158
would be a good starting point

114
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,839
now this might be a little heavy so you

115
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,439
can always go a little bit lighter it's

116
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
just one way to kind of get a feel for

117
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,680
the system

118
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
30 minutes allows you a good time to

119
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
check to make sure everything's working

120
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
and you can kind of work it back down

121
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,319
from there as you see fit

122
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,319
as you monitor your plants so that you

123
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,798
dial in the frequency and duration

124
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,798
that best matches your conditions
