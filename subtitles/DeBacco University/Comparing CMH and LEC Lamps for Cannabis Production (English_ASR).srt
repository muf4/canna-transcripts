1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
one of the advantages of using cmh or

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,519
lec

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,759
lights is that the available lamp

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,399
options or bulb options that growers

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,480
have

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,719
so in this tobacco university video

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,920
we'll provide you with some comparisons

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,919
of some of the options that are

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
available

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,559
[Music]

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,559
let's get into some of the options you

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,879
have for lamps when you're looking at

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,719
cmh or lec lights

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,280
so first off i want to understand that

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,799
yes many options do exist

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
it's not just by one light and that's

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,359
what you're stuck with growers choice

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,600
are provided as a representative sample

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
here but i'm not sponsored nor is there

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,879
any connection with the company as part

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,480
of this comparison

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,159
they were selected for this comparison

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,718
simply do the options they provide in

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,919
lamps are a consistent cost with an msrp

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,600
is of this

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,039
video of 139 each full spectrum sheets

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
for each bulb is provided

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,640
for each as well the summary of options

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,879
in the 315 watt

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,319
are a 3100 kelvin full phase

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,799
3000 kelvin r which is red enhanced

32
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,478
4200k which is a daylight and a 10 000

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
finishing bulb and we can see them all

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,039
quickly compared here provide with a

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,560
little bit more detail on each

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,240
so first off that three of 3000

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,400
compared to the 3k r which is the

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,519
3000 kelvin so again it's referring to

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
the color temperature

40
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,840
so 3k overall is a good spectrum similar

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
to high pressure sodiums in that you can

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,439
grow a plant full term under it

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,520
but it is a little bit better suited for

44
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,239
flowering much like a high pressure

45
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,359
sodium

46
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,719
that's the 3 000 kelvin right here item

47
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,519
number provided

48
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,000
now the 3k r uh slight increase in the

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,560
uv light in comparison to promote resin

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
production

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
the 3kr has a taller peak in the far red

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
spectrum

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,118
as well so again slightly different or

54
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,438
slight shift

55
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,560
there on both the uv light and also the

56
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,718
far red spectrum

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
as well which might be advantageous for

58
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,319
some growers

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,840
now if we look here specifically at some

60
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,319
of the information provided by the

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,640
company

62
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,159
this is the 3k light it gives you all

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,639
the information here

64
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,840
spectrum and some of the details here so

65
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,759
you can pause the video

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,159
and take a look at uh that can compare

67
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,759
these different light or lamp sources

68
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,680
and there's that r you can see that

69
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,719
shift in the spectrum a lot of things

70
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,719
stayed the same

71
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,159
but what does change might again be

72
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,919
advantageous if you're looking at more

73
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,639
of that uv light and far red

74
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,598
end of the spectrum so looking at the 4k

75
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,919
light

76
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,280
again this is the 4000 kelvin similar to

77
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,559
natural sunlight i try to do a little

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,479
comparison here

79
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
it would the company says it's a metal

80
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,280
halide replacement

81
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,039
good if you're going to be moving plants

82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
outside after propagation in the sense

83
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
you'll be already exposing them

84
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,878
to similar wavelengths that they'll be

85
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,719
getting outside hopefully reducing

86
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,479
your hardening off time and your chance

87
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,120
of leaf burn as they transition to the

88
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:58,158
outside natural sun environment

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,239
now here's that 4k option there

90
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,598
and again that's 4000 kelvin different

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,200
little spectrum

92
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,719
and again you can see the similar

93
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,439
information here and you can compare

94
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,199
this to the ones previously shown

95
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,439
now the 10k finishing light this is kind

96
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,759
of an interesting one the goal here is

97
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,598
for

98
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,439
increased resin production as it

99
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,238
increases the plant's natural defense

100
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,560
response

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
to the increased amount of exposure it

102
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,158
has to the uv

103
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,640
light suggested to use only for the last

104
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,798
7 to 14 days of the flowering cycle

105
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,399
this light can be used for about 25 plus

106
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,599
flowering cycles before it needs to be

107
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,039
replaced

108
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,039
it's intended for growers looking to

109
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,840
maximize the quality of their cannabis

110
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,280
delivered end product so again it's a

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
major shift towards that uv

112
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
spectrum stressing the plant out

113
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,319
hopefully stressing in a good way

114
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,199
to increase some of the finishing

115
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,039
end resin compounds that a cannabis

116
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,158
plant would naturally want to produce

117
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,239
in response to this kind of wavelength

118
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,759
now here's that same kind of data sheet

119
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,120
that you can go through you can pause

120
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,280
look at a comparison

121
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
so here's just an example of using the

122
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,039
same ballast the same fixture

123
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,759
having these different lamp or bulb

124
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,239
options can really allow grow to dial in

125
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,840
their growing area can allow for very

126
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
easy kind of transition without having

127
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
to mess with all the ballasts just pop a

128
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,360
bulb out put another one in

129
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
and hopefully this helps provide you

130
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
with some information on some of the

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,839
options that exist

132
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,680
that you may want to take advantage of

133
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
to maximize your production
