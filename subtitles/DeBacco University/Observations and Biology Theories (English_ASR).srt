1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
here i want to cover an inference

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,759
compared to an observation

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,269
as well as the four theories that unify

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:15,280
biology

5
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:17,039
[Music]

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,519
now when we're looking here how do you

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,560
think the material in the purple bottle

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,759
compares to the yellow liquid i think

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,518
they smell

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
well based on what you're observing

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,518
you're making an inference

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,679
based on that here we see an image

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,280
observations or we can kind of measure

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,719
inferences or an animal made these and

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,600
the in a human made them they were

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,039
walking

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
earlier in that day we can kind of see

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,399
how they were made but be careful when

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
you're making observations

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,640
uh in inferences that you're not putting

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,640
your own bias into the situation

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,879
we also have the four theories that

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,279
unify

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,238
biology to cover those well because

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,719
we're talking about

26
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,919
theories we kind of define a theory now

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,558
in the general public a

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
theory is often used when there's a lack

29
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,000
of knowledge or a guess

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
however in the science world a theory is

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
a set of hypotheses that have

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,759
been tested many times and not rejected

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,799
and that's a definition we're going to

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
stick with

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,159
one example of a theory that you

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,118
probably very well experience

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
is the theory of gravity so we all know

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,438
gravity exists but that is technically a

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,519
theory getting into those four themes at

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,519
unified biology we have the

41
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,679
gene theory that's where information

42
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,920
that determines what organism is like

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
with genes located along the dna

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,719
molecule

45
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,560
and in the picture here we see these

46
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,759
chromosomes that all contain

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,560
segments of dna to progress from

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,640
dna we have cell theory and this is all

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,799
living organisms are composed of cells

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
cells are the basic units of life and

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,118
all cells come from

52
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,199
other cells and we also have the theory

53
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,000
of heredity where genes represent traits

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,118
of an organism

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,879
and are inherited as discrete units

56
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,399
we may see some genes that are inherited

57
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,679
or some traits that are carried over

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
from one generation

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
to the next we also have the theory of

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,318
evolution

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
so this theory of evolution is that all

62
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,878
organisms

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
are related to one another in a common

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,560
tree of life diversity of the living

65
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,878
world is a result of natural selection

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
this bird is a very stout beak for

67
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,639
opening seeds

68
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,119
this bird has a very pointed beak for

69
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,159
eating

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
its food or its prey items so again this

71
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:36,318
is kind of that four

72
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:36,318
themes that unify biology here
