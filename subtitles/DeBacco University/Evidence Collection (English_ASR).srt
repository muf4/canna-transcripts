1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,839
okay in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,759
we're going to be looking at the details

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,240
regarding evidence collection

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,240
how some specifics how they pertain to

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,638
some individual pieces of evidence

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
you might be looking at collecting keep

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,320
in mind you first want to define

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,000
the crime scene because crime scenes are

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,760
never consistent each is unique and

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,278
presents different challenges

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,880
you need to determine the area that will

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,559
be searched and ensure this is protected

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,160
from people entering and exiting so that

14
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,399
there's no alteration

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,920
whether intentional or unintentional of

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,439
the evidence that you're going to be

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,679
collecting

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
looking at performing the evidence

19
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,359
collection process

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
keep in mind this needs to be systematic

21
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,799
and detail oriented

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,719
you want to start with preliminary kind

23
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,320
of crime scene survey and walk through

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
they want to progress to determining the

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
evidence collected and search method

26
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,078
that you'll be utilizing

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
because since av crime scene is unique

28
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,198
you want to make sure you're utilizing

29
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
the best one to best fit the evidence

30
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,159
you intend on collecting

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,799
for the crime scene at hand now the goal

32
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,159
in all crime scene investigations and

33
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,079
evidence collection

34
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,560
is to help ensure that the evidence

35
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,920
you're collecting is of high integrity

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
the goal is to keep this evidence in its

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,680
original condition as it's found at the

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
crime scene whenever possible evidence

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,200
should be submitted to the laboratory

40
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,799
intact examples such as blood

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
hair fiber soil particles and other

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,600
types of trace evidence should not

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
normally be removed from garments

44
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,478
weapons or other articles

45
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,399
um that bear them you want to move the

46
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,640
whole article that contains that

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
into an ms collection bag or container

48
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
and give that to the lab

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
this entire object should be sent to the

50
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,679
laboratory for processing

51
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,000
there in the lab as you can see down

52
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,640
here everything can be kind of isolated

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
and contained to ensure or reduce the

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
odds of any potential

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,960
cross-contamination that would occur

56
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
now in order to keep this consistent you

57
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,519
want to make sure you're labeling

58
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,359
everything so all

59
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,959
containers must be marked and sealed

60
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,640
seen before moving

61
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,559
the item so this kind of gets to be a

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
little bit tedious task but is a very

63
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
important one

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
many items will have primary and

65
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,239
secondary containers you can see here

66
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,438
the primary container that's wrapped in

67
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,118
a secondary container

68
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,359
here may be placed in a plastic bottle

69
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,719
which then is placed in a paper bag

70
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,560
so there could be multiple kind of

71
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,239
areas where you're encasing this

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
evidence but keep in mind all needs to

73
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,360
be

74
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,239
labeled it's a tedious but very

75
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
necessary

76
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,800
process the reason why i say it's

77
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,239
tedious is labels have certain

78
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
requirements they could

79
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
require to put the case number the

80
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,359
offense the location of the offense the

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
date of the offense description of where

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
the evidence including any model or

83
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
serial numbers

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,519
collector's initials so all this kind of

85
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
needs to be documented for every piece

86
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
of evidence that's collected

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
this is part of kind of that chain of

88
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,359
custody you're establishing that initial

89
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,119
evidence

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
and then you're keeping track of also

91
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,280
where that is going

92
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
or where that may be shifted to now the

93
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
equipment for evidence

94
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,759
collection can be quite varied looking

95
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
at gloves and forceps and tweezers being

96
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,719
necessary especially looking at some of

97
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,759
that smaller trace evidence

98
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,639
scalpels and swabs paper bags for sure

99
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,560
for good storage containers plastic bags

100
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,479
often not advised in general but can be

101
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,439
used for some objects or inclusion of

102
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,518
others

103
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,280
cardboard boxes for larger items

104
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
wrapping paper thermometers a plastic

105
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,519
bucket for large objects to prevent them

106
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,199
from getting damaged

107
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
so as you can see the amount of

108
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,639
equipment needed is quite varied because

109
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,080
each is designed

110
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,839
to maximize different pieces of evidence

111
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,480
to eliminate the chance

112
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
of them being altered to a great deal

113
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,639
now this

114
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
physical evidence is typically we think

115
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,919
of initially as evidence

116
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
with any evidence the goals to prevent

117
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,598
any alterations from the time it

118
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
collected to once received in the actual

119
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,119
lab and that physical evidence that

120
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,959
transporting it here into the

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,319
plastic cup here we're taking a

122
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,080
documenting photographs

123
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,839
and then lifting prints maybe collecting

124
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
what we see on the ground and then

125
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
putting into paper bags as an example

126
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,598
when we're handling this physical

127
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,199
evidence in general we want to make sure

128
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,759
that we're photographing it to begin

129
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,039
with

130
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,560
we want to handle in a way that

131
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,239
maintains the integrity of the sample

132
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,239
which is often a way it's not

133
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
normal for an object for example you

134
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,878
don't want to grab a firearm by the grip

135
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
when you go to pick it up you want to

136
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:08,959
grab it

137
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,319
because that's typically where the

138
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
fingerprints may be you want to grab it

139
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,399
in a way that might be a little awkward

140
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
but will preserve the integrity where

141
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,918
someone normally would hold that

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,478
particular piece of evidence

143
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,079
when we're packing that evidence there

144
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,359
we want to use separate containers

145
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,360
for different items collected at

146
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,840
different locations this is intended to

147
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,319
reduce the chance of damage or

148
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,159
cross-contamination

149
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,439
we could see those paper bags being used

150
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,320
we see metal cans we see this cardboard

151
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,199
for syringes or sharps or knives being

152
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,120
placed in foam

153
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
inside a round plastic container here

154
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
and sealed being zip tied to the bottom

155
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,039
of this cardboard box

156
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,439
all ways that we can ensure proper

157
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,080
packing of physical evidence

158
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,439
now the standard packaging requirements

159
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,120
we're looking at for general items are

160
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,319
placed in appropriately sized containers

161
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,439
this is why

162
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,399
investigators will carry so many

163
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,600
different sizes make sure it's

164
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,799
appropriate size for the evidence

165
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
they're collecting

166
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
knives if a folding knife if found open

167
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,599
do not

168
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
fold it closed it should be placed in

169
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,400
separate separate sharps tubes

170
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
a folding knife and found closed it

171
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,120
should be secured with tape so that the

172
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,400
blade doesn't open

173
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
and then it should be placed in a

174
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,679
plastic sharps tube this is not only to

175
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
preserve

176
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,439
the evidence itself but also to protect

177
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,319
you as the investigator from getting any

178
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,800
sort of harm

179
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,560
from the objects you're collecting now

180
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
some specific requirements so for

181
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
example here for any

182
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,359
narcotics that might be collected at the

183
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,400
scene there's a whole host

184
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
of kind of processes to go through keep

185
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,879
in mind packet

186
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,240
package all found or kayaks are

187
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,439
dangerous substances and should be in

188
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
paper l

189
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,600
paper isolated envelopes keep drug

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,038
paraphernalia in separate packaging

191
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
you want to weigh in document each type

192
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,519
of drug in its entirety including the

193
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
packaging

194
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,959
you want to conduct a presumptive test

195
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
to give an idea what it may be

196
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,000
and seal the evidence tape with your

197
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
initials in your date

198
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
once packaged you weigh them again in

199
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,719
the complete packaging and write the

200
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
gross weight on the outside of the

201
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
package

202
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,360
again so this is important to keep that

203
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,959
documentation step going those way and

204
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,439
going as well

205
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,079
for firearms packaging we want to take

206
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,759
pictures before

207
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,599
moving the firearm so that's a key part

208
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
right there make note the position of

209
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,840
the bolt and slide and chamber and

210
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,519
hammer

211
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,279
where the safety's placed position of

212
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,318
the cylinder and any cartridges that are

213
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,079
found

214
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,479
for handling be sure to secure the

215
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,279
weapon by eliminating part of the gun

216
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,879
from moving

217
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,359
and you can see that evident here in

218
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,360
these cardboard boxes with zip ties

219
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
caution is this may not involve

220
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
unloading of the firearm

221
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,879
when it packages the fire you can also

222
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,359
package it potentially in plastic

223
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,560
but make sure any ammunition is packaged

224
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
separately that is

225
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
found so again certain requirements here

226
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,879
for packaging up

227
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,319
firearms we're looking at our trace

228
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,439
evidence our hair our fiber and our

229
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,479
glass and other

230
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,639
examples of trace evidence typically

231
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,478
plastic bottles are used

232
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
with pressure lids because they're great

233
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,680
options for this

234
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,439
paper bags are a good choice for larger

235
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
objects we want to avoid the mailing

236
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,598
envelopes that's why we kind of like

237
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,319
those little

238
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,120
sealable kind of plastic containers

239
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,280
there

240
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,399
different sizes again to match the piece

241
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,519
of evidence

242
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,198
that we're specifically collecting the

243
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,038
proper techniques for liquids so keep in

244
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,639
mind what evidence must be air dried

245
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,159
before it's put in a container because

246
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,120
it might be altered when placed in that

247
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,880
container

248
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
when suspected biological evidence is

249
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,918
found on clothing or other

250
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,439
absorbent surfaces transport to the

251
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,879
laboratory an appropriate container

252
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,879
moves the entire substance

253
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,560
possible whatever should not be folded

254
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,159
over on itself use

255
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,839
paper wrapping to prevent contamination

256
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,520
during the transfer process

257
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,959
items should be air dried thoroughly in

258
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,478
a drying locker and packaged in a

259
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,879
container suitable for

260
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,399
dried evidence this means avoid airtight

261
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,399
containers to the increased chance of

262
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,679
mold growth over a period of time

263
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,758
this evidence may not get looked at

264
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,840
right away this if the suspected

265
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,598
biological evidence is liquid form on a

266
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,359
fixed surface that cannot be transported

267
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,959
for example like a concrete floor

268
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
the substance should be recovered using

269
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,239
a dried material collection

270
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,120
technique that's the only way it should

271
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,879
be removed from the actual crime scene

272
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,399
that dried material kind of moving it

273
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,680
through make sure you're always using a

274
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,519
gloved hands

275
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,120
slightly motion a swab with distilled

276
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,079
water the swab should be dampened out

277
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
overly wet

278
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,279
thoroughly rub the stain using a single

279
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
motion swab for

280
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,478
a small stain and multiple swabs for a

281
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,160
larger scene

282
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,918
i air dry the swabs and then place those

283
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,560
swabs in separate labeled packaging that

284
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,359
may be placed inside a paper envelope

285
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,199
collective substances control a sample

286
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,400
as well from an unstained area using the

287
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
same techniques

288
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,598
and be sure to label it so as you can

289
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
see again this

290
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,958
is certain techniques that are needed

291
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
depending on what material you're

292
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
collecting

293
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,718
there are certain techniques that must

294
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,439
be followed and be sure that you're

295
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
labeling

296
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,719
everything so that all this evidence can

297
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,958
not only be

298
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,879
utilized in the future but can have that

299
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,799
proper documentation step so it can

300
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,799
uphold itself in court
