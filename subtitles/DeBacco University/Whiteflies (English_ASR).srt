1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
here we're gonna look at the common

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,028
plant pest called white flies now it's

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:07,289
advantageous when the name kind of

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:10,169
matches what they look like and they do

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,900
look like small white flies since

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,179
they've like in the close-up version and

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,789
here's a elevated population on the

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,289
underside of this leaf here so the

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,330
identification they're about one

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,710
millimeter long and a white moth like

11
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,719
look to them but I look like little

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,490
flies yellow sticky traps can be used

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,140
for monitoring so it's good if you're

14
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,329
implementing those and close to your

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,969
plants to be able to capture these for

16
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:34,829
monitoring purposes these white flies

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,530
damage plants by sucking the SAP and

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,030
vectoring the plant viruses as well so

19
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,640
not only is it the physical damage they

20
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,450
can do but some of the viruses that they

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,390
can infect her can also be a way to kind

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,600
of reduce plants yield and cause disease

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,859
to spread from plant to plant now where

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,629
to look for them they're typically found

25
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,390
on the underside of the leaves and see a

26
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,218
high population here a damage can be

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,359
mistaken for eight hit damage initially

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,609
so it's important to kind of do that

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,899
inspection not to say oh that's small

30
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,750
insects kind of look a little bit closer

31
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,189
and do you see the small white flies if

32
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,569
you bump the plants you might notice if

33
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:11,099
the fly is going to show themselves they

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,978
kind of fly out and around and kind of

35
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,329
retreat back to the plant glaze up to

36
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,280
the leaves with sticky honeydew is a

37
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,228
signature sign that white flies are

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,750
nearby because of the piercing sucking

39
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,640
that they are able to do to that leaf

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,728
they can kind of get that kind of glaze

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,829
kind of sticky nice honeydew look as the

42
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,200
sap from the plant the sugars are kind

43
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:33,629
of being released because of the feeding

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,180
that's occurring how to prevent them

45
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,310
well if you're an outdoor growing avoid

46
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,579
Berg eggplant the sweet potato tobacco

47
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,890
or tomatoes as these can be very common

48
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,750
host for white flies particularly

49
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,099
Tomatoes I've seen completely covered in

50
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,200
white flies so it can be kind of a

51
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,599
breeding ground for that you want a bag

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,829
and remove heavily infected plants Oster

53
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,530
you're limiting any kind of

54
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,849
cross-contamination if you're in indoor

55
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,079
girl you don't wanna pull one plant out

56
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,669
and drag it down the hallway because

57
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,500
that can be picked up in the ventilation

58
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,519
and other plants can become infected

59
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,780
that way how to control them well it's

60
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,969
very difficult but there's biological

61
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,159
control such as parasitic wasps but it

62
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,830
can be used in cursive Formosa is very

63
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,539
common it can offer effective

64
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,150
control but keep in mind these have a

65
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,819
tendency to be attracted to HID lights

66
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,039
those high intensity lights and sadly

67
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,479
they can kind of fly to their death as a

68
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,819
result if you're going to be using this

69
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,619
kind of parasitic wasps typically want

70
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,719
to find it or put it deep into the

71
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,000
canopy where it's more shaded from the

72
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,469
plant leaves someday or another option

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,090
since these can affect white flies

74
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:37,830
through their skin and in small

75
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,740
operations it's possible to live vacuum

76
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,910
them up white flies by shaking the plant

77
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,980
shaking the plant have gone through and

78
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,079
literally evacuating them up to reduce

79
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,549
their numbers this shows it tomato leaf

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,770
with white flight nymphs that are the

81
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,230
white and parasitized ones that are

82
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,939
black so you can see here this is a good

83
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,889
sign that the biological control is

84
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,329
doing his job it takes a little time for

85
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,759
it to get established and spread through

86
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,940
the area but if established properly it

87
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,659
can be a method of effective control for

88
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,659
white flies
