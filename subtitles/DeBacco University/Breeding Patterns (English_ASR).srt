1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,779
okay here we're gonna investigate

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,469
different breeding patterns for

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,299
different animals and how they go about

4
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:11,820
conceiving to carry on to the next

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,798
generation so starting with this

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,079
variation in reproduction among

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,989
vertebrates species and also in

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,198
vertebrates as we see here with our

9
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,839
grasshoppers

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,750
so vertebrates are sexual reproduction

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,670
variation most marine bony fish whose

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,259
external fertilization and this is where

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,359
male and female gametes are released

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,429
into the water where fertilization can

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,859
occur so this is where we have our

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,289
female fish here and our male here is

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,390
the large hook jaw here they can tell

18
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,460
the difference these salmon will go into

19
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,590
very shallow water and the female will

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,179
release eggs in this gravel and the male

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,520
will then release the sperm on top of

22
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,409
that most other Brits use with these

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,480
grasshoppers do if it's internal

24
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,339
fertilization where the male gametes are

25
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,750
introduced into the female reproductive

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,129
tract specifically this is very specific

27
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,320
versus here there's many many eggs

28
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,058
produced in the hopes that some will be

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,109
able to come fertilize and some will

30
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:06,359
make it in the wild

31
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,640
sadly these salmon then will die shortly

32
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,560
after spawning and that's kind of a good

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,590
thing because believe it or not these

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,810
small fry or these small fish will feed

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,000
off the dead sam and so that they can

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,129
have initial sources of nutrients in

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,209
areas that are typically very low in

38
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:26,489
nutrients now looking at the mammalian

39
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,419
species and breeding patterns some are

40
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:29,849
seasonal breeders

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,650
oh there's every productive cycles so

42
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,599
reproductive cycles are periods of

43
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,460
release of mature ovum or basically

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,559
mature egg most female mammals have

45
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,780
estrus cycles these were females are

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,930
sexually receptive to males only around

47
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,049
a certain time of ovulation this is

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,780
typically when dogs are in heat this is

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,899
when those females are ready basically

50
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,879
for mating other examples we have quail

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,489
which are we call long day breeders and

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,618
sheep which are short day breeders so

53
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,078
some are very seasonally influenced in

54
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,959
the versus the winter versus the summer

55
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,478
months this is why and certain animals

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,969
can be very well predicted when they're

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,010
going to give a litter or give rise to

58
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,139
young they have these very

59
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,878
distinctive cycles and the females are

60
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:22,229
only receptive to the male's at that

61
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:24,268
time I will also have for apes and

62
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,969
humans females have what we call

63
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,450
menstrual cycles is where females will

64
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,620
bleed or shed inner lining of the uterus

65
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,568
they can calculate which means to have

66
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,030
sex at any time during there's their

67
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:38,429
cycle and we see the evidence here of

68
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,158
that cycle that does occur and we have

69
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,469
that releasing of the egg and in that

70
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,878
period of ovulation which is very small

71
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:47,280
who knows there's a lot of hormone

72
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,858
changes that do occur in the sense of

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,709
the body temperature is also altering

74
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:54,989
and this is helping the women is to

75
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,180
conceive to create a favorable

76
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:01,799
environment for that egg to become

77
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,780
fertilized and mature into a zygote the

78
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,730
last part here cats and rabbits are

79
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,680
unique they're what's called induced

80
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,318
ovulate errs and they a valley after

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,700
copulation due to LH secretion and

82
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,369
Ellie's just a hormone here we can see

83
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,048
that surge that's occurred this is what

84
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,299
allows cats and rabbits to kind of

85
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:22,049
multiply so quickly is that they ovulate

86
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:25,019
only after they have sex essentially

87
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,719
this allows them to breed at a very

88
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,650
rapid rate on them to populate areas

89
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,650
very quickly
