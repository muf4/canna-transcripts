1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,869
okay here I'm gonna cover the basics for

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,960
field preparation first wash planting

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,330
now you could do the traditional disking

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,609
method here until in of the entire field

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,919
or some people are going to it's called

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,079
a no-till operation they're spraying an

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,420
herbicide down the center path here what

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,118
we'll be planting the individual squash

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,150
seeds now allowing a green kind of cover

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:27,268
crop to exist in between the rows so two

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:30,059
different ways to approach preparation

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,198
from field to squash now in general

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,539
squash are native to the Americas

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,829
considered the new world and it's part

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,589
like perform well in the New England

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,530
climate so we tend to perform them quite

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,129
well and get good harvest with not

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,689
necessarily a ton of its special inputs

19
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:48,539
so when we're looking for a grow site to

20
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,448
evaluate we want a good field conditions

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,698
we define as those that have full Sun

22
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:55,170
well-drained in a near neutral pH now

23
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:57,929
because I tend to do well in this area

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,000
and they tend that to have the greatest

25
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,579
return on investment in comparison to

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,049
say like a tomato these crops are

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,150
commonly planted in what's called the

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,100
next-best plot we've been at the best

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,960
most ideal field but the next best field

30
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:14,429
now when we're preparing our fields for

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,109
squash they don't have to be first on

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,189
the list they can be later on the list

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:22,079
because squash perform warm field soil

34
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:24,029
preparations are coming to later in on

35
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,670
the list or later in the season in

36
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,219
comparison to other fields Dennis Lee is

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,799
Memorial Day sometimes eaten slightly

38
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,500
later getting into June at least early

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,939
June because they like that warm soil so

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,799
when planted they kind of jump up and

41
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,618
get going so they may not be the first

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,210
prey prepared they should be in your

43
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:47,519
rotation and wait until that soil gets

44
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,359
warm if you plant them too early they

45
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,359
will not perform well
